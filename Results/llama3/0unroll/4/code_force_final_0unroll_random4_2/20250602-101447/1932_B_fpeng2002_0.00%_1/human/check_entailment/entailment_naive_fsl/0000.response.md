Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the periodicities are all 1, the start year is incremented by 1 for each sign.
* When the periodicities are all the same, the start year is incremented by that periodicity for each sign.
* When the periodicities are different, the start year is updated correctly to be the next multiple of each periodicity after the previous sign's start year.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input list is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
