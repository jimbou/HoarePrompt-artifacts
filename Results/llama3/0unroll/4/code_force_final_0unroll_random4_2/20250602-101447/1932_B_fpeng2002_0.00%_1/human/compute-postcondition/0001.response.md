Output State: **num_tests = 0, start_year = the last calculated start_year value**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `num_tests` is set to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `start_year` holds the last calculated start year value from the last test case. The state of other variables in the precondition, such as the input stream, remains unchanged.
