This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates a "start year" value for each test case by iteratively updating a running total based on the given integers. The calculated start year value for each test case is printed to standard output. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.
