Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign will occur. It then iterates over the periodicities of the signs, updating the `start_year` variable for each sign.

The update formula for `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula calculates the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient. The `+ 1` is used to ensure that the next occurrence is strictly after the previous occurrence.

After updating `start_year` for all signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year of the apocalypse.

Correctness: **True**
