Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, `num_tests` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `num_tests` test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
