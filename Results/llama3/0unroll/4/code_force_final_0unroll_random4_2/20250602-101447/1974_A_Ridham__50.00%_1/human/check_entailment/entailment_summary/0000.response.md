Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (x) and the 2x2 icons (y). 

2. It then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (y). If y is even, it requires y//2 screens. If y is odd, it requires y//2 + 1 screens because a single 2x2 icon will occupy the entire screen.

3. It then calculates the remaining cells in the screens required for the 2x2 icons. This is 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y.

4. If the space required for the 1x1 icons (x) is less than or equal to the remaining cells, it means that the 1x1 icons can fit in the screens required for the 2x2 icons. So, it appends screen_require_for_y to the result list.

5. If the space required for the 1x1 icons (x) is more than the remaining cells, it means that additional screens are required for the 1x1 icons. It calculates the extra space required for the 1x1 icons (extra_space) and the additional screens required (extra_screen). It then appends the sum of screen_require_for_y and extra_screen to the result list.

6. Finally, it prints the result list, which contains the minimum number of screens required for each input pair (x, y).

Correctness: **True**
