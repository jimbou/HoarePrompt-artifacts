Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers, where each pair represents an edge in the tree, and the integers in each pair are between 1 and n (inclusive).
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `g` now represents an adjacency list of the undirected graph with `n` nodes and `k` edges, where each index `i` in `g` corresponds to a node `i` in the graph, and the value at index `i` is a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i` by an edge. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

            l = mid + 1
        else:

    #State: l = r + 1, r is the largest value for which check(r) returns False.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the largest value for which check(r) returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with a specified number of nodes and edges, and then performs a binary search to find the largest value for which a certain condition (defined by the `check` function) returns False. The function prints this largest value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree.

    #
    #The loop executes a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree represented by the dictionary g. It starts at node 1 and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The stack is used to keep track of the nodes to be visited, and the visited set is used to avoid visiting the same node twice.
    #
    #The dictionary d is used to keep track of the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node. The value of d[x] is initially set to 1 when node x is first visited, and then incremented by the value of d[node] for each neighbor node of x that is not the parent of x.
    #
    #The variable r is used to count the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A. When a node x is backtracked (i.e., when it is removed from the stack), if its value d[x] is greater than or equal to A, r is incremented by 1.
    #
    #After the loop finishes executing, the stack is empty because all nodes have been visited and removed from the stack. The visited set is also empty because all nodes have been removed from it after being backtracked. The dictionary d has only one key-value pair, (1, A), because all other nodes have been removed from it after being backtracked. The value of r is the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A.
    if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: *stack is an empty list, visited is an empty set, d is a dictionary with key 1 and value A, r is the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A. Additionally, r is less than or equal to k and either d[1] is less than A or r is not equal to k
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the condition for the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A (denoted by 'r') is not met, where 'r' is less than or equal to 'k' and either the value of node 1 (denoted by 'd[1]') is less than A or 'r' is not equal to 'k'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of neighboring nodes, has a certain number of nodes with a value greater than or equal to a specified threshold (A), after removing a specified number of edges (k). It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. The function performs a depth-first search on the tree, counting the number of nodes with a value greater than or equal to A, and checks if this count is greater than k or if the count is equal to k and the value of the root node is greater than or equal to A.
