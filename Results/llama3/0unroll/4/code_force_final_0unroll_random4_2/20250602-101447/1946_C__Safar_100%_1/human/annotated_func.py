    #State: Output State: The list `g` now represents an adjacency list of the undirected graph with `n` nodes and `k` edges, where each index `i` in `g` corresponds to a node `i` in the graph, and the value at index `i` is a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i` by an edge.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with a specified number of nodes and edges, and then performs a binary search to find the largest value for which a certain condition (defined by the `check` function) returns False. The function prints this largest value.

    #The loop executes a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree represented by the dictionary g. It starts at node 1 and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The stack is used to keep track of the nodes to be visited, and the visited set is used to avoid visiting the same node twice.
    #
    #The dictionary d is used to keep track of the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node. The value of d[x] is initially set to 1 when node x is first visited, and then incremented by the value of d[node] for each neighbor node of x that is not the parent of x.
    #
    #The variable r is used to count the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A. When a node x is backtracked (i.e., when it is removed from the stack), if its value d[x] is greater than or equal to A, r is incremented by 1.
    #
    #After the loop finishes executing, the stack is empty because all nodes have been visited and removed from the stack. The visited set is also empty because all nodes have been removed from it after being backtracked. The dictionary d has only one key-value pair, (1, A), because all other nodes have been removed from it after being backtracked. The value of r is the number of nodes in the tree with a value greater than or equal to A.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of neighboring nodes, has a certain number of nodes with a value greater than or equal to a specified threshold (A), after removing a specified number of edges (k). It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. The function performs a depth-first search on the tree, counting the number of nodes with a value greater than or equal to A, and checks if this count is greater than k or if the count is equal to k and the value of the root node is greater than or equal to A.
