Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the binary search algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The `func_1` function initializes the graph and calls the `check` function with a binary search approach to find the maximum x. The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to count the number of connected components with size at least A.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of vertices is 1 or when k is 0. The binary search approach ensures that the program finds the maximum x efficiently.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
