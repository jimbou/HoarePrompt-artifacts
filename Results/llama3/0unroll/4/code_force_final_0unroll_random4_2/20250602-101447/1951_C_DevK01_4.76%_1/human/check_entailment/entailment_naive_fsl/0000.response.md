Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m). In this case, the program should only consider the first k days, but it currently considers the first q days, where q is the ceiling of k/m. This can lead to incorrect results when k < m.

For example, if n = 5, m = 3, k = 2, and the prices are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will consider the first 2 days (q = 2) and calculate the cost as 2 * (1 + 2) + 2 * 2 * (1 * 2 // 2) = 12, which is incorrect. The correct cost is 2 * 1 + 1 * 2 = 4.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
