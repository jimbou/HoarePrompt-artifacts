The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
