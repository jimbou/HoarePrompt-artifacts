Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, and the number of tickets to be bought k.
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.
4. The program sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days q required to buy k tickets.
5. It then calculates the cost of buying k tickets by considering two cases:
   - If the number of days q is equal to the number of tickets k divided by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, plus the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m squared, multiplied by the number of days q minus 1, divided by 2.
   - If the number of days q is not equal to the number of tickets k divided by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, it calculates the cost as the price of the ticket on the last day multiplied by the remaining number of tickets to be bought, plus the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, plus the sum of the prices of the tickets on each day multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m squared, multiplied by the number of days q minus 2, divided by 2, plus the number of days q minus 1, multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, multiplied by the remaining number of tickets to be bought.
6. Finally, it prints the calculated cost.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets and handles all the edge cases.
