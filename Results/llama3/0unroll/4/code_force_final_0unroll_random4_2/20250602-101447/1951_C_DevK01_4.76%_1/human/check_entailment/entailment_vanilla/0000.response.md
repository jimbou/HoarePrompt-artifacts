Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k). It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days (a_i).

3. The program sorts the prices per ticket in ascending order.

4. It calculates the minimum number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m).

5. It then calculates the cost of buying k tickets. If the total number of tickets to be bought is exactly divisible by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices per ticket for the first q days by m, and then adds the additional cost due to the increase in prices per ticket for the remaining days.

6. If the total number of tickets to be bought is not exactly divisible by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), it calculates the cost by multiplying the price per ticket for the last day by the remaining number of tickets to be bought, and then adds the cost of buying the remaining tickets in the previous days.

7. Finally, it prints the minimum cost required to purchase k tickets.

Based on the above analysis, the program seems to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
