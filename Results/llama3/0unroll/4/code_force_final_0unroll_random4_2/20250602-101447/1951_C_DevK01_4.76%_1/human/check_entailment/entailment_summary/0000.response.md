Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, t, and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k).
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.
4. The program sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days required to buy k tickets, which is q = ceil(k / m).
5. It then calculates the cost of buying k tickets by considering two cases:
   a. If n * m == k, it means that we can buy all k tickets in n days without exceeding the maximum limit m. In this case, the cost is calculated as m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2), where N is the sorted list of prices.
   b. If n * m != k, it means that we cannot buy all k tickets in n days without exceeding the maximum limit m. In this case, the program calculates the cost by buying k - (n - 1) * m tickets on the last day and the remaining tickets on the previous days.
6. Finally, the program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the maximum limit m, the number of tickets k, and the number of sale days n. It also correctly calculates the cost by considering the sorted prices and the minimum number of days required to buy k tickets.

Correctness: **True**
