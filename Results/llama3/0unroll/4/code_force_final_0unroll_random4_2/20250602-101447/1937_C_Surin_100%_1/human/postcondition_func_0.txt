The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case represents a permutation of integers. For each test case, it queries the input to find the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation and outputs the indices of these elements. The function performs a series of comparisons to determine the maximum and second maximum elements, and it outputs the results in a specific format, with each result consisting of a pair of indices.
