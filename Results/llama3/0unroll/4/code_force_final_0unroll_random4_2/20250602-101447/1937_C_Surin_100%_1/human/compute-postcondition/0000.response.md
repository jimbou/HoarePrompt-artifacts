The code defines two lambda functions, `I` and `R`, which are used to read input from stdin. The `I` function reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list. The `R` function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it.

After executing the code, the output state is:

Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^4) followed by n integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} representing a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The lambda functions I and R are defined to read input from stdin.**

In this output state, the stdin still contains the same input as before, but now the lambda functions `I` and `R` are defined and can be used to read input from stdin. The values of `t`, `n`, and the permutation integers `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` are not changed by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
