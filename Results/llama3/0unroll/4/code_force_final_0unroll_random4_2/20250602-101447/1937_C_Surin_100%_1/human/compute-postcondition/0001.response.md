Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing either a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!) followed by four space-separated integers. The question mark lines represent queries to the input, and the exclamation mark lines represent the final answer for each test case. The final answer for each test case is a pair of integers, where the first integer is the index of the maximum element in the permutation, and the second integer is the index of the second maximum element in the permutation. The output state does not contain the input integers t, n, and p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}.**
