Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the index v1 of the maximum value in the permutation p using n-1 queries. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum value.

2. Then, it finds the index prev of the second maximum value in the permutation p using n-1 queries. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum value and the second maximum value.

3. Finally, it prints the pair of indices prev and v1, which maximizes the XOR operation.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly handles the case when n = 2, where p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0], and p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.
