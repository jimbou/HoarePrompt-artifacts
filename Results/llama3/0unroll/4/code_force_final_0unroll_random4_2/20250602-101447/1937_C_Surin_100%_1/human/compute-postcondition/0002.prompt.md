You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^4) followed by n integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} representing a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The output state is a series of lines, each containing either a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!) followed by four space-separated integers. The question mark lines represent queries to the input, and the exclamation mark lines represent the final answer for each test case. The final answer for each test case is a pair of integers, where the first integer is the index of the maximum element in the permutation, and the second integer is the index of the second maximum element in the permutation. The output state does not contain the input integers t, n, and p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
