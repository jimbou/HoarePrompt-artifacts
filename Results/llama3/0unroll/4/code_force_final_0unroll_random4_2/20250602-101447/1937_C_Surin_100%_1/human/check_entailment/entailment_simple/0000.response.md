Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the interactive problem of finding two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a query-based approach, where it asks the jury for comparisons between bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation.

The program first finds the index v1 of the maximum element in the permutation by repeatedly asking queries of the form "? v1 v1 v2 v2" and updating v1 if the result is '<'. This is done in the first loop.

Next, the program finds the index prev of the second maximum element in the permutation. It does this by iterating over the remaining elements and asking queries of the form "? v1 i v1 prev". If the result is '>', it updates prev to i. If the result is '=', it asks another query of the form "? i i prev prev" to determine whether i or prev is the second maximum element.

Finally, the program prints the pair of indices prev and v1 as the answer.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted, and the program flushes the output after each query and after printing the final answer.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
