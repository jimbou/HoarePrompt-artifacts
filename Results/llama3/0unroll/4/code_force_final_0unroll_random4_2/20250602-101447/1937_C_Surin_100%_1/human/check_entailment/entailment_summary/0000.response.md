Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find the maximum and second maximum elements in a permutation of integers. The program uses a series of comparisons to determine the maximum and second maximum elements and outputs the results in the required format.

The program first finds the maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum. Once the maximum element is found, it then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current second maximum. The program ensures that the second maximum element is not the same as the maximum element.

The program uses the required format for outputting the results, which consists of a pair of indices representing the maximum and second maximum elements.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
