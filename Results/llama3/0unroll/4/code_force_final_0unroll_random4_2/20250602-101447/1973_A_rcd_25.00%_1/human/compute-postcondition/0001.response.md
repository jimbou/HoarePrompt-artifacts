Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the maximum number of points that can be scored by the three players in each test case, or -1 if it is not possible to score any points. The list will have the same number of elements as the number of test cases, and each element will be the result of the calculations performed inside the loop for the corresponding test case.**
