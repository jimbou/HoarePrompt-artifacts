Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program iterates through multiple test cases, each containing the scores of the three players.

The program first checks if the total score of the three players is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. This is because, in a valid set of games, the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total score).

If the total score is even, the program checks if the highest score (p3) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2). If it is, the program prints the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2), which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

If the highest score is not greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened by iterating through possible values of draws between the players. The program starts with the minimum possible number of draws (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)) and increments it until it finds a value that satisfies the condition p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur). If such a value is found, the program prints the corresponding maximum number of draws (p1 - cur + p3). If no such value is found, the program prints the highest score (p3).

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
