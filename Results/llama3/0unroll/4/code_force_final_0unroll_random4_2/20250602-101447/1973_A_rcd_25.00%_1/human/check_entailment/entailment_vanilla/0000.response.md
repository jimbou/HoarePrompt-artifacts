Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves on to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point for each player).

4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If it is, the program prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is because in this case, the maximum number of draws occurs when the player with the highest score wins all their games against the other two players, and the other two players draw all their games against each other.

5. If `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws by finding the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores. It then iterates over this range, starting from the minimum difference, and checks if the current difference can result in a valid set of scores. If it can, the program prints the current difference plus `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

6. If the program iterates over the entire range without finding a valid set of scores, it prints `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem and handle all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
