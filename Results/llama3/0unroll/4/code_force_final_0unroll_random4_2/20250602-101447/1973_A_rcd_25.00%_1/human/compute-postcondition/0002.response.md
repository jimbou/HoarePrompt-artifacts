Functionality: **Calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by three players in a game, given their scores, and outputs the results for multiple test cases. The function takes no arguments, reads input from stdin, and prints the results. For each test case, it either outputs -1 if the total score is odd or the maximum achievable score based on the players' scores, following specific rules to determine the optimal score. The output is a list of integers, each representing the maximum score for a test case, with the same number of elements as the number of test cases.**
