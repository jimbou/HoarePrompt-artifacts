Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, minus one test case.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been removed from the input because it was used to assign the value to `t`. Each remaining test case still contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3, which are the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
