Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is (1, 1, 4), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1 because it is not possible to achieve these scores with any set of games and results.

In this case, the program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, but it does not check if this is actually possible given the scores. A correct solution would need to check if the scores can be achieved with a valid set of games and results, and if not, output -1.
