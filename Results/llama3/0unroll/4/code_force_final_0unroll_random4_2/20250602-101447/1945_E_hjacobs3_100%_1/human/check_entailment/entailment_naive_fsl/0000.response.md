Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program only checks if l is equal to the index of the find element in the array, and if not, it swaps the elements at positions l and the index of the find element. This does not guarantee that p_l will be equal to x after the algorithm is executed.

For example, consider the input:

6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output:

0

However, the correct output should be:

1
3 4

Because the algorithm needs to swap the elements at positions 3 and 4 to make p_l equal to x.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
