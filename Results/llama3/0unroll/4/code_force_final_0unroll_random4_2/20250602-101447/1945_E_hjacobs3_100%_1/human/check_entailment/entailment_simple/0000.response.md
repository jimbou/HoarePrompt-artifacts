Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm on a permutation array, and it correctly handles the case where the target element is not in its correct position after the binary search.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation array, the target element, and the permutation array itself. It then calls the function `func_1` with the permutation array and the target element as arguments.

The function `func_1` performs the binary search on the permutation array. It maintains two pointers, `l` and `r`, which represent the range of the array that the target element could be in. It repeatedly calculates the midpoint of this range and checks if the element at the midpoint is less than or equal to the target element. If it is, it moves the `l` pointer to the midpoint; otherwise, it moves the `r` pointer to the midpoint. This process continues until `r - l` is 1.

After the binary search, the function checks if the index `l` is equal to the index of the target element in the array. If it is not, it means that the target element is not in its correct position, and the function prints 1, indicating that one swap operation is needed. It then returns a list containing the indices of the elements that need to be swapped, which are `l + 1` and the index of the target element in the array plus 1.

If `l` is equal to the index of the target element, it means that the target element is already in its correct position, and the function prints 0, indicating that no swap operations are needed.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm on a permutation array and correctly handles the case where the target element is not in its correct position after the binary search.

Correctness: **True**
