Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to find, plus 1, converted to a string. The second string is the index of find in the array, plus 1, converted to a string.**

Note: The value of `r` is not included in the return statement, so its value is not affected by the return statement. The number 1 is printed before the return statement, but it is not included in the return statement.
