Functionality: **This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of distinct integers to find the index of a target value. If the target value is found, it returns a list containing the index of the largest element less than or equal to the target value (plus 1) and the index of the target value (plus 1), both as strings. If the target value is not found, it prints 0 and does not return any value.**
