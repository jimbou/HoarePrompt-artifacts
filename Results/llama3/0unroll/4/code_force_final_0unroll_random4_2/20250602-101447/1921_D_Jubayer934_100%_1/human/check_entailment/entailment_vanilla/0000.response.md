Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i of length n to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The given program first sorts both arrays a_i and b_i. Then, it iterates over the sorted array a_i and calculates the absolute difference between each element of a_i and the corresponding element of b_i. If the absolute difference between an element of a_i and the last element of b_i is greater than the absolute difference between the element of a_i and the corresponding element of b_i, it updates the answer array with the absolute differences between the elements of a_i and the last elements of b_i.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D. It iterates over the sorted arrays, calculates the absolute differences, and updates the answer array accordingly. The use of the variable "temp" to keep track of the index where the absolute difference between an element of a_i and the last element of b_i is greater than the absolute difference between the element of a_i and the corresponding element of b_i is also correct.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The line "a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]" is unnecessary, as the input array a_i already has n elements. The correct line should be "a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))".

Also, the line "b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]" is also unnecessary, as the input array b_i already has m elements. The correct line should be "b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)".

Correctness: **True**
