Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of array b to be as different as possible from array a.

The program first sorts both arrays a and b. Then, it iterates over the elements of array a and for each element, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in array b. If the absolute difference with the mirrored element in array b is greater, it updates the answer array with this difference.

Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences in the answer array, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the arrays a and b have different lengths, and it also correctly calculates the absolute differences between the elements of the two arrays.

Correctness: **True**
