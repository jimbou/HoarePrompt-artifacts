Functionality: **For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each pair of elements from two sorted arrays, a and b, where the pairs are formed by either matching elements at the same index or matching elements at mirrored indices (i.e., the first element of a with the last element of b, the second element of a with the second last element of b, and so on), whichever results in a smaller absolute difference. The function then prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case.**
