Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference D between the two arrays. It first sorts both arrays, then iterates through the first array and for each element, it checks if the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the second array is greater than the absolute difference with the element at the same index in the second array. If it is, it updates the answer array with the maximum difference. If not, it simply appends the absolute difference with the element at the same index in the second array to the answer array.

The program also handles the case where the second array has more elements than the first array by only considering the first n elements of the second array.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
