Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the greedy algorithm to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by choosing n integers from the array b_i and arranging them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n.

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, and the arrays a_i and b_i.

2. It sorts the array a_i in ascending order and the array b_i in descending order. This is because we want to maximize the total difference D, so we want to pair the smallest elements of a_i with the largest elements of b_i, and the largest elements of a_i with the smallest elements of b_i.

3. It then iterates over the array a_i and for each element, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the array b_i. If the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the array b_i is greater than the absolute difference with the element at the current index in the array b_i, it updates the index and breaks the loop.

4. If the index is updated, it means that we need to pair the remaining elements of a_i with the remaining elements of b_i in reverse order to maximize the total difference D.

5. Finally, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
