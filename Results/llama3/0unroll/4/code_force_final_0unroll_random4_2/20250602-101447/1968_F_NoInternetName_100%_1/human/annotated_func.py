#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the list of space-separated values returned by the input() function, converting each string to a specific type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of space-separated values as input, splits it into individual strings, applies a specified casting function to each string, and returns a map object containing the converted values.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for the first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate function and returns its index if found, otherwise returns None.

    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to the list `arr` and the predicate function `predicate`. The predicate function takes one argument and returns a boolean value, and `func_2` applies this predicate to the elements of `arr`. The exact result depends on the implementation of `func_2`, but it will be based on the elements of `arr` and the boolean values returned by `predicate` for each element.

#Overall this is what the function does:Applies a predicate function to a list of elements and returns the result of the application, which depends on the implementation of the function `func_2`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`, which is a value that depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the values of `arr` and `predicate`. Additionally, `result` is `None`
    return None
    #The program returns None, which is the same as the initial value of `result` that depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the values of `arr` and `predicate`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input, applies the predicate function to the list using the `func_2` function, and returns the result of `func_2` plus 1 if it is not None, otherwise returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, and the function func_1 and func_4 are defined and return a list of integers and an index respectively.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed q iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the list x and dictionary inds remaining unchanged. The loop only prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions inside the loop, but does not modify the state of x and inds.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no parameters and returns no value. It performs the following actions: 

1. It generates two positive integers n and q, and a list a of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
2. It calculates the cumulative XOR of the elements in list a and stores the result in list x.
3. It creates a dictionary inds that maps each cumulative XOR value in list x to its indices.
4. It iterates q times, each time taking two integers l and r as input.
5. For each iteration, it checks if the cumulative XOR value at index l-1 is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index r. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'.
6. If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, it finds the largest index lower in inds[x[r]] that is less than l, and the smallest index upper in inds[x[l-1]] that is greater than or equal to r.
7. If upper is greater than lower, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
8. After q iterations, the function concludes without modifying the state of list x and dictionary inds.
