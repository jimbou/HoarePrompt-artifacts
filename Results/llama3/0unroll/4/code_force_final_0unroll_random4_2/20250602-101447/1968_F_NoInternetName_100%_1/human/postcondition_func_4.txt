This function takes no parameters and returns no value. It performs the following actions: 

1. It generates two positive integers n and q, and a list a of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
2. It calculates the cumulative XOR of the elements in list a and stores the result in list x.
3. It creates a dictionary inds that maps each cumulative XOR value in list x to its indices.
4. It iterates q times, each time taking two integers l and r as input.
5. For each iteration, it checks if the cumulative XOR value at index l-1 is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index r. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'.
6. If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, it finds the largest index lower in inds[x[r]] that is less than l, and the smallest index upper in inds[x[l-1]] that is greater than or equal to r.
7. If upper is greater than lower, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
8. After q iterations, the function concludes without modifying the state of list x and dictionary inds.
