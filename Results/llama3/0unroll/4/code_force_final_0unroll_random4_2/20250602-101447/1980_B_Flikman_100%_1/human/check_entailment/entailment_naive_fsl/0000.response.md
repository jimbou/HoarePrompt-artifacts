Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube has a value that is not unique in the list. In this case, the program only checks if the favorite value is among the first k values in the sorted list, but it does not consider the position of the favorite cube among the cubes with the same value.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES" because the favorite cube (with value 3) will always be among the first 2 cubes in the sorted list.

The program should be modified to consider the position of the favorite cube among the cubes with the same value. One possible solution is to count the number of cubes with a value greater than or equal to the favorite value and check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes in the sorted list.
