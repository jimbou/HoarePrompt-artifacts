The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. So after accepting the first integer, stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100). Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
