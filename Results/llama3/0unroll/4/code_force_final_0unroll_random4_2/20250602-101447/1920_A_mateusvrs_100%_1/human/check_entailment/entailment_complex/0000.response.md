Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It iterates over each test case and processes the constraints correctly. For each constraint, it updates the `bx` and `ax` variables accordingly, and adds the `x` value to the `cx` set if the constraint is of type 3.
3. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means that there are no integers that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` by subtracting the number of integers in `cx` that are within the range from the total number of integers in the range.
5. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there are no integers that satisfy all constraints, and when the range `[bx, ax]` is empty.

Correctness: **True**
