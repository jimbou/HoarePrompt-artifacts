Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of constraints (n) and the constraints themselves (a and x).
2.  It initializes the variables bx and ax to keep track of the maximum and minimum values of x for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also initializes a set cx to store the values of x for constraints of type 3.
3.  The program then iterates over each constraint. For constraints of type 1, it updates bx to be the maximum of bx and x. For constraints of type 2, it updates ax to be the minimum of ax and x. For constraints of type 3, it adds x to the set cx.
4.  After processing all constraints, the program checks if bx is greater than ax. If so, it means that there are no integers k that satisfy all constraints (since k cannot be both greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax), and it appends 0 to the result list.
5.  If bx is not greater than ax, the program calculates the number of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set cx. It does this by subtracting the number of elements in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of integers in the range (ax - bx + 1).
6.  Finally, the program prints the count of integers that satisfy all constraints for each test case, separated by newline characters.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
