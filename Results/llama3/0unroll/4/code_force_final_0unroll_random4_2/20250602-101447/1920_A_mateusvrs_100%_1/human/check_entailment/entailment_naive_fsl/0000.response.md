Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). It then iterates over the constraints, updating bx and ax accordingly and adding values to cx. Finally, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where bx > ax, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x), by adding all such values to the set cx and then subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
