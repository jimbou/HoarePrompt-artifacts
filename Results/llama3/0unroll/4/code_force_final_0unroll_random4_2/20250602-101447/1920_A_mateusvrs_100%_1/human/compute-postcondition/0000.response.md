Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. This value represents the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin remains unchanged, as the code does not consume any input from stdin.
