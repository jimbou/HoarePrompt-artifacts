The `print` statement is printing the elements of the list `r` separated by newline characters (`\n`). The list `r` contains the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` for each test case.

Since `t` is an integer equal to 0, it is not directly involved in the printing process.

The output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` for a specific test case. The numbers will be separated by newline characters.

Output: **A sequence of numbers, each representing the count of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in cx for a specific test case, separated by newline characters.**
