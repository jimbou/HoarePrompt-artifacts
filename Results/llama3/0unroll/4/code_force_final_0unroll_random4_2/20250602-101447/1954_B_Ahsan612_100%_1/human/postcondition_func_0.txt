This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output to standard output. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. The function then analyzes each test case to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of a number in the list. If such a number exists, it prints the minimum count; otherwise, it prints -1. The output is presented in the same order as the input test cases.
