Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the number of consecutive occurrences of each number. It maintains a variable `minn` to store the minimum number of consecutive occurrences seen so far. If the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the length of the array or is infinity (meaning no changes were found), the program prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the `minn` variable to keep track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is a good approach, and the program's handling of the edge cases (where the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the length of the array or is infinity) is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
