Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of a number. If the minimum number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the length of the array or infinity (indicating that all elements are the same), it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles the edge cases where the array has only one element or all elements are the same.

Correctness: **True**
