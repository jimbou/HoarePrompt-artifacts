Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the input array, keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of a number. If the minimum count is infinity or equal to the length of the array, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. The use of the `inf` variable from the math module ensures that the minimum count is initialized with a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible count. The program also correctly updates the minimum count when it encounters a new number in the array.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
