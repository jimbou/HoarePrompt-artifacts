Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.

3. It initializes variables to keep track of the count of the same elements and the minimum count found so far.

4. It then iterates over the array, counting the occurrences of the same elements. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count if necessary and resets the count for the new element.

5. After iterating over the entire array, it updates the minimum count one last time.

6. Finally, it checks if the minimum count is equal to the length of the array or if it's still infinity (which means all elements in the array are the same). If either condition is true, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. 

Correctness: **True**
