To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(len(ansv))` executes, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. `x` is 0: This variable's value is explicitly given but does not directly influence the output of the print statement.
2. `subseq_lens` is a list of integers: The exact integers are not specified, but we know it's a list of integers.
3. `mx` is an integer: The value of `mx` is not specified, but it's used to define the initial part of `ansv`.
4. `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all integers from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1: This means `ansv` is composed of two parts. The first part is a sequence of integers from 0 up to but not including `mx`. The second part is the list `subseq_lens` but starting from its second element (index 1), implying the first element of `subseq_lens` is skipped.

Given this, `len(ansv)` will be the sum of two lengths:
- The length of the sequence from 0 to `mx-1`, which is `mx`.
- The length of `subseq_lens` minus 1 (since the first element is skipped).

However, without explicit values for `mx` and the length of `subseq_lens`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `len(ansv)`. But we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **mx + (length of subseq_lens - 1)**
