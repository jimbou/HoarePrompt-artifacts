Functionality: **This function reads an integer and a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to generate a new list of integers, and prints the length and elements of the new list to the console. If the input integer is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without further processing. Otherwise, it generates the new list by finding the maximum length of subsequences in the input list and appending the lengths of the subsequences to the new list. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console.**
