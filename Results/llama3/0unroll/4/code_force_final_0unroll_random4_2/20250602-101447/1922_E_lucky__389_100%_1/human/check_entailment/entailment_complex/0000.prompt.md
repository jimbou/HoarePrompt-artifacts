Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the test cases). Each test case is a positive integer.
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged: x is 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, and stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers. Additionally, the numbers 1 and 0 have been printed.
    #State: x is an integer, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and x is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is an integer, and stdin is empty.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all integers from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (length of subseq_lens - 1)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The length of `ansv` has been printed, and all the elements of `ansv` have been printed to the console, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline character

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer and a list of integers from standard input, processes the list to generate a new list of integers, and prints the length and elements of the new list to the console. If the input integer is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without further processing. Otherwise, it generates the new list by finding the maximum length of subsequences in the input list and appending the lengths of the subsequences to the new list. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console.
