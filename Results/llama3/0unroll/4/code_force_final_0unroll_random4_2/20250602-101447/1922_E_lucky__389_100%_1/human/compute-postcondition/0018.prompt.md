You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the test cases). Each test case is a positive integer.
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged: x is 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, and stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers. Additionally, the numbers 1 and 0 have been printed.
    #State: x is an integer, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and x is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is an integer, and stdin is empty.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all integers from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (length of subseq_lens - 1)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The length of `ansv` has been printed, and all the elements of `ansv` have been printed to the console, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline character

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged: x is 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, and stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers. Additionally, the numbers 1 and 0 have been printed.

Case_2: Output State: The length of `ansv` has been printed, and all the elements of `ansv` have been printed to the console, separated by spaces.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
