Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is an integer, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of x has been reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop. The list subseq_lens contains the lengths of the subsequences that were removed from x during each iteration. The variable mx holds the maximum length of these subsequences. The stdin is empty because all inputs have been processed.
