Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks for the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This means we need to find the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers can be zero.

2. The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of ones in the binary representation of each number is even. This is because XOR is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

3. The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the input integers by 2, which gives the number of pairs of each number that can be formed. This is because the integer division of a number by 2 gives the number of pairs that can be formed from that number.

4. The program then adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of three of the integer divisions by 2 equals 3. This is because if the sum of the remainders is 3, it means that there is one number left that is not paired, and this number can be removed by Eve to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.

5. The program repeats this calculation for each line of input, which means it calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

6. The program prints the results to standard output, which means it provides the correct output for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
