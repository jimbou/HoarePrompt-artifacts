Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks two conditions:

1. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO' because `c` matches the template.
2. If any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES' because a template can be created where the characters in `c` that are not present in both `a` and `b` are uppercase, and the remaining characters are lowercase.

If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO' because no template can be created that satisfies the conditions.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It checks all possible conditions and prints the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
