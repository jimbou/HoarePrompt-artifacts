Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c.

The program first checks if string c is equal to either string a or string b. If it is, the program prints 'NO' because the condition for the template t is not met.

If string c is not equal to either string a or string b, the program then checks if any character in string c is not present in both strings a and b. If such a character is found, the program prints 'YES' because a template t can be created that matches strings a and b but not string c.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NO' because no template t can be created that meets the given conditions.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
