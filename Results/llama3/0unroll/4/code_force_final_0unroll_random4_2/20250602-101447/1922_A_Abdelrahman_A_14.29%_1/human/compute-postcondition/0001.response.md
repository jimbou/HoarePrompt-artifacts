Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, if string 'c' is equal to either 'a' or 'b', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if any character in 'c' is not present in both 'a' and 'b', 'YES' is printed. If neither condition is met, 'NO' is printed. The value of 'tests' remains unchanged.**
