Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c. It then checks each test case and prints 'YES' to the console if string c contains a character not present in both strings a and b, or if string c is equal to either string a or string b, it prints 'NO'. If neither condition is met, it also prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value, only printing the results to the console.**
