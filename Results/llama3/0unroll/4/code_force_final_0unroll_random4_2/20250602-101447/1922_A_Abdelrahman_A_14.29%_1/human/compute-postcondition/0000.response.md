The code `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. This means that the first input is an integer, which is read by the code and assigned to `tests`. 

After the code is executed, the value of `tests` is the integer t, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin is the t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
