Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer because it is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The other test cases remain in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.
