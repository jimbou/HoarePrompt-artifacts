This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates and prints the minimum of the sum of the first two scores and half of the total sum of the three scores for each test case. If the total sum of the three scores is odd, it prints -1 instead. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.
