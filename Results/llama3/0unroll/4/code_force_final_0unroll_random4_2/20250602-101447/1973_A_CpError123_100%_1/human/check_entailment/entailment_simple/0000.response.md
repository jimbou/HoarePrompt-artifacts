Reasoning:

The program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first checks if the total sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and moves on to the next test case. This is correct because the total sum of the scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total sum.

2.  If the total sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. This is done by calculating the minimum of two values: the sum of the first two scores (a + b) and half of the total sum of the scores ((a + b + c) // 2).

    *   The sum of the first two scores (a + b) represents the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred between the first two players. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to each player's score, so the sum of their scores represents the maximum possible number of draws between them.

    *   Half of the total sum of the scores ((a + b + c) // 2) represents the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred in total. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to each player's score, so half of the total sum of the scores represents the maximum possible number of draws.

    *   The program takes the minimum of these two values because the actual number of draws that occurred cannot exceed either of these values.

3.  The program prints the minimum of these two values for each test case. This represents the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred.

Correctness: **True**
