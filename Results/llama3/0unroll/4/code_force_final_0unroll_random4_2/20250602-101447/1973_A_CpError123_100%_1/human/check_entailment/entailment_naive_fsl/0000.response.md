Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the total number of points is not a multiple of 2. In this case, the program will print -1, but it should print the maximum possible number of draws instead.

For example, if the input is 1 1 10, the program will print -1, but the correct output should be 2. This is because the maximum possible number of draws is 2, which can be achieved by having one game between the first and second player, and one game between the second and third player, both ending in draws.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle this case correctly. It only checks if the total number of points is a multiple of 2, but it does not consider the case when the total number of points is not a multiple of 2.
