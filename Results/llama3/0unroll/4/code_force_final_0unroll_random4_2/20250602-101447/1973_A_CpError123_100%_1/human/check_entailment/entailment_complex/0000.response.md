Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be non-decreasing.

The program first checks if the total sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid set of games that could have resulted in the given scores. This is because the total sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point for each player).

If the total sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the minimum of the sum of the first two scores and half of the total sum of the three scores. This minimum value represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the constraints of the problem, such as the non-decreasing order of the scores and the even total sum of the scores. The program also correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
