Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the total sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints -1 because the total sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum, and a draw contributes 2 points as well). This is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.

2. If the total sum is even, it calculates the minimum of two values: `x` and `y`. `x` is half of the total sum of the scores, which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened (since each draw contributes 1 point to each player's score). `y` is the sum of the first two scores, which represents the maximum number of points that the first two players could have scored together.

3. The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the constraints of the problem, such as the fact that the total sum of the scores must be even, and that the first two players' scores cannot exceed the total sum of the scores.

Correctness: **True**
