Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
