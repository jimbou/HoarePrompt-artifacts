Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from standard input, representing the size of a matrix, and prints the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers and twice the value of n. It then iterates n times, printing the values of i and the range from n to 1 in reverse order, twice for each iteration. The function does not return any value, only producing output to the console.**
