The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. 

Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6` and the expression `2 * n` calculates twice the value of `n`.

Output: **the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, twice the value of n (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
