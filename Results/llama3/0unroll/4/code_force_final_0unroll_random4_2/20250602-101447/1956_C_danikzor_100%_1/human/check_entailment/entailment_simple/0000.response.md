Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program takes the number of test cases and the size of the matrix as input, and then calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program uses the formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers to calculate the maximum sum, which is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is correct and is used to calculate the maximum sum for each test case.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is `2 * n`. This is also correct, as the program performs two operations for each row and column of the matrix.

The program then uses two nested loops to print the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The outer loop iterates over each row and column of the matrix, and the inner loop prints the operation type, row or column number, and the permutation used in the operation.

The permutation used in the operation is printed in reverse order, which is correct. This is because the problem statement requires the permutation to be in arbitrary order, and printing it in reverse order is a valid permutation.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
