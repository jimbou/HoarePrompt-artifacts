Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the product of `n`, `n+1`, and `4*n-1` divided by 6, and 2 times `n` have been printed to the console, and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The loop has iterated `n` times, printing the values of `i` and the range from `n` to 1 in reverse order, twice for each iteration.**
