Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description asks to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix by performing operations of two types. However, the program only performs operations of type 1 and type 2 in a fixed order, without considering the optimal order of operations to maximize the sum.

For example, if the input is n = 3, the program will output:

9 6
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 2 3 1
2 2 2 3 1
1 3 1 2 3
2 3 1 2 3

However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to perform the operations in a different order, such as:

1 1 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
1 2 2 3 1
2 2 2 3 1
1 3 3 1 2
2 3 3 1 2

This solution has a higher sum of 15, whereas the program's solution has a sum of 9.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always find the optimal solution to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix.
