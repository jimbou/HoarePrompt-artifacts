Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
2. For each test case, the program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. This is correct because the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to `n` in a specific order.
3. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`. This is correct because the program performs `2 * n` operations to fill the matrix.
4. The program then iterates `n` times, printing the values of `i` and the range from `n` to 1 in reverse order, twice for each iteration. This is correct because the program is simulating the operations to fill the matrix. The first print statement simulates a Type 1 operation, and the second print statement simulates a Type 2 operation.
5. The program does not return any value, only producing output to the console. This is correct because the problem statement does not require the program to return any value.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and simulating the operations to achieve that sum.

Correctness: **True**
