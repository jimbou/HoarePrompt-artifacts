Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix, which is the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, and prints the correct number of operations, which is twice the value of n. The program then prints the correct operations to achieve this maximum sum, which is to set each row and column to the permutation of numbers from n to 1 in reverse order.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required operations to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. The use of the formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is also correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
