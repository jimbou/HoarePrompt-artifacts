Output State: **`a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a binary string a of length n. The second line contains a binary string b of length m.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now consists of two lines instead of three, since the first line has been read and assigned to `a`. The first line of each test case now contains a binary string `a` of length `n`, and the second line contains a binary string `b` of length `m`.
