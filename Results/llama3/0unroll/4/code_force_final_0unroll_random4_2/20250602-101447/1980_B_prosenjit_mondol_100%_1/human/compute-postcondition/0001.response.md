Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers. It then determines whether the f-th integer in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the k-th integer in the sorted list. Based on this comparison, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' to the console for each test case, indicating whether the f-th integer is greater than, less than, or equal to the k-th integer, respectively. If the f-th integer is equal to the k-th integer, it prints 'YES' if the k-th integer is the largest integer in the list, and 'MAYBE' otherwise.**
