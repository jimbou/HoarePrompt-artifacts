Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the favorite cube is at the k-th position after sorting, and there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are also at or above the k-th position. In this case, the program should print "MAYBE", but it prints "YES" instead.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The favorite cube is at the 2nd position, and there are two other cubes with the same value (3) that are also at or above the 2nd position. In this case, the program should print "MAYBE", but it prints "YES" instead.

To fix this issue, the program should check if there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are also at or above the k-th position, and print "MAYBE" if there are.
