Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program uses the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to check if Bob can make all parts have the same color. This condition checks if the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint (`n <= k`), or if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint (`n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`).

If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Bob can make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is 1, `m` is 1, or `k` is equal to `n`. It also correctly handles the case when `m` is greater than `n`, in which case Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
