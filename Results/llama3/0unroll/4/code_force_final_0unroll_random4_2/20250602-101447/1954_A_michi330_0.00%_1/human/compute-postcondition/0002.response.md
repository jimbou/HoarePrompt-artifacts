Functionality: **Determines whether a given set of conditions is met for a series of test cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function takes no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly to the output. It processes a variable number of test cases, each defined by three integers (n, m, k), and evaluates whether the conditions n > k and n - ceil(n/m) >= k are both true. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values and does not retain any state between test cases.**
