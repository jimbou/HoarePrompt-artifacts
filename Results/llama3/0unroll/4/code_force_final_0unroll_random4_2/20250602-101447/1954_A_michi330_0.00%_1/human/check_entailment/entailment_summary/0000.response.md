Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem statement asks to determine if it's possible to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program checks two conditions:

1. `n > k`: This ensures that the total number of parts is more than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is not met, Bob can simply repaint all parts to make them the same color.

2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color is greater than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is met, it means that even if Bob repaints all the parts that are not painted with the most frequent color, there will still be parts left that are not the same color.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or `m` is 1, and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
