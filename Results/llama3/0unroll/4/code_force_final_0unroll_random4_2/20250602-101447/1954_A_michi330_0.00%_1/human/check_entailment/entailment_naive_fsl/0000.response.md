Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program first checks if the number of parts (n) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint (k). If this condition is true, it means that Bob can repaint all parts to have the same color, so the program prints "NO".

The program then checks if the number of parts minus the ceiling of the number of parts divided by the number of colors (m) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint (k). If this condition is true, it means that Bob can repaint the remaining parts to have the same color, so the program prints "NO".

If neither of these conditions is true, it means that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the program prints "YES".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = 1, m = 1, or k = 1. It also correctly handles cases where n > k and m > 1.

Therefore, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic to solve the problem.
