Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines each containing three integers n, m and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, containing t lines each with three integers n, m, and k, where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50.
