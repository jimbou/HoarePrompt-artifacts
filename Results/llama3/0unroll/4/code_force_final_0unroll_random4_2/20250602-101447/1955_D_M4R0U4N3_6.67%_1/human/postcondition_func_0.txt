This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain n and m integers, respectively. It then calculates and prints the number of subarrays of length m that contain at least k elements from the set of integers in the third line. The function iterates over the integers in the second line, maintaining a set of done and extra elements, and updates the count of subarrays that meet the condition as it processes the integers. Finally, it outputs the total count of such subarrays.
