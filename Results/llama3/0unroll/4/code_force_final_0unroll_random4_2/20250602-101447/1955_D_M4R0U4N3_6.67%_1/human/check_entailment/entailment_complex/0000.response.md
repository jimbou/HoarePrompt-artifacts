Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the number of subarrays of length m that contain at least k elements from the set todo.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It correctly maintains the sets todo, done, and extra to keep track of the elements that need to be matched, the elements that have been matched, and the extra elements that are not in the set todo.
3. The program correctly updates the sets and the count of subarrays that meet the condition as it processes the integers in the second line.
4. The program correctly outputs the total count of subarrays that meet the condition.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
