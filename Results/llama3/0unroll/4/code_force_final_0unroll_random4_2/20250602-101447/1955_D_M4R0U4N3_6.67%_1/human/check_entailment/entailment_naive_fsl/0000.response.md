Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array a. It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of matching elements between array a and array b. The program correctly handles the cases where the elements of array a are not unique and where the elements of array b are not unique.

The program first initializes the sets todo, done, and extra to keep track of the elements of array b that need to be matched, the elements of array b that have been matched, and the extra elements of array a that are not in array b, respectively. It then iterates over the first m elements of array a to initialize the sets.

The program then iterates over the rest of array a, updating the sets and the count of good subsegments as it goes. It correctly handles the cases where an element of array a is removed from the window and where an element of array a is added to the window.

The program finally prints the count of good subsegments.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
