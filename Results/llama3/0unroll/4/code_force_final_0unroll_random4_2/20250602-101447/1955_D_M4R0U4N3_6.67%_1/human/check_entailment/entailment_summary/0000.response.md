Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the number of subarrays of length m that contain at least k elements from the set of integers in the third line. 

The program uses a sliding window approach, maintaining a set of done and extra elements as it processes the integers in the second line. It updates the count of subarrays that meet the condition as it processes the integers. 

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the length of the done set is less than k, and when the length of the done set is greater than or equal to k. 

The program also correctly handles the case when the length of the extra set is greater than 0, which means that there are extra elements in the current window that are not in the set of integers in the third line. 

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the second line, which is efficient for the given problem. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
