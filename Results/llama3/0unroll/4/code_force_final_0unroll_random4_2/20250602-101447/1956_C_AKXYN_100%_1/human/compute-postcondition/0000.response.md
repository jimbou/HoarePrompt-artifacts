Output State: **The output state will contain the results of the loop's execution for each test case. For each test case, it will print the value of 'res' and 'n << 1', followed by 'n' lines of output, each containing the numbers from 1 to 'n' in ascending order, and then 'n' lines of output, each containing the numbers from 1 to 'n' in descending order.**
