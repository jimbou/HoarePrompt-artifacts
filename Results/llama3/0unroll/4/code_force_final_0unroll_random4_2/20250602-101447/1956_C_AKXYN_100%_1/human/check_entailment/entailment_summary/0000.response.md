Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer `n` representing the size of a matrix.
2.  For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that maximizes their contribution to the sum.
3.  The program then prints the calculated maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1`, which is within the allowed limit of `2n` operations.
4.  Finally, the program prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. It does this by printing `n` lines of output containing numbers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, followed by `n` lines of output containing numbers from 1 to `n` in descending order. This corresponds to the Type 1 and Type 2 operations described in the problem statement.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.
