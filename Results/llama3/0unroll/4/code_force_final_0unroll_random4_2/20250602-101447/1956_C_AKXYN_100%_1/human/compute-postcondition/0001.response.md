Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates a result 'res' based on the formula res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to n-1, and then prints the value of 'res' and 'n << 1'. Additionally, it prints 'n' lines of output containing numbers from 1 to 'n' in ascending order, followed by 'n' lines of output containing numbers from 1 to 'n' in descending order.**
