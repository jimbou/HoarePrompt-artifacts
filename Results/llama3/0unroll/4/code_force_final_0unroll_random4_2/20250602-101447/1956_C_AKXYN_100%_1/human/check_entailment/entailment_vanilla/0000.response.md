Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation, which assigns a permutation to a row, and Type 2 operation, which assigns a permutation to a column.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

3. It then creates an `n x n` matrix `mat` filled with numbers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.

4. The program calculates the maximum sum of all numbers in the matrix by using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, and the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6`.

5. The program then prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is equivalent to `2 * n`).

6. Finally, the program prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum. For each row and column from `n` to 1, it prints a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation with the permutation from 1 to `n`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the maximum sum for each test case. However, the problem statement requires the program to output the operations in a specific format, which the program does not follow exactly. The program prints the operations in the format "1 i p1 p2 ... pn" and "2 i p1 p2 ... pn", but the problem statement requires the format "c i p1 p2 ... pn" where c is the type of operation.

Despite this minor issue with the output format, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct maximum sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
