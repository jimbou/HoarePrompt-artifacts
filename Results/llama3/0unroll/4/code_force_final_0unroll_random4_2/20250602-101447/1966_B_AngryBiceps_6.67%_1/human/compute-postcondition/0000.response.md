Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to a test case. The output is 'YES' if the first row is the same as the last row or if the first column is the same as the last column, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings is equal to the number of test cases, which is given by the integer t in the initial state.**
