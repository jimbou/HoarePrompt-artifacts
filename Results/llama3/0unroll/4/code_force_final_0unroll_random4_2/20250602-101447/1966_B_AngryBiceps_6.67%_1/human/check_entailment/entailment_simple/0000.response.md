Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking if the first row is the same as the last row or if the first column is the same as the last column. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just one. Therefore, it is possible to make all squares the same color even if the first row is not the same as the last row or the first column is not the same as the last column.

For example, consider the following grid:

WB
BW

The first row is not the same as the last row, and the first column is not the same as the last column. However, it is still possible to make all squares the same color by performing two operations: first, select the top-left and bottom-right squares and color all squares in between white, and then select the top-right and bottom-left squares and color all squares in between white.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
