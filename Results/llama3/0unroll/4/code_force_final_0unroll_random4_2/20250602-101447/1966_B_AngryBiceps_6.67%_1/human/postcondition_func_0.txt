This function reads input from standard input, processes it as a series of test cases, and outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, containing only 'W' and 'B'. The function checks if the first row is the same as the last row or if the first column is the same as the last column. If either condition is true, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The number of output strings corresponds to the number of test cases provided in the input.
