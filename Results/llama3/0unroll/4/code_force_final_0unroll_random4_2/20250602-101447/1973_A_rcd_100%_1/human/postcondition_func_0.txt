This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three sorted integers representing player scores. It calculates and prints the result for each test case, which can be -1 if the sum of scores is odd, the sum of the first two scores if the third score is greater than or equal to their sum, or the result of a specific iterative calculation if the third score is less than the sum of the first two scores. The function does not return any value but prints the results for all test cases.
