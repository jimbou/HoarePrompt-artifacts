Output State: **The output state will contain the results of the loop's executions, which are the number of test cases that were processed. For each test case, the output will be either -1 (if the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd), the sum of p1 and p2 (if p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2), or the result of the while loop (if p3 is less than the sum of p1 and p2). The output state will not contain the values of t, p1, p2, or p3, as they are only used within the loop and do not affect the overall state of the program.**
