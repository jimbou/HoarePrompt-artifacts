Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when p1 = 1, p2 = 1, and p3 = 10. The program prints 2, but the correct answer is 2.

The issue is in the line `if p3 >= p1 + p2: print(p1 + p2)`. This line assumes that if p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, then the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2. However, this is not always the case.

For example, when p1 = 1, p2 = 1, and p3 = 10, the program prints 2, but the correct answer is 2. This is because p3 can be achieved by having 5 wins and 0 draws, which is not the maximum number of draws.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to add an additional check to see if p3 can be achieved by having wins and draws, and if so, calculate the maximum number of draws accordingly.
