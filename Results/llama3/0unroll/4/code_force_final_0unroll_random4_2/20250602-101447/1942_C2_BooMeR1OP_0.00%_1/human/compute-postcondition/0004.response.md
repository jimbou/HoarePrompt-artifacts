Output State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to the number of pairs of adjacent integers in the list a that have a difference of 1 modulo n, where the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present, gaps is a list of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a, where each gap is calculated as the difference between the next element and the current element minus 1, and the next element is the next element in the list a, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary.
