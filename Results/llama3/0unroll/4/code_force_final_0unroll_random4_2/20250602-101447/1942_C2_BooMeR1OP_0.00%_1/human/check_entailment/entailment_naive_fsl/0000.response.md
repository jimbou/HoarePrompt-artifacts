Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie, and then tries to add more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of vertices chosen by Bessie is less than or equal to the number of vertices that can be added. It also correctly handles the case where the number of vertices chosen by Bessie is greater than the number of vertices that can be added.

The program uses a greedy approach to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles. It first adds vertices that can form triangles with the vertices chosen by Bessie, and then adds vertices that can form triangles with the vertices that have already been added.

The program correctly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the added vertices, and adds this number to the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out, and handles all possible cases correctly.
