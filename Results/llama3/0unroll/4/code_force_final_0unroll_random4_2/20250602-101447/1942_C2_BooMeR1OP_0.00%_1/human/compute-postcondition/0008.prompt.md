Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable gaps is a sorted list of x integers, where each integer represents the difference between two adjacent integers in the list a, minus 1, and the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present. The variable ans remains unchanged, equal to the number of pairs of adjacent integers in the list a that have a difference of 1 modulo n, where the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
