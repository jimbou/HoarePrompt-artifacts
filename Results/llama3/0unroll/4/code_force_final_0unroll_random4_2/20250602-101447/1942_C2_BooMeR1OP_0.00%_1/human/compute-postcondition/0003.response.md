Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to the number of pairs of adjacent integers in the list a that have a difference of 1 modulo n, where the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present, gaps is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `gaps` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
