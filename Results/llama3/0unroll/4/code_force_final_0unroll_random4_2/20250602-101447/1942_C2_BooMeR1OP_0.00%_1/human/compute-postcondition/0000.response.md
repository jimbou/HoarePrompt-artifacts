Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of the final state:

*   `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and their values are determined by the input.
*   `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`. The list is sorted in ascending order.
*   `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`. The set contains the same elements as the list `a`.
*   `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2`. This value is calculated based on the value of `x`.
*   Stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The first test case has been processed, and the remaining test cases are still in the input buffer.
