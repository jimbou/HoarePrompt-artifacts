Output State: The variable gaps is a list of x integers, where each integer represents the difference between two adjacent integers in the list a, minus 1, and the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present. The variable ans remains unchanged, equal to the number of pairs of adjacent integers in the list a that have a difference of 1 modulo n, where the first integer of the pair is not in the set present and the second integer is in the set present.
