Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program first checks if all the numbers in the sequence have the same parity (i.e., all odd or all even). If they do, it increments the count by 1, because in this case, Bob can win when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

Then, for each number in the sequence, the program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by dividing the number by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer. This is because if a number can be divided by 2, Bob can win by removing one of the numbers that contribute to the XOR result.

The program correctly calculates the total count of numbers that are either odd or can be divided by 2 for each set and prints the counts.

Correctness: **True**
