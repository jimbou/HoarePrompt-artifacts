Output State: **The output state is the maximum possible sum of the array elements after applying the given operations for each test case. The operations involve subtracting twice the value of the first x elements and then adding the value of the first k elements and subtracting twice the value of the elements at index k+x, if it exists. The maximum sum is calculated and printed for each test case. The input state remains unchanged, with t test cases still in stdin, each consisting of two lines with the same format as the initial state.**
