Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers (n, k, and x) and the second line contains n integers. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after applying specific operations (subtracting twice the value of the first x elements, adding the value of the first k elements, and subtracting twice the value of elements at index k+x if it exists) and prints this maximum sum for each test case. The input state remains unchanged.**
