This function reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` strings consisting of characters 0 and 1. It then calculates the number of alternating sequences of 0s and 1s in each string and prints the result for each string. If a string consists of only one type of character (either 0 or 1), it prints the length of the string plus one. Otherwise, it prints the number of alternating sequences. The function outputs a series of integers, each representing the number of alternating sequences in the corresponding input string, with the number of integers equal to the value of `t`.
