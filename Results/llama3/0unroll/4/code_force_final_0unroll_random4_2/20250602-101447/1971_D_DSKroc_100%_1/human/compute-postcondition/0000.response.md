The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` strings first. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` strings, each string consists of characters 0 and 1 and has a length between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` strings, each string consists of characters 0 and 1 and has a length between 1 and 500 inclusive.**
