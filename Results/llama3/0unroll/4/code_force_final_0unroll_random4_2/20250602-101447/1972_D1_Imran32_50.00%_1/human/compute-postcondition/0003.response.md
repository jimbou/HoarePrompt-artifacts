The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer, the square root of `n` plus 1 is also a positive integer. The sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1 is a sum of integer divisions, where each term is divided by the square of `i`.

The value of `ans` is therefore a positive integer, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of these integer divisions.

Output: **n + sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 2 to the square root of n plus 1**
