Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b), where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m. However, the program calculates the sum of the number of factors for a given positive integer n, which is not related to the problem.

The program seems to be a solution to a different problem, possibly related to counting the number of factors of a number. It does not take into account the value of m, which is a crucial part of the problem. Additionally, the program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b, which is also a key part of the problem.

Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
