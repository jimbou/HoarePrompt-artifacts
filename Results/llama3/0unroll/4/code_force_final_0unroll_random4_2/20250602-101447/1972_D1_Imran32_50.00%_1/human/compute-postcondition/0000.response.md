The first line reads two positive integers, `n` and `k`, from the first test case in stdin and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The third line calculates the square root of `n`, adds 1 to it, and assigns the result to the variable `root`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
