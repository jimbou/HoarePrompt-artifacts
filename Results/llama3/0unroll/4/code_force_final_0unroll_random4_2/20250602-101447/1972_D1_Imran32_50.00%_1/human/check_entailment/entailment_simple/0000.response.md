Reasoning:

The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

The given program calculates the number of pairs (a, b) where a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) for a given n and m.

However, the program does not take into account the value of m. It only uses the value of n to calculate the answer. This is incorrect because the problem statement clearly mentions that 1\le b\le m.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
