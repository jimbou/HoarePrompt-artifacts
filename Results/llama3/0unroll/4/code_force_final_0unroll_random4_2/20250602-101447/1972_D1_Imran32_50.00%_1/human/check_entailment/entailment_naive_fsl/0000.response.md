Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of `n` and the number of multiples of `i * i` in the range `[2, sqrt(n) + 1]`, which is not related to the problem.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if the conditions are satisfied. The program does not do this and instead uses a formula that is not relevant to the problem.

For example, if we input `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4` because the pairs `(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)` satisfy the conditions.
