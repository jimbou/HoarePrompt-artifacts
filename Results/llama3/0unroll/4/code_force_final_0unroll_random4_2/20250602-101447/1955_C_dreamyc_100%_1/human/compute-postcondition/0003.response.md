Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k/2, b is the floor of k/2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0.**

The code initializes new variables a, b, ans, s_a, and s_b, and assigns them specific values based on the initial state. The values of n, k, and nums remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
