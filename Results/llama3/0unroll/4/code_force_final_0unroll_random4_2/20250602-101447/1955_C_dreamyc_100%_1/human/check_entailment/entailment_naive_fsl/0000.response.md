Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the Kraken's attacks are not enough to sink all ships, but still manage to sink some ships. The program only checks if the total durability of the ships is less than or equal to the number of attacks, and if so, returns the total number of ships. However, this is not accurate, as the Kraken's attacks are not evenly distributed among the ships.

For example, consider the case where n=3, k=4, and a=[2, 2, 2]. The Kraken's attacks will sink the first and last ships, but the program will return 3, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to simulate the Kraken's attacks and keep track of the ships that are sunk. The program should also handle the case where the Kraken's attacks are not enough to sink all ships, but still manage to sink some ships.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if ships:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
                sunk += 1
        if ships:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk += 1
    return sunk
```
This program simulates the Kraken's attacks and keeps track of the ships that are sunk. It correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attacks are not enough to sink all ships, but still manage to sink some ships.
