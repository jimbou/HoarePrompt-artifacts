Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum number of integers that can be selected from a list of positive integers, such that the sum of the selected integers does not exceed a given target value k. If the sum of all integers in the list is less than or equal to k, it returns the total number of integers in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of integers that can be selected from the list by comparing the sum of integers from the start and end of the list with the ceiling and floor of k/2, respectively. The function returns this maximum number of integers.**
