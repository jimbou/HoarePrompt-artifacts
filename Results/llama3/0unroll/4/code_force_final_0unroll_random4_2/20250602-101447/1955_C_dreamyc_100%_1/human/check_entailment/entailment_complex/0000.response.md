Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of ships that were sunk after the Kraken's attack. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum number of ships that can be sunk based on the given number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of each ship `nums`.

The program first checks if the total durability of all ships is less than or equal to the number of attacks. If this condition is true, it means that all ships can be sunk, and the program returns `n`, which is the total number of ships.

If the total durability of all ships is greater than the number of attacks, the program calculates the maximum number of ships that can be sunk by comparing the sum of durability from the start and end of the list with the ceiling and floor of `k/2`, respectively. The program uses two variables `s_a` and `s_b` to keep track of the sum of durability from the start and end of the list, respectively. It also uses a variable `ans` to keep track of the maximum number of ships that can be sunk.

The program iterates through the list of durability `nums` and updates `s_a` and `s_b` accordingly. If `s_a` is less than or equal to the ceiling of `k/2`, it means that the ships from the start of the list can be sunk, and the program increments `ans` by 1. Similarly, if `s_b` is less than or equal to the floor of `k/2`, it means that the ships from the end of the list can be sunk, and the program increments `ans` by 1.

Finally, the program returns `ans`, which is the maximum number of ships that can be sunk.

Correctness: **True**
