Output State: **The final output state is the number of ways to place the remaining m dominoes in the grid after considering the constraints imposed by the k pairs of integers r_i and c_i.**

In this output state, the value of t is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of n, k, and the pairs of integers r_i and c_i are no longer relevant, as they have been used to calculate the final output for each test case. The variable num has been used to keep track of the number of dominoes that can be placed in the grid without violating the constraints, and the variable m represents the remaining number of dominoes to be placed. The dp array has been used to store the number of ways to place the remaining dominoes in the grid, and the final output is the value of dp[m].
