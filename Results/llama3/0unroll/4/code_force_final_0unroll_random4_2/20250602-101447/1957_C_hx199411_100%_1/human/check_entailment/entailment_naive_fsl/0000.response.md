Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the k moves and their mirrored moves, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible ways to place the remaining rooks. The base cases are handled correctly, and the recurrence relation is also correct. The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
