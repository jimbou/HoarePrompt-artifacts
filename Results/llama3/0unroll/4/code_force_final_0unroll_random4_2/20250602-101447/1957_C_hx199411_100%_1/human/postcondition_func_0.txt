This function calculates the number of ways to place dominoes in a grid after considering constraints imposed by given pairs of integers. It takes as input the number of test cases, followed by the size of the grid and the number of constraints for each test case. The function then outputs the number of ways to place the remaining dominoes in the grid for each test case, considering the constraints.
