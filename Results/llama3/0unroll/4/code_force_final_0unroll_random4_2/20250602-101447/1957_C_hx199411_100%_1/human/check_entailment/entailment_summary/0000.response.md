Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks on the chessboard, considering the constraints imposed by the given pairs of integers.

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, and then calculates the number of remaining rows and columns (m) that are available for placing new rooks. If m is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration, so the program prints 1. Otherwise, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible ways to place the remaining rooks, taking into account the constraints imposed by the given pairs of integers. The program also correctly handles the case where m is 0 or 1, and it correctly calculates the number of ways to place the remaining rooks for larger values of m.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
