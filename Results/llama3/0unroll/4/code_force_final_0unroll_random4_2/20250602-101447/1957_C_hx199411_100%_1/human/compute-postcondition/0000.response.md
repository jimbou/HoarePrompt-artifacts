Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The rest of the input remains unchanged, containing `t` test cases. Each test case still consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n).
