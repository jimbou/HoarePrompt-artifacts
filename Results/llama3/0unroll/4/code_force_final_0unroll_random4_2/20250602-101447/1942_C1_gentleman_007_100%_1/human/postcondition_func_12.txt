Functionality: This function takes a positive integer as input and returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of the input number and their respective counts. If the input number is a prime number, it will be included in the dictionary with a count of 1. The function reduces the input number to 1 by iteratively dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2, and updates the dictionary accordingly.
