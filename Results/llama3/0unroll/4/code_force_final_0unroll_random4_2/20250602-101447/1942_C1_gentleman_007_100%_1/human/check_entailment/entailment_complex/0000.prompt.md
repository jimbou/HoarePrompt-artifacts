# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n+1 lists, where each inner list at index x and y is populated with values returned by func_1() for m iterations. The function takes a positive integer n and a non-negative integer m as input, where 0 <= m <= n, and returns the populated list of lists.

    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the non-negative integer x.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-negative integer x as input and returns the number of trailing zeros in its binary representation. If x is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of x.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to `num`. It identifies prime numbers by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2, and then collects all the remaining unmarked numbers, which are the prime numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i+1`. It returns a dictionary `d` where `d[i]` is the highest power of prime factor `i` in the prime factorization of the initial value of `num`. The function modifies the input `num` to 1 and leaves `Prime_array` unchanged. If the initial value of `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a positive integer as input and returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of the input number and their respective counts. If the input number is a prime number, it will be included in the dictionary with a count of 1. The function reduces the input number to 1 by iteratively dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2, and updates the dictionary accordingly.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers based on the input parameters `n` and `mod`.

    #The program returns mid, where mid is the average of l and r, l is the index of the first element in p that is greater than or equal to x, and r is the last index of p.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of non-decreasing integers to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the given integer is larger than the last element in the list, the function returns the length of the list. Otherwise, it returns the index of the first element that meets the condition.

    #State: l = r = floor(sqrt(x))

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the integer square root of a non-negative integer x. It returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x. If x is 0 or 1, it returns x. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the integer square root, returning the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

#Function 21:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and mod are integers, mod is a positive integer, and b is a non-negative integer.
    ans = 1

    while b:

        a = a * a % mod
        
        b >>= 1
        
    #State: ans is equal to a to the power of b modulo mod, b is 0, a is a to the power of 2 to the power of the number of iterations of the loop modulo mod, mod remains unchanged
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is equal to a to the power of b modulo mod, where b is 0, a is a to the power of 2 to the power of the number of iterations of the loop modulo mod, and mod remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the value of 'a' to the power of 'b' modulo 'mod', where 'mod' is a positive integer and 'b' is a non-negative integer. It returns the result of this calculation, effectively performing modular exponentiation. The function modifies the input 'a' to its equivalent modulo 'mod' and iteratively squares and reduces 'a' modulo 'mod' until 'b' becomes 0, accumulating the result in 'ans' when 'b' is odd. The final state of the program is that 'ans' holds the result of the modular exponentiation, 'b' is 0, 'a' is the result of repeatedly squaring and reducing the original 'a' modulo 'mod', and 'mod' remains unchanged.

#Function 22:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of elements of any type and value, and the function is expected to return the longest common subsequence of a and b.

    #State: Output State: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1) where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first i elements of `a` and the first j elements of `b`.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1

    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the longest common subsequence between strings 'a' and 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists of elements as input and returns the longest common subsequence between them. The function does not modify the input lists. It constructs a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this table to construct the longest common subsequence in reverse order. Finally, it reverses the subsequence and returns it as a string. The function handles cases where the input lists are empty or have no common elements, returning an empty string in such cases.

#Function 23:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers

        else:
            l[pos] = i
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `l` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr`.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, removes duplicates while preserving the original order, and returns the count of unique integers. The input list remains unchanged, and a new sorted list of unique integers is created internally but not returned. The function's primary purpose is to count the number of unique integers in the input list.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not.
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: stack is an empty list, vis is a list where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, and all nodes in the graph have been visited.

#Overall this is what the function does:Performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and marks all visited nodes, printing them in the order they are visited. The function modifies the input graph's nodes' visitation status and prints the traversal order, but does not return any value.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of adjacent vertices, and vis is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are boolean values indicating whether the vertex has been visited.
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: q is an empty deque, vis is a dictionary where all vertices in the graph have been marked as visited (all values are 1).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given vertex, and marks all visited vertices. It prints the vertices in the order they are visited. The function modifies the input dictionary 'vis' by marking all vertices in the graph as visited. The function does not return any value.
