Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ver is a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of adjacent vertices, q is a deque containing the vertex ver, and vis is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are boolean values indicating whether the vertex has been visited, with ver marked as visited (vis[ver] is 1).
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
