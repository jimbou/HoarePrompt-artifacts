Output State: **i is 0, j is 0, l is a list containing the longest common subsequence between a and b in reverse order.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables i and j are both 0, and the list l contains the longest common subsequence between the lists a and b in reverse order. This is because the loop continues to decrement i and j as long as they are not 0, and appends elements to l when the current elements in a and b are equal. When the loop finishes, i and j are 0, and l contains the longest common subsequence in reverse order because elements are appended to the end of the list.
