This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i+1`. It returns a dictionary `d` where `d[i]` is the highest power of prime factor `i` in the prime factorization of the initial value of `num`. The function modifies the input `num` to 1 and leaves `Prime_array` unchanged. If the initial value of `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary.
