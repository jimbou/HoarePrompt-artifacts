Output State: **The program returns the list dearr, which contains integers. If mod is -1, the list starts with 1 and 0, and the subsequent elements are the result of the recursive formula (i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) for i ranging from 2 to n. If mod is not -1, the list starts with 1 and 0, and additional elements are the result of the loop iterations.**
