Output State: **ver is a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of adjacent vertices, q is a deque containing the vertex ver, and vis is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are boolean values indicating whether the vertex has been visited, with ver marked as visited (vis[ver] is 1).**

In this output state, the initial state remains valid, with `ver` still being a vertex in the graph, and `graph` still being a dictionary of vertices and their adjacent vertices. The `vis` dictionary also remains valid, but with the addition of `ver` being marked as visited (`vis[ver]` is now 1). The only new information is the creation of a deque `q` containing the vertex `ver`.
