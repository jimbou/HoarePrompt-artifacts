Functionality: **This function generates a list of integers based on the input parameters `n` and `mod`. If `mod` is -1, the list starts with 1 and 0, and subsequent elements are calculated using the recursive formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. If `mod` is not -1, the list starts with 1 and 0, and additional elements are calculated using the loop iterations with modulo operations. The function returns the generated list.**
