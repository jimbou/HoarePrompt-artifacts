Functionality: **This function takes two lists of elements as input and returns the longest common subsequence between them. The function does not modify the input lists. It constructs a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this table to construct the longest common subsequence in reverse order. Finally, it reverses the subsequence and returns it as a string. The function handles cases where the input lists are empty or have no common elements, returning an empty string in such cases.**
