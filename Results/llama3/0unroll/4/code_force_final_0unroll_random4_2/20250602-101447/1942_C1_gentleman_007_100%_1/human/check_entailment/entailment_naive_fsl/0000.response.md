Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Bessie wants to choose no more than y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized. However, the program does not take into account the value of y when calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake.

For example, if the input is 8 4 2, and the chosen vertices are 1 6 2 5, the program will output 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, because Bessie can choose 2 additional vertices to form 3 triangular pieces of cake.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider the value of y when calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake.
