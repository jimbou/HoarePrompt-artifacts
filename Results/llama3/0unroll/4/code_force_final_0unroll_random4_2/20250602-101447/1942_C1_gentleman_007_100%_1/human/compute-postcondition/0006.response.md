Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list containing the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b` in reverse order, `s` is a string containing the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The list `l` still contains the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b` in reverse order. The new variable `s` is assigned the value of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b` as a string, which is obtained by joining the elements of list `l` into a single string using the `join` method.
