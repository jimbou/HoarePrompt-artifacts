Functionality: **The function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given vertex, and marks all visited vertices. It prints the vertices in the order they are visited. The function modifies the input dictionary 'vis' by marking all vertices in the graph as visited. The function does not return any value.**
