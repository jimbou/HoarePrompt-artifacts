This function generates a list of n+1 lists, where each inner list at index x and y is populated with values returned by func_1() for m iterations. The function takes a positive integer n and a non-negative integer m as input, where 0 <= m <= n, and returns the populated list of lists. The function effectively constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph, where each index in the outer list corresponds to a node, and the inner lists contain the neighboring nodes.
