This function calculates the value of 'a' to the power of 'b' modulo 'mod', where 'mod' is a positive integer and 'b' is a non-negative integer. It returns the result of this calculation, effectively performing modular exponentiation. The function modifies the input 'a' to its equivalent modulo 'mod' and iteratively squares and reduces 'a' modulo 'mod' until 'b' becomes 0, accumulating the result in 'ans' when 'b' is odd. The final state of the program is that 'ans' holds the result of the modular exponentiation, 'b' is 0, 'a' is the result of repeatedly squaring and reducing the original 'a' modulo 'mod', and 'mod' remains unchanged.
