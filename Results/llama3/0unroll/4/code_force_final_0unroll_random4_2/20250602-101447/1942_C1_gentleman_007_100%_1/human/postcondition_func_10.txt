This function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to `num`. It identifies prime numbers by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2, and then collects all the remaining unmarked numbers, which are the prime numbers. The function does not modify the input `num` and only returns the list of prime numbers.
