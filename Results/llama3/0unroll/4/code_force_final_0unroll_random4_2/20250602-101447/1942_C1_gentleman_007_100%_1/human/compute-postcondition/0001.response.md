Output State: **q is an empty deque, vis is a dictionary where all vertices in the graph have been marked as visited (all values are 1).**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the queue `q` is empty, indicating that all vertices in the graph have been processed. The `vis` dictionary now marks all vertices as visited (all values are 1), indicating that the loop has traversed the entire graph.
