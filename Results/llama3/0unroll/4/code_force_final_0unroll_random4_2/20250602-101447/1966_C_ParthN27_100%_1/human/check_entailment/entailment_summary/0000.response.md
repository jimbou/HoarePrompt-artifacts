Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the differences between consecutive numbers in the sorted list of pile sizes. The program iterates through the sorted list, checking if the difference between consecutive numbers is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it breaks the loop and determines the winner based on the value of the variable 'ans'. If 'ans' is 1, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Bob'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
