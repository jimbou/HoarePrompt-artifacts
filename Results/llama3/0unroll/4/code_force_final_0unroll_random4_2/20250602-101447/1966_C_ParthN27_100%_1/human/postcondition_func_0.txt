This function simulates a game for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n and a list of n integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then determines the winner of the game based on the differences between consecutive numbers in the sorted list. The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console for each test case, indicating the winner of the game.
