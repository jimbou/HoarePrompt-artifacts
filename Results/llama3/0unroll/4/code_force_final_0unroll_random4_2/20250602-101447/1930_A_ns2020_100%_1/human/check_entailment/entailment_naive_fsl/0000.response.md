Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where in each move, two integers x and y are chosen, and the minimum of x and y is added to the score.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads the number of integers n and the 2n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order and then calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., A[::2]). This is equivalent to choosing the minimum of each pair of integers and adding it to the score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n is 1 or where all integers are the same. The sorting step ensures that the minimum of each pair is always chosen, and the slicing step (A[::2]) correctly selects every other integer.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
