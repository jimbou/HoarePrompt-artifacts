Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` between 1 and 50 (inclusive), followed by `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`, each between 1 and 10^7 (inclusive).
