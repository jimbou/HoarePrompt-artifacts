Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, then prints the sum of the integers at even indices (0-based indexing). The function repeats this process for each test case until all input has been processed, leaving the input stream empty.**
