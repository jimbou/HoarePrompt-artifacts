The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 50 inclusive) and then a series of integers (between 1 and 50 inclusive). Therefore, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a series of integers (between 1 and 50 inclusive)**
