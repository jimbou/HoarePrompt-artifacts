Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer specifies the number of subsequent integers to process. For each subsequent integer, if it is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a specific pattern of 'A's and 'B's; if the integer is odd, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all specified integers and outputs the corresponding results, leaving the initial input count unchanged.**
