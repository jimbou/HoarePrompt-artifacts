Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description.
2. The problem description states that we need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
4. Inside the function, it reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
5. It then iterates over the range of `t` using a for loop.
6. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of special characters required in the string.
7. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to create a string with an odd number of special characters.
8. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then creates a pattern of characters using a for loop.
9. The pattern is created by alternating between 'A' and 'B' characters, with each character repeated twice to create a special character.
10. The pattern is then joined into a string using the `join()` method and printed.

Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd or even and generates a string with the required number of special characters. The program also follows the specified output format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the generated string or an empty line, respectively.
