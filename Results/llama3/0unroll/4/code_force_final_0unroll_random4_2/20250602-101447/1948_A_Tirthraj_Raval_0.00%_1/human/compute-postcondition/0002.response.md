Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', followed by a pattern of 'A's and 'B's if the corresponding input number is even. The number of strings will be equal to the initial value of `t`. The state of `t` will remain unchanged.
