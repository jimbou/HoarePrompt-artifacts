Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 2, the program prints "YES" and "MM", but the problem description requires that the string has exactly n special characters, and in this case, the string "MM" has only 1 special character (at position 1). 

The program's logic is incorrect because it generates a pattern of alternating 'A's and 'B's, but this pattern does not guarantee that the resulting string will have exactly n special characters. The program should instead generate a string with n/2 pairs of identical characters, which would ensure that the string has exactly n special characters.
