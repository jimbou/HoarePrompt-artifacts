Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a series of moves. The program reads a series of integer pairs from standard input, where each pair represents the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m).

The program then uses a simple logic to determine the possibility of building the tower:

- If the number of moves (n) is equal to the desired number of cubes (m), it prints "YES".
- If the number of moves (n) is less than the desired number of cubes (m), it prints "NO".
- If the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

This logic is correct because:

- If n equals m, it's possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube at a time.
- If n is less than m, it's impossible to build the tower because there aren't enough moves to add the required number of cubes.
- If n and m have the same parity, it's possible to build the tower by adding or removing cubes in pairs, which preserves the parity.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
