Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks the following conditions:
	+ If `n` equals `m`, it prints "YES" because Nikita can build a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves by simply adding one cube at a time.
	+ If `n` is less than `m`, it prints "NO" because Nikita cannot build a tower with `m` cubes in fewer than `m` moves.
	+ If `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints "YES" because Nikita can build a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves by adding or removing cubes in pairs.
	+ Otherwise, it prints "NO" because Nikita cannot build a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves if `n` and `m` have different parities.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
