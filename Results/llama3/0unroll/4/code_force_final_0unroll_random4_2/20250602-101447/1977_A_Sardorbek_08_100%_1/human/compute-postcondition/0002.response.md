Output State: The loop will execute 'a' times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). In each iteration, it will read a line from stdin, parse it into two integers 'b' and 'c', and print 'YES' if 'b' equals 'c', 'NO' if 'b' is less than 'c', 'Yes' if 'b' and 'c' have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise. After 'a' iterations, the loop will terminate, and the state of 'a' will be unchanged, but 'a' lines will have been read from stdin and 'a' lines will have been printed to stdout.
