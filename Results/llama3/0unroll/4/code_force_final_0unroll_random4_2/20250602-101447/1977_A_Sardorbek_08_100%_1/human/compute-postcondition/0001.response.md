Output State: The loop will execute 'a' times, each time reading two integers from the standard input and printing 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the values of the integers. After the loop finishes, the state of the program will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that 'a' lines will have been read from the standard input and 'a' lines will have been printed to the standard output. The value of 'a' will remain unchanged.
