Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. It checks if the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m), in which case it prints 'YES'. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a tower with more cubes than moves. If n is greater than m, it checks if n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes' because it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs. If n and m have different parity, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes.

Correctness: **True**
