Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The logic is as follows:

- If b (number of moves) is equal to c (number of cubes), it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube at a time, so the program prints 'YES'.
- If b is less than c, it is not possible to build the tower because the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, so the program prints 'NO'.
- If b is greater than c, the program checks if b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it is possible to build the tower by adding or removing cubes in pairs, so the program prints 'Yes'. If they do not have the same parity, it is not possible to build the tower, so the program prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description.
