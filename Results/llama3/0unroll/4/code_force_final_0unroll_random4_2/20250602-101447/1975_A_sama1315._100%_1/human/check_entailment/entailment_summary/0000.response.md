Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if a given list of positive integers is already sorted by comparing it with its sorted version. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted, 'No' if it's not, and 'None' if the list is empty or contains only one element.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, applies the `func_1` function to each list of integers, and prints the results.

The key insight here is that `func_1` is not just checking if the original array is sorted, but also if any rotation of the array is sorted. This is because it checks all possible rotations of the array by comparing the concatenated array (`a + a`) with the sorted array.

Since the problem allows for any number of swaps of the two parts of the array, it is equivalent to checking if any rotation of the array is sorted. Therefore, `func_1` is correctly solving the problem.

`func_2` is simply a wrapper around `func_1`, reading input and printing the results, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
