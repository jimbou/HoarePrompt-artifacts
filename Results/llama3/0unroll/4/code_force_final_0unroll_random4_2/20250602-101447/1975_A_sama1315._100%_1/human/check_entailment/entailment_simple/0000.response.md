Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.

In `func_1`, the program first checks if the array is already sorted by comparing it with its sorted version. If it is already sorted, the function returns 'Yes'. If not, the program creates a concatenated version of the array by appending the original array to itself. Then, it checks if any subarray of the concatenated array is equal to the sorted array. If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes'. If no such subarray is found after checking all possible subarrays, the function returns 'No'.

The main function `func_2` reads the input data, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains a positive integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated positive integers. The function applies `func_1` to each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It checks all possible subarrays of the concatenated array, which ensures that it does not miss any possible solution. The use of the concatenated array is a clever trick to simplify the problem, as it allows the program to check all possible splits of the original array in a single pass.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
