Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times. It does this by concatenating the array with itself and checking if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array. If it is, then the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description and it also handles edge cases such as an array with only one element or an array that is already sorted.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(n) because the program creates a new sorted array and a concatenated array.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.
