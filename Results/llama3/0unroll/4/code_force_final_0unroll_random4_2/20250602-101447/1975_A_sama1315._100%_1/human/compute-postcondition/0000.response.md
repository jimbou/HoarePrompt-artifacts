Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t pairs of positive integers n and n space-separated positive integers, idx is 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a pair of positive integers `n` and `n` space-separated positive integers. The variable `idx` is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1, indicating that the first element of `data` has been processed. The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first element of `data`, which is a positive integer. The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list, which will likely be used to store the results of each test case.
