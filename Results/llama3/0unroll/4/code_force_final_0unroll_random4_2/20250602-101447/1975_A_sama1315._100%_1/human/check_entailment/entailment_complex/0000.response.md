Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining whether a given array of positive integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function 1 checks if the given array is already sorted by comparing it with its sorted version. If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating it with itself and checking if the sorted version is a substring of the concatenated array. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. If not, it returns 'No'.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, applies Function 1 to each list of integers, and prints the results.

The key insight here is that Function 1 correctly checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating it with itself and checking if the sorted version is a substring of the concatenated array. This is because the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them is equivalent to rotating the array, and the concatenated array contains all possible rotations of the original array.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
