Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function 1, `func_1(a)`, attempts to solve this problem by concatenating the input array `a` with itself, creating a new array `concatenated_a`. It then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` with the same length as the sorted version of `a` is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The reasoning for the correctness of the program is as follows:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem description.
2.  The `func_1(a)` function correctly checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating it with itself and checking for the presence of the sorted subarray.
3.  The `func_2()` function correctly calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and prints the results.

Based on this reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
