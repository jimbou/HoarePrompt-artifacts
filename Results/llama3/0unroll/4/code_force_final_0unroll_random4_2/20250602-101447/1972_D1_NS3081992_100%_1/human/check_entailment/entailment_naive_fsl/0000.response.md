Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the mathematical formula to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The formula is based on the concept of greatest common divisor (GCD) and the properties of multiples.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over all possible values of i, where i is the GCD of a and b. For each i, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions and adds it to the total count.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n or m is 1, and it also handles the case when n and m are large numbers.

The program's time complexity is O(sqrt(m)), which is efficient for the given constraints. The program's space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it accurately solves the problem.
