Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program uses a combination of functions to read input, process data, and calculate the number of valid pairs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) using Function 10 (func_10). This is correct, as it reads an integer value from the input.

2. For each test case, the program reads two integers (n, m) using Function 7 (func_7). This is correct, as it reads two integer values from the input.

3. The program then calls Function 15 (func_15) to calculate the number of valid pairs for the given (n, m) values. This function uses a while loop to iterate over possible values of i, where i is a divisor of both n and m.

4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the number of valid pairs by adding (n + i) // (i * i) to the answer (ans). This calculation is based on the problem's condition that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

5. The function returns the calculated answer minus 1, which is the correct result according to the problem statement.

6. The program then writes the result to the output using sys.stdout.write.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly reads input, processes data, and calculates the number of valid pairs according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
