Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_3() a specified number of times, equal to the value of rows_number, and returns this list.

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line from standard input and returns the line as a string with trailing newlines and other whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line of text from standard input, removes the newline character, and decodes the string, returning the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  Takes a string of two space-separated integers as input, parses it, and returns a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads a string from standard input and returns it unchanged, effectively echoing the input string.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a value from the input string.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates a temporary variable 'tmp' with the minimum rank found, and returns 'tmp + 1', which is also assigned to the corresponding index in the 'rank' list. The function also temporarily modifies the 'processing' list during its execution.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with b and a % b, and returns the results with adjustments to x and y.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function evaluates a list of integers against a threshold value and returns an indicator based on the cumulative difference. It takes a list of integers, a threshold value, and an initial integer as input. The function iterates through the list, subtracting the difference between the threshold and each element (if the element is less than the threshold) from the initial integer. If the resulting value is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating an error or invalid result. The function does not modify the input list.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Calculates the sum of a series of integer divisions, specifically (n + j) // (j * j), for all integers j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from this sum. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the external function func_7() to provide positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns the calculated sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function generates a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is determined by the positive integer returned by func_10(). Each string is the result of converting the value returned by func_15() to a string. The function writes this sequence to the standard output.
