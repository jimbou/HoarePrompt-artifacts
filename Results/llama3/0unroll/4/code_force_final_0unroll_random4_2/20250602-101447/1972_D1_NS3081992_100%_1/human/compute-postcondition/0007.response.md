Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates a temporary variable 'tmp' with the minimum rank found, and returns 'tmp + 1', which is also assigned to the corresponding index in the 'rank' list. The function also temporarily modifies the 'processing' list during its execution.**
