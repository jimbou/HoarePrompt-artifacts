Calculates the sum of a series of integer divisions, specifically (n + j) // (j * j), for all integers j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from this sum. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the external function func_7() to provide positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns the calculated sum minus 1.
