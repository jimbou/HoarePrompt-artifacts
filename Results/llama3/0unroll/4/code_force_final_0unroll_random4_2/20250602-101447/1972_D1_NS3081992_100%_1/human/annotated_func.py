    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of two integers that were input as a string of two space-separated integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates a temporary variable 'tmp' with the minimum rank found, and returns 'tmp + 1', which is also assigned to the corresponding index in the 'rank' list. The function also temporarily modifies the 'processing' list during its execution.

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)

    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y is a returned value from func_13(b, a % b), x is a returned value from func_13(b, a % b), g is a returned value from func_13(b, a % b), a is an integer greater than or equal to b, and b is an integer greater than or equal to 0 but not equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with b and a % b, and returns the results with adjustments to x and y.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1, an integer that is negative and represents an error or invalid value, indicating that the program has terminated or encountered an issue.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of integers against a threshold value and returns an indicator based on the cumulative difference. It takes a list of integers, a threshold value, and an initial integer as input. The function iterates through the list, subtracting the difference between the threshold and each element (if the element is less than the threshold) from the initial integer. If the resulting value is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating an error or invalid result. The function does not modify the input list.

    #The program returns the sum of (n + j) // (j * j) for all integers j from 1 to i - 1 inclusive minus 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that i * i > n + i.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of a series of integer divisions, specifically (n + j) // (j * j), for all integers j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from this sum. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on the external function func_7() to provide positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns the calculated sum minus 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a positive integer, and the function func_15() returns a value that can be converted to a string.

    #State: The output state is a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is equal to the positive integer returned by func_10(). Each string is the result of converting the value returned by func_15() to a string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is determined by the positive integer returned by func_10(). Each string is the result of converting the value returned by func_15() to a string. The function writes this sequence to the standard output.
