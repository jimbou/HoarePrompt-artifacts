Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads the number of elements in the array (n), the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove (k), and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to (x).

2. It then reads the elements of the array and sorts them in descending order.

3. It calculates the initial sum of the array (ans1) and then subtracts twice the value of the x largest elements from the sum (because Bob will multiply these elements by -1).

4. It then iterates over the k largest elements, adding each element to the sum (because Alice will remove these elements) and subtracting twice the value of the element at index i + x (because Bob will multiply this element by -1 after Alice removes the k largest elements).

5. It keeps track of the maximum sum (ans) seen so far and prints this value for each test case.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
