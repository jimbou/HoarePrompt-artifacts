Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game strategy. The issue lies in the way Alice's and Bob's moves are simulated. The program first calculates the sum of the array after Bob's move, and then tries to maximize this sum by adding back some of the elements that Alice removed. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice.

A correct approach would be to first remove the k largest elements from the array (since Alice wants to maximize the sum), and then let Bob multiply the x largest remaining elements by -1. This way, Alice removes the largest elements that would contribute the most to the sum, and Bob minimizes the sum by multiplying the largest remaining elements by -1.

For example, consider the input:

6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -5. The correct strategy for Alice is to remove the elements 32 and 15, and then Bob will multiply the element 7 by -1, resulting in a sum of -5.
