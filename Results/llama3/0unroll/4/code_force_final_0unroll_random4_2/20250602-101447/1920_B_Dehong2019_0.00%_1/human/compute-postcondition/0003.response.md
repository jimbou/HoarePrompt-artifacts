Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers (t, k, x) and a list of t integers. It calculates the maximum possible sum of the list after removing k elements and subtracting x from the sum, and prints this value for each test case. The function consumes the contents of standard input and produces t output values, one for each test case.**
