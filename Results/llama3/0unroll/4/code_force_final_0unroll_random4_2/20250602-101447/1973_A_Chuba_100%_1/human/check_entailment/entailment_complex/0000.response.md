Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the three scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and checks if their sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be achieved with any valid set of games and results.
3.  If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws as half of the sum of the scores minus the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest and lowest scores (`v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`). This calculation is correct because it considers the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred given the scores.
4.  The program outputs the result for each test case, which is either `-1` or a positive integer representing the maximum possible number of draws.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number of draws given the scores of three players, and it handles invalid inputs by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
