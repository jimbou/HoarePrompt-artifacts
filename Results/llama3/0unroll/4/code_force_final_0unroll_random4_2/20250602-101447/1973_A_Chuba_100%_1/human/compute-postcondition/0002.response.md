Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then calculates and prints the result for each test case. If the sum of the three scores is odd, it prints -1. If the sum is even, it calculates the result as half of the sum of the scores minus the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest and lowest scores. The function outputs a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the calculation for each test case, with the same number of elements as the number of test cases.**
