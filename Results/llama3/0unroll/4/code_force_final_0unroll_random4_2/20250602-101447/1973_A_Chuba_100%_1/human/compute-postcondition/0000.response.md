Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain three integers each, representing the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
