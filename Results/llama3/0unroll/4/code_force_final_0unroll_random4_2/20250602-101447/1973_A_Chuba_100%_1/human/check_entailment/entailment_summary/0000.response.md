Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd, in which case it prints -1 as there is no valid set of games that can produce such scores. For even sums, it calculates the maximum number of draws that could have occurred by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest and lowest scores from the sum of the scores, and then dividing the result by 2. This is a correct approach as it takes into account the fact that each game can result in either a win, a loss, or a draw, and that the scores are non-negative.

Correctness: **True**
