Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players. It first checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid (since each game can result in either 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 point for each player in case of a draw). If the sum is odd, it prints -1, indicating that the scores are not valid.

If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lower scores) from the total sum of scores, and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum, and the maximum number of draws is achieved when the number of wins is minimized.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided, and it is not possible to find a case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
