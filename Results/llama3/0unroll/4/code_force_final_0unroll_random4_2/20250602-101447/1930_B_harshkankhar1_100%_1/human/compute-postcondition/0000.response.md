Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the number of test cases, with every other element reversed, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the length of the permutation p for each test case).**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified to contain the integers from 1 to the number of test cases, with every other element reversed. The stdin still contains the list of integers representing the length of the permutation p for each test case, as this input was not consumed by the code.
