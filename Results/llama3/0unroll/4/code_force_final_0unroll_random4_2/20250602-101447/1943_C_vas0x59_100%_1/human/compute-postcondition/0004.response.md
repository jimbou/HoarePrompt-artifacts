Output State: **path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex 0.**

The loop iterates until it reaches the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex 0 (vertex a). At each iteration, it appends the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to the current vertex to the path_ba list. When the loop finishes, path_ba will contain the shortest path from vertex b to vertex 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
