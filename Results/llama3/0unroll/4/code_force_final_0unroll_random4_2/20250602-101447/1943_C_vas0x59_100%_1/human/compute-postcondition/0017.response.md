Output: **A list of pairs where the first element of each pair is c + 1 and the second element is a number from 1 to the length of path_ba minus c - 1 with a step of 2, if the length of path_ba is even, otherwise a list of pairs where the first element of each pair is c + 1 and the second element is a number from 0 to ci, where c is an element from path_ba and ci is an index from the range 1 to len(path_ba) - 1 with a step of 2**
