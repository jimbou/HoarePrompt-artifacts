Output State: **The list u2vs now contains n lists where each list at index i contains all the vertices v that are directly connected to vertex i by an edge in the graph described by the input. The variable d contains the shortest distance from vertex a to all other vertices in the graph. The variable a is the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex 0. The variable previous contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to all other vertices. The variable b is the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex a. The variable path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a.**

Note: The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so its behavior is assumed to return the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from a given vertex. The function `bfs` is also not defined, but it is assumed to perform a breadth-first search in the graph and return the shortest distance and previous vertex for each vertex.
