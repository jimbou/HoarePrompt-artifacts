#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input describing a graph, constructs the graph, finds the shortest path between two vertices, and then generates a list of operations based on the path. The operations are either a single vertex repeated with increasing indices or two alternating vertices with increasing indices, depending on the length of the path. The function then prints the length of the operations list and the operations themselves, with each operation represented as a pair of vertex and index. Finally, the function returns None.
