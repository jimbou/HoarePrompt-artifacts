Output State: `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from `path_ba` and an index from the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2. The elements from `path_ba` are `c1` and `c2`, which are the elements at indices `ci1` and `ci2` in `path_ba`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
