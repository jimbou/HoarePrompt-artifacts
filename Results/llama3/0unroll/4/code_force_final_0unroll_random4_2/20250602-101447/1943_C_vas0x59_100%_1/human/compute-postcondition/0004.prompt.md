Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list u2vs now contains n lists where each list at index i contains all the vertices v that are directly connected to vertex i by an edge in the graph described by the input. The variable d contains the shortest distance from vertex a to all other vertices in the graph. The variable a is the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex 0. The variable previous contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to all other vertices. The variable b is the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex a. The variable path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
