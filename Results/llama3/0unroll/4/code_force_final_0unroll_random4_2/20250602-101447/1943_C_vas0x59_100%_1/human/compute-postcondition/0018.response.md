Output: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex 0, `ops` is a list. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains ci + 1 pairs where the first element of each pair is c and the second element is a number from 0 to ci. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from `path_ba` and an index from the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2. The elements from `path_ba` are `c1` and `c2`, which are the elements at indices `ci1` and `ci2` in `path_ba`, respectively, and the following is printed: For each pair in `ops`, a string in the format '[c + 1] [index]' is printed, where 'c' is the first element of the pair and 'index' is the second element of the pair, with each string printed on a new line.**
