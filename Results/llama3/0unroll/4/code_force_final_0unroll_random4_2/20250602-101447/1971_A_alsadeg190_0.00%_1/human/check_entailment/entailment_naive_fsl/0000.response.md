Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input values are equal. In this case, the program should print the same value twice, but the program's logic does not handle this case correctly. For example, when the input is "3 3", the program will print "3 3" which is correct, but when the input is "0 0", the program will also print "0 0" which is correct, but when the input is "9 9", the program will also print "9 9" which is correct. However, the program's logic does not explicitly handle the case when the input values are equal, it just happens to work correctly in this case. But in the case of "2 2" the program will print "2 2" which is correct, but the program does not explicitly handle this case. 

However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the program should handle the case when the input values are equal, but it does not explicitly state that the program should not handle this case either. 

But there is another case when the program does not work correctly. The problem description states that the program should output two integers: the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. But the program does not do this. The program checks if x is greater than y, and if so, it prints x and then y. But this is not the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The correct output in this case would be y and then x. 

For example, when the input is "8 4", the program will print "8 4", but the correct output should be "4 8". 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly in all cases, and the correctness is **False**.
