#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation `pow * (2 * k - 1)` for each iteration of the loop, where `pow` is the current power of 2 and `k` is the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the total sum of the elements in list `L` from it. The number of output integers will be equal to the value of `t`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of n and k, and prints the result. The calculation involves iterating through a list L (which is not explicitly populated in the provided code), keeping track of a total sum and a power of 2, and printing the product of the power of 2 and a calculated value based on k. The function repeats this process for each test case, resulting in a series of output integers equal to the number of test cases.
