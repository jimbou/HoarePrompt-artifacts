This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of n and k, and prints the result. The calculation involves iterating through a list L (which is not explicitly populated in the provided code), keeping track of a total sum and a power of 2, and printing the product of the power of 2 and a calculated value based on k. The function repeats this process for each test case, resulting in a series of output integers equal to the number of test cases.
