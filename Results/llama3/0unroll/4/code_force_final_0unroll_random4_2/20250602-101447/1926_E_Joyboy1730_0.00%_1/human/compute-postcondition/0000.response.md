The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4). After accepting the first line, the stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5⋅10^4, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9)**
