Output State: **The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation `pow * (2 * k - 1)` for each iteration of the loop, where `pow` is the current power of 2 and `k` is the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the total sum of the elements in list `L` from it. The number of output integers will be equal to the value of `t`.**
