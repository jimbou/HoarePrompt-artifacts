Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string contains only '>' characters. In this case, the pinball will move to the right and never leave the grid, but the program will still output a value for each cell, which is incorrect. The program should output a special value, such as -1, to indicate that the pinball will never leave the grid in this case.

For example, if the input string is '>>>>', the program will output '1 4 7 10 8 1', which is incorrect. The correct output should be '-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1' to indicate that the pinball will never leave the grid.
