Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros.**

Here's a breakdown of the final state:

* `s1` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
* `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`. This means that `pre` contains the positions of all '>' characters in `s1`, where the first character is considered to be at index 1.
* `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. This is calculated by taking the length of the `pre` list, which contains the indices of all '>' characters.
* `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. This means that `preOne` contains the cumulative sum of the indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, starting from 0.
* `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0. This list is initialized with a single element 0 and is not modified further.
* `ans` is a list of `n` zeros. This list is initialized with `n` zeros and is not modified further.

Note that the code does not modify the original string `s1` or the value of `n`. It only creates new variables and lists based on the contents of `s1`.
