Based on the precondition, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the calculated values for each index in the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains `n` integers, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`. Each integer in the `ans` list represents the calculated value for the corresponding index in the string `s1`.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `ans` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values for each index in the string `s1`.

Output: **The calculated values for each index in the string s1 (where the values are the elements of the ans list)**
