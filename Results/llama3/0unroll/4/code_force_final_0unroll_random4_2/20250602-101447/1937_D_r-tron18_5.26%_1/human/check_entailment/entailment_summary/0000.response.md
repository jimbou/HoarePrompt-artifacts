Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell. The pinball moves according to the rules specified in the problem.

2. Function `func_2` takes the input string `s1` and its length `n` as input. It calculates the prefix sum of indices of '>' characters and the suffix sum of indices of '<' characters.

3. The function then iterates over the input string from right to left. For each index, it calculates the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters.

4. The calculated difference represents the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the current cell. This is because the pinball moves to the left when it encounters a '<' character and to the right when it encounters a '>' character.

5. The function `func_1` is used to calculate the difference between the last element of a list and the element at a specific index. This function is used in `func_2` to calculate the cumulative sum of indices of '<' and '>' characters.

6. The output of `func_2` is a list of integers representing the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

7. The program iterates over multiple test cases, reading the input string and its length for each case, and calls `func_2` to calculate the output.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it is clear that the program correctly implements the rules specified in the problem and calculates the required output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
