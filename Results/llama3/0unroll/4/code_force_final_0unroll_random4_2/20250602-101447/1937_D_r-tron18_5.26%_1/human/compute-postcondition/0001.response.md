Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: s1 remains the same string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n remains the same positive integer, pre remains the same list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1, and ans is a list of n integers representing the calculated values based on the given conditions.
