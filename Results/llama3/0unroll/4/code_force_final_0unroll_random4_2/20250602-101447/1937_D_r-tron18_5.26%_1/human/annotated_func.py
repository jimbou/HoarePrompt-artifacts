#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of a given list of integers and the element at a specific index, which is determined by the maximum of two values: the negative length of the list and the negative of 1 minus a given non-negative integer.

    #State: The final state after the loop execution is: s1 remains the same string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n remains the same positive integer, pre remains the same list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1, and ans is a list of n integers representing the calculated values for each index.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns a list of integers representing the difference between the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters in the input string s1, for each index in the string. The function takes a string s1 consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the calculated value for the corresponding index in the string.
