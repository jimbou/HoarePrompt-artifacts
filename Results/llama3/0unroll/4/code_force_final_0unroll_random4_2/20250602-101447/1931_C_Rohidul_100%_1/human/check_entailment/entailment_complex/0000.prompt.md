Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        le = len(a)
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 1, 1
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state will contain the same number of test cases as the initial state. Each test case will contain a single integer, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make all elements equal. The output state will be in the same format as the initial state, with each test case on a new line.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list to make all elements equal. The function considers two cases: when the first and last elements are equal, and when they are not. It calculates the minimum number of removals required in each case and prints the result for each test case.
