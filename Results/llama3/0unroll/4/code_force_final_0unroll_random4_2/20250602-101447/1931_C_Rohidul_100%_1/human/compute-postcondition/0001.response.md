Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list to make all elements equal. The function considers two cases: when the first and last elements are equal, and when they are not. It calculates the minimum number of removals required in each case and prints the result for each test case.**
