Output State: **n is 0, stdin is empty, and the standard output contains 4n lines, each containing a single integer representing the area of a rectangle.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` becomes 0, the standard input (`stdin`) is empty because all the lines have been read, and the standard output contains `4n` lines, each containing a single integer representing the area of a rectangle calculated from the coordinates read from the input.
