Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The issue lies in the calculation of the area. The program calculates the distance between two points (p1 and p2) and then multiplies the square roots of these distances. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the area of a square.

The correct way to calculate the area of a square is to find the length of one side and then square it. The program does not do this correctly. It calculates the distance between two points, which is not necessarily the length of a side of the square.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2

The program will calculate the distance between points (1,2) and (4,5) and between points (1,5) and (4,2), which are not the lengths of the sides of the square. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output.

A correct solution would involve finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculating the length of the side of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates. The area of the square would then be the square of this length.
