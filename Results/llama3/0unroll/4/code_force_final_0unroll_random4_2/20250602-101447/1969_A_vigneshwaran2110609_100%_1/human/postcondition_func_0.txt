The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then checks each test case for a specific condition, printing 2 if the condition is met (i.e., a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) exists such that p_i = j and p_j = i) and 3 otherwise. The function does not modify the input values and only prints the results for each test case.
