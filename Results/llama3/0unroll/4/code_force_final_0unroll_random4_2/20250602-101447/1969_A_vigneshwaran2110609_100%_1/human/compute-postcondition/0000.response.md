The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). Since `n` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input, `n` is now an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**
