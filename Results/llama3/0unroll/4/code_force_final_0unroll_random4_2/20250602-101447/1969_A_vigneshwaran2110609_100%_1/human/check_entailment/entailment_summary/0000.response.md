Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, j) such that i's best friend is j and j's best friend is i. If such a pair exists, it prints 2, because Monocarp can send invitations to both i and j, and both will come to the party. If no such pair exists, it prints 3, because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 come to the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It does not modify the input values and only prints the results for each test case, as required.

Correctness: **True**
