Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = j and p_j = i. If such a pair exists, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp can send invitations to these two friends and both will come to the party. If no such pair exists, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two come to the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of a flag variable to break out of the loop as soon as a pair is found is also efficient.

Correctness: **True**
