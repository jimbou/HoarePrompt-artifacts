You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) separated by a space, where n is the number of distinct types of cards and k is the number of coins. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) separated by a space, representing the number of cards of type i.
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        r = a[0]
        
        rem = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
        
    #State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the number of cards of a specific type, printed on separate lines. The number of lines is equal to the number of test cases (t). For each test case, the output is calculated based on the number of distinct types of cards (n), the number of coins (k), and the sorted list of card types (a). The output is either (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n or (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, depending on whether k is 0 or not, where r is the maximum number of cards of a specific type that can be bought with the available coins, and rem and y are intermediate calculations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
