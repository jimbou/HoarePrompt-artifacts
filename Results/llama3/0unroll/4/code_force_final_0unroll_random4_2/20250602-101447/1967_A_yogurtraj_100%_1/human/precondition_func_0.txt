stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) separated by a space, where n is the number of distinct types of cards and k is the number of coins. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) separated by a space, representing the number of cards of type i.
