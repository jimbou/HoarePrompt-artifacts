Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the number of cards of a specific type, printed on separate lines. The number of lines is equal to the number of test cases (t). For each test case, the output is calculated based on the number of distinct types of cards (n), the number of coins (k), and the sorted list of card types (a). The output is either (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n or (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, depending on whether k is 0 or not, where r is the maximum number of cards of a specific type that can be bought with the available coins, and rem and y are intermediate calculations.**
