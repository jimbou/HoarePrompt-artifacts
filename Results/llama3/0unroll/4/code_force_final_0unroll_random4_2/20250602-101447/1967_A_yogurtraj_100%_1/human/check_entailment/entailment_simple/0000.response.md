Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum score that can be obtained by rearranging the cards in a line. The program first sorts the list of card types in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the maximum number of cards of a specific type that can be bought with the available coins. If there are remaining coins after buying the maximum number of cards, it calculates the additional score that can be obtained by using the remaining coins. Finally, it prints the total score.

The program handles the case where there are no remaining coins after buying the maximum number of cards, and it also handles the case where there are remaining coins. The calculations for the total score are correct, and the program produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
