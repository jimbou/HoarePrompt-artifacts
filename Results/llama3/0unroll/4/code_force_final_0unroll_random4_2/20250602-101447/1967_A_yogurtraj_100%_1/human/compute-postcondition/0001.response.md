Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of the number of distinct types of cards (n), the number of coins (k), and a list of card types (a). It calculates the maximum number of cards of a specific type that can be bought with the available coins, considering the sorted list of card types, and prints the result for each test case. The output is either the number of cards of the most expensive type that can be bought with the remaining coins or the number of cards of the most expensive type that can be bought with the available coins plus the remaining coins, depending on whether there are remaining coins or not.**
