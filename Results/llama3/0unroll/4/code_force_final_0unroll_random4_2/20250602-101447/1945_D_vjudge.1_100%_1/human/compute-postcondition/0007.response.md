Output: **The variable ans now holds the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range k. The values of n, k, a, b, and c remain unchanged. The list suff still contains the cumulative sum of the list c in reverse order, where suff[i] is the sum of all elements in c from index i to n-1, and the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range k which is stored in ans is being printed**
