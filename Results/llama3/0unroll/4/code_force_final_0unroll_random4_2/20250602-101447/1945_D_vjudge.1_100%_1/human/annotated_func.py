#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The list suff now contains the cumulative sum of the list c in reverse order, where suff[i] is the sum of all elements in c from index i to n-1. The values of n, k, a, b, and c remain unchanged.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The variable ans now holds the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range k. The values of n, k, a, b, and c remain unchanged. The list suff still contains the cumulative sum of the list c in reverse order, where suff[i] is the sum of all elements in c from index i to n-1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range k

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum sum of pairs of elements from two lists, 'a' and 'b', within a specified range 'k'. It takes four parameters: 'n' (the length of the lists), 'k' (the range within which to consider pairs), and two lists 'a' and 'b' of 'n' integers each. The function returns the minimum sum of 'a[i]' and the cumulative sum of the minimum elements from 'i+1' to 'n-1' between lists 'a' and 'b', for all 'i' in the range 'k'.
