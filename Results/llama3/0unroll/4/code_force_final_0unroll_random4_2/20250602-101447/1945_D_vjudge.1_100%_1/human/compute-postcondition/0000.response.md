Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, c is a list of n integers where c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i for all i, suff is a list of n+1 zeros.**

The first line of the code creates a new list `c` where each element `c_i` is the minimum of the corresponding elements `a_i` and `b_i` from lists `a` and `b`, respectively. This operation does not modify the original lists `a` and `b`, but rather creates a new list `c` with the minimum values.

The second line initializes a new list `suff` with `n+1` zeros. This list is not related to the previous lists `a`, `b`, or `c`, and its purpose is not specified in the given code snippet.

The initial state of `n` and `k` as integers such that `1 <= k <= n <= 200,000` remains unchanged, as well as the state of lists `a` and `b` containing `n` integers each, with values between `1` and `10^9`.
