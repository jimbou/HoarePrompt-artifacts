Functionality: **This function compares two binary strings of equal length and returns the number of mismatched character pairs. It considers a pair of characters as mismatched if they are different and either the next pair of characters is also different or there is no next pair (i.e., it's the last pair). The function effectively counts the number of transitions from a match to a mismatch or vice versa in the two strings.**
