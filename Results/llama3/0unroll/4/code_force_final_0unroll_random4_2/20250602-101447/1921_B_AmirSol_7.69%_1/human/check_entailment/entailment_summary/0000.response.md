Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The function `func_1` compares the two binary strings `s1` and `s2` character by character, and whenever it finds a mismatch, it increments the counter. If the next pair of characters is also different and the current character in `s1` is different from the next character in `s1`, it increments the counter and moves two steps forward. Otherwise, it just increments the counter and moves one step forward. This logic correctly handles the three types of operations: adding a cat, removing a cat, and moving a cat from one box to another.

Correctness: **True**
