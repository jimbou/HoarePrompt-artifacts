#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: counter is the number of mismatched character pairs between s1 and s2, i is n.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of mismatched character pairs between strings s1 and s2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two binary strings of equal length and returns the number of mismatched character pairs. It considers a pair of characters as mismatched if they are different and either the next pair of characters is also different or there is no next pair (i.e., it's the last pair). The function effectively counts the number of transitions from a match to a mismatch or vice versa in the two strings.
