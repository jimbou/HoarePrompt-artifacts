Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`, the program prints `4`, but the correct answer is `2`. This is because the program incorrectly adds `2` to the result, which is not justified by the problem description.

The problem description states that each firework is visible in the sky for `m + 1` minutes after launch, and the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation in the time interval `[x, x + m]`, where `x` is the time when the installations were turned on. The program's logic is incorrect, and it does not accurately calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation in the time interval `[x, x + m]` and summing them up. The correct code would be:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 1)
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by summing up the number of fireworks launched by each installation in the time interval `[x, x + m]`.
