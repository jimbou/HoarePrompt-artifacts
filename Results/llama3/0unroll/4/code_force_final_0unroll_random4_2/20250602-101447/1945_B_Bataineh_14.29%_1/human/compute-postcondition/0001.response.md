Output State: **The output state will contain `t` lines, each containing an integer that represents the minimum number of operations required to make `a` and `b` equal to `m`. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.**
