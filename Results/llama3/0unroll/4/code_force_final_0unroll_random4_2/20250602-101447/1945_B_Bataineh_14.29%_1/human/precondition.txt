The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) â€” the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.
