    #State: Output State: The frequency_table dictionary contains the frequency of each number in the arr list, but with a maximum frequency of k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns the frequency_table dictionary, which contains the frequency of each number in the arr list, but with a maximum frequency of k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the frequency of each number in a given list of integers, capping the frequency at a specified maximum value k. It returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique numbers from the list and the values are their respective frequencies, limited to a maximum of k. The original list and the maximum frequency value k remain unchanged.
