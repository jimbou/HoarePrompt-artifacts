Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, and the length of `arr` is equal to the number of cards `n`.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `frequency_table` which is an empty dictionary. The values of the other variables, `arr` and `k`, remain unchanged. The length of `arr` is still equal to the number of cards `n`, as specified in the initial state.
