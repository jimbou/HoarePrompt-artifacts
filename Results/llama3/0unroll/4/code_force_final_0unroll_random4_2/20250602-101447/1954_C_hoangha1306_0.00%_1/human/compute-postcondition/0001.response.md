Output State: The output state will be a list of 2t strings, where each pair of strings represents the modified numbers after comparing the corresponding digits of the input numbers. The digits are compared from left to right, and the smaller digit is placed in the first string and the larger digit in the second string. If the digits are equal, they are placed in both strings. The process is repeated for all t pairs of input numbers.
