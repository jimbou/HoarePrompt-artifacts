The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits. 

After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input. The stdin now contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.**
