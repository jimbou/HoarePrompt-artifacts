Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes pairs of integers, and prints pairs of integers as output. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of pairs to process, followed by t pairs of integers x and y. For each pair, it compares the corresponding digits of x and y, placing the smaller digit in the first integer of the output pair and the larger digit in the second integer. If the digits are equal, they are placed in both integers of the output pair. The function prints each output pair on separate lines. The output state consists of a series of pairs of integers, with the same number of pairs and digits as the input state.**
