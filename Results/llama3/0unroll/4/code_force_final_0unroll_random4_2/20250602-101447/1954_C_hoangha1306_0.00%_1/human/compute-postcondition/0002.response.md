Output State: The output state will be a series of pairs of integers, where each pair consists of two integers that are the result of comparing the corresponding digits of the input pairs. The comparison is done in a way that the smaller digit is always placed in the first integer of the pair, and the larger digit is always placed in the second integer of the pair. If the digits are equal, they are placed in both integers of the pair. The output state will have the same number of pairs as the input state, and each pair will have the same number of digits as the input pairs.
