Output State: **The output will be t lines, each containing a single integer which is the maximum sum of n integers that can be obtained by selecting either a or b, where the sum is calculated as the sum of the first k integers from b to b-k+1 (where k is the minimum of b-a+1 and n) plus the sum of the remaining n-k integers as a.**
