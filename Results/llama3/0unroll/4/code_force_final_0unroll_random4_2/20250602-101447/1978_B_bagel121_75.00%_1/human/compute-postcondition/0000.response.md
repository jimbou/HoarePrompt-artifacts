Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, with each line containing three integers n, a, and b, all within the range of 1 to 10^9.
