This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It then divides the range from 0 to n-1 into cliques of size k, and for each clique, it sets the corresponding elements in the array arr to the clique number (starting from 1). The function prints the modified array arr, the number of cliques, and the list cliquess (which remains unchanged). The function does not return any value.
