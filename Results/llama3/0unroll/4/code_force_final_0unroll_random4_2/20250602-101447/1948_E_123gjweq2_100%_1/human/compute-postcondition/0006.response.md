The code prints the elements of the list `cliquess`. Since the exact values of the elements in the list `cliquess` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `cliquess`.

Output: **the elements of the list cliquess**
