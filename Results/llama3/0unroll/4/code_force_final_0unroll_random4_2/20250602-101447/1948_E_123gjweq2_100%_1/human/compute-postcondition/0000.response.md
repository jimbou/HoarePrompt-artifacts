Output State: **left is a non-negative integer, right is a non-negative integer greater than left, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of size at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of size at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is (right - left + 1) - mid**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged. The variable `small_element` is assigned the value of `left + 1`, and `big_element` is assigned the value of `right + 1`. The variable `mid` is calculated as half of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` plus one, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The variable `not_mid` is calculated as the total range (`right - left + 1`) minus `mid`.
