Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a graph into the minimum number of cliques. The program takes two integers, n and k, as input and assigns distinct integers to each vertex in the graph. The program then determines the minimum number of cliques required to partition the graph.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines two functions: func_1 and make_array. func_1 is the main function that takes n and k as input and calculates the minimum number of cliques required. make_array is a helper function that assigns integers to the vertices in each clique.

2. In func_1, the program calculates the minimum number of cliques required using the formula ceil(n / k). This is because each clique can have at most k vertices, and the total number of vertices is n.

3. The program then initializes two arrays: arr and cliquess. arr is used to store the assigned integers for each vertex, and cliquess is used to store the clique number for each vertex.

4. The program then calls the make_array function for each clique. The make_array function takes three parameters: left, right, and clique. left and right represent the range of vertices in the current clique, and clique is the clique number.

5. In the make_array function, the program calculates the small_element and big_element, which are the smallest and largest integers that can be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.

6. The program then calculates the mid and not_mid values, which represent the number of vertices that should be assigned the smaller integers and the number of vertices that should be assigned the larger integers, respectively.

7. The program then assigns the integers to the vertices in the current clique using two loops. The first loop assigns the smaller integers to the vertices, and the second loop assigns the larger integers to the vertices.

8. After assigning the integers, the program prints the assigned integers, the minimum number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of cliques required and assigns the integers to the vertices in each clique.

Correctness: **True**
