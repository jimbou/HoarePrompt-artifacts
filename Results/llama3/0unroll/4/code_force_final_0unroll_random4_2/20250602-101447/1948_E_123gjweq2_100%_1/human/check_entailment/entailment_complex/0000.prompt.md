Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: The array arr has been modified such that for each clique, the elements from i*k to min((i+1)*k-1, n-1) have been set to i+1, where i ranges from 0 to cliques-1. The values of n, k, cliques, and cliquess remain unchanged.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: The elements of the array arr, where each element from i*k to min((i+1)*k-1, n-1) has been set to i+1, with i ranging from 0 to cliques-1
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the number of cliques)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: the elements of the list cliquess

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It then divides the range from 0 to n-1 into cliques of size k, and for each clique, it sets the corresponding elements in the array arr to the clique number (starting from 1). The function prints the modified array arr, the number of cliques, and the list cliquess (which remains unchanged). The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers of size at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of size at least right + 1.
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The values of arr from index left to left + mid - 1 are set to small_element + i, where i ranges from 0 to mid - 1. The values of cliquess from index left to left + mid - 1 are set to clique.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The values of arr from index left to left + mid - 1 are set to small_element + i, where i ranges from 0 to mid - 1. The values of cliquess from index left to left + mid - 1 are set to clique. The values of arr from index left + mid to left + mid + not_mid - 1 are set to big_element - i, where i ranges from 0 to not_mid - 1. The values of cliquess from index left + mid to left + mid + not_mid - 1 are set to clique.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, by assigning specific values to certain ranges of indices. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess`. The function sets the values of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` to `small_element + i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `mid - 1`, and sets the corresponding values of `cliquess` to `clique`. Then, it sets the values of `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` to `big_element - i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, and sets the corresponding values of `cliquess` to `clique`. The function does not return any value.
