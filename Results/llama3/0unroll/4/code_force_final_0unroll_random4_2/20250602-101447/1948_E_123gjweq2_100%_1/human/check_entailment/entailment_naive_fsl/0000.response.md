Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It assigns distinct integers to each vertex and partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to the vertices. It divides the vertices into groups of size k and assigns the integers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques. The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to the vertices in each group.

The program also correctly prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases such as when n is equal to k or when k is greater than n.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
