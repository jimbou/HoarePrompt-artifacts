Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program first calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of `n / k`. It then initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers for each vertex, respectively.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to vertices in each clique. It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. The function assigns integers to vertices in the range `[left, right]` such that the smallest integer is assigned to the vertex at index `left + mid - 1`, and the largest integer is assigned to the vertex at index `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The `cliquess` array is updated accordingly.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `make_array` function ensures that the integers are assigned in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required.

Correctness: **True**
