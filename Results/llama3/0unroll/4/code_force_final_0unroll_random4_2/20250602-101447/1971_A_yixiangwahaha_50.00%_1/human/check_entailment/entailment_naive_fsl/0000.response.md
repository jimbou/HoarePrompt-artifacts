Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that the input will contain a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases, but the program assumes that the number of test cases is always 10. If the number of test cases is not 10, the program will not work correctly.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 9
8 4
1 4

The program will not work correctly because it expects 10 test cases, but there are only 3.
