Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines of two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). It then prints to stdout t lines, each containing the smaller and larger of the corresponding x and y values, separated by a space. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to output the sorted pairs of integers.**
