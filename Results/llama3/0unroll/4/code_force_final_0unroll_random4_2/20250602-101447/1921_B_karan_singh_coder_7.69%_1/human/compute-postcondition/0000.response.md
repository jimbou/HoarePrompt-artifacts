Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each representing the result of a test case. For each test case, if the number of '1's in strings s and t are equal, the output will be the number of '1's in s if the strings are not identical, otherwise it will be 0. If the number of '1's in s and t are not equal, the output will be the difference between the number of '1's in s and t, plus the number of positions where s and t differ, divided by 2.**
