This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings a and b. It then generates a modified binary string by concatenating characters from a and b based on certain conditions. The function prints the modified binary string and a counter value for each test case. The counter value represents the length of the longest contiguous substring where a and b have the same character. The function processes all test cases and consumes the standard input.
