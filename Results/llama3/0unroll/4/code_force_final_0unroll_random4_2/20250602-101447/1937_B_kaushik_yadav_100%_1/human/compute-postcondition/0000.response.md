Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings a_11 a_12 ... a_1n and a_21 a_22 ... a_2n (a_1i and a_2i are either 0 or 1).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The second line reads the first line of the input, which contains the number of test cases. The third line does not affect any variables. The fourth line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
