Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. If M1 is larger than 1, then i is set to 1, cur is set to 0, nums_left is set to L[-1] - i - 1, and ans is updated to (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. If M1 is not larger than 1, then the values of i, cur, nums_left, and ans remain unchanged.**
