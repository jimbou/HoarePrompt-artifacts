Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 2 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to `nums_left` and the value of `L[-1] - 1` to `i`. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is also unchanged, as it still contains several test cases minus one.
