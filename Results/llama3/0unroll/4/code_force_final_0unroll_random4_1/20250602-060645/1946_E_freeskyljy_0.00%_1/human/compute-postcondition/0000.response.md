Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first three inputs to N, M1, and M2, respectively. The second line assigns a list of M1 integers from the second line of the test case to L. The third line assigns a list of M2 integers from the third line of the test case to R. No other variables are affected. After the execution of the code, stdin contains one less test case.
