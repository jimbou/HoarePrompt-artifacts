Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program checks for the necessary conditions and calculates the number of permutations using the math.comb function and modular arithmetic. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
