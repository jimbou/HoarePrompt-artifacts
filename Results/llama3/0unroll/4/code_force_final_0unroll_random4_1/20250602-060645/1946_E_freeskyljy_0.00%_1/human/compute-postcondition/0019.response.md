Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. If M1 is larger than 1, then i is set to 1, cur is set to 0, and ans is updated to (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. nums_left is set to N - R[0] - 1. If M2 is larger than 1, then i is set to N, cur is set to M2, ans is updated to (ans * (L[-1] - 1)! * (N - R[0] - 1)! / (N - R[M2 - 1] - 1)!) % MOD, and nums_left is set to N - R[M2 - 1] - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
