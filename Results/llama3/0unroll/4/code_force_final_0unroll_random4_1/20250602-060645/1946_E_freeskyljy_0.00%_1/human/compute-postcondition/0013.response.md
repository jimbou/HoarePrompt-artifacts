Output State: **i = 1, cur = 0, nums_left = L[-1] - i - 1, ans = (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` is equal to 1, `cur` is equal to 0, `nums_left` is equal to `L[-1] - i - 1`, and `ans` is equal to the product of the initial value of `ans` and the factorial of `L[-1] - 1`, modulo `MOD`.
