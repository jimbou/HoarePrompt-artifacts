Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. If M1 is larger than 1, then i is set to 1, cur is set to 0, and ans is updated to (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. nums_left is set to N - R[0] - 1.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, M2, L, and R remain unchanged. The value of ans is updated based on the value of M1. If M1 is larger than 1, then i is set to 1, cur is set to 0, and ans is updated to (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. The value of nums_left is updated to N - R[0] - 1.
