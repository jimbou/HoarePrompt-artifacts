Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one. The first element of L is 1, the first element of R is N and the last element of L is equal to the first element of R. Additionally, either M1 is 1, or M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.***
