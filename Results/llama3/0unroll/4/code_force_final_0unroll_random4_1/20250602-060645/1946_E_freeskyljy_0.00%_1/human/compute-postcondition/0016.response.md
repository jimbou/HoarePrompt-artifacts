Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, ans is the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements. If M1 is larger than 1, then the current value of i is 1, the current value of cur is 0, and the current value of ans is (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. The current value of nums_left is N - R[0] - 1.**
