You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 0

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns the number of ways to choose L[-1] - 1 elements from N - 1 elements, which is updated based on the values of M1, M2, L, and R. If M1 is larger than 1, the returned value is (ans * (L[-1] - 1)!) % MOD. If M2 is larger than 1, the returned value is (ans * (L[-1] - 1)! * (N - R[0] - 1)! / (N - R[M2 - 1] - 1)!) % MOD.
