Output State: **i = N, cur = M2, ans = (ans * (L[-1] - 1)! * (N - R[0] - 1)! / (N - R[M2 - 1] - 1)!) % MOD, nums_left = N - R[M2 - 1] - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `i` is equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements from `R[0] + 1` to `N`.
*   The value of `cur` is equal to `M2`, indicating that all elements in the list `R` have been processed.
*   The value of `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication of the initial value of `ans` (which is `(L[-1] - 1)!`), and the factorial of the numbers from `N - R[0] - 1` to `N - R[M2 - 1] - 1`, all taken modulo `MOD`. This represents the total number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from the range `[R[0] + 1, N]`, considering the restrictions imposed by the elements in list `R`.
*   The value of `nums_left` is equal to `N - R[M2 - 1] - 1`, indicating the number of elements remaining after the last element in `R` has been processed.
