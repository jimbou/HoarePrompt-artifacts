Output State: **n is 0, stdin is empty, and the standard output contains n lines, each containing a rounded result of the product of the lengths of the diagonals of a rectangle.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has consumed all the input from stdin, and the standard output contains the results of the calculations for each rectangle. The value of n has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
