This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines representing the coordinates of the corners of a rectangle. It calculates the product of the lengths of the diagonals of each rectangle, rounds the result, and prints it to standard output. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the standard output contains the rounded results for each test case.
