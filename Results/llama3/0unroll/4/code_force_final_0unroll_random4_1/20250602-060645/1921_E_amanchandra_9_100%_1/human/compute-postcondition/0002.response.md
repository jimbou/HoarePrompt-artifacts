Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of six integers representing the height and width of a grid, and the positions of two players, Alice and Bob. The function takes no parameters and returns a list of strings indicating the winner of each game, either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', based on the relative positions of the players. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input and outputs the results in the same order.**
