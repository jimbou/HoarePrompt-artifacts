Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), the game is a draw because Alice cannot move down to Bob's row.

2. If the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's rows (abs(a - c)) is even, then Alice can potentially reach Bob's row in the same number of moves as Bob can reach Alice's row. In this case, the program checks if Bob can reach Alice's column (b) within the same number of moves. If Bob can reach Alice's column, then Bob wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

3. If the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's rows (abs(a - c)) is odd, then Alice can potentially reach Bob's row in one more move than Bob can reach Alice's row. In this case, the program checks if Alice can reach Bob's column (d) within the same number of moves. If Alice can reach Bob's column, then Alice wins; otherwise, the game is a draw.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
