Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob. The program first checks if Alice's initial position is below Bob's, in which case the game is a draw. Otherwise, it calculates the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and checks if Bob can move to a position that would allow him to win. If Bob can move to such a position, the program outputs 'Bob', otherwise it outputs 'Alice'. The program also handles the case where the difference in rows between Alice and Bob is even, in which case Bob can move to a position that would allow him to win if and only if the difference in columns is within the range of Bob's possible moves.

Correctness: **True**
