The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first integer in stdin is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). After accepting this integer, the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9.**
