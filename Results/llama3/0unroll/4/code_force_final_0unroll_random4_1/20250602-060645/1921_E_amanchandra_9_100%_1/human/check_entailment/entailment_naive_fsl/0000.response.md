Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column (i.e., b == d) and the distance between them is odd. In this case, the program will incorrectly print "Draw" instead of "Alice" or "Bob".

For example, consider the input:

10 10 1 5 9 5

In this case, Alice and Bob are in the same column (5) and the distance between them is 8, which is even. However, the program will still print "Draw" instead of "Alice" because it does not correctly handle the case when the distance is odd.

To fix this issue, the program needs to add an additional check for the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column and the distance between them is odd.
