Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the ceiling of `n/k` and uses this value to create three lists: `arr`, `cliquess`, and a variable `cliques`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with values in a specific pattern.

The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with values in a way that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. It calculates the midpoint of the range `left` to `right` and fills the first half of the range in `arr` with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` with the value of `clique`. Then, it fills the second half of the range in `arr` with values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` in reverse order, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` with the value of `clique`.

The program prints the values in `arr`, the value of `cliques`, and the values in `cliquess`. The values in `arr` and `cliquess` are the ceiling of `(j/k) + 1` for each index `j`, and the value of `cliques` is the ceiling of `n/k`.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program is correct. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the ceiling of `n/k` and creates the necessary lists, and the `make_array` function correctly fills the lists with values in a way that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

Correctness: **True**
