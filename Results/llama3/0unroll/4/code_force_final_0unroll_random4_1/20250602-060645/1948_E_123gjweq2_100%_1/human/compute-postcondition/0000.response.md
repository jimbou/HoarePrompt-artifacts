Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, and not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces four new variables: `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`. The value of `small_element` is set to `left + 1`, and the value of `big_element` is set to `right + 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` plus 1, divided by 2, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Finally, the value of `not_mid` is calculated as the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1, minus the value of `mid`.
