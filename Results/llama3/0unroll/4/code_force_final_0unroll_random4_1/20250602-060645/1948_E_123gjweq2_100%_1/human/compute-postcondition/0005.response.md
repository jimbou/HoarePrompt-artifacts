Functionality: **This function fills two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with values in a specific pattern. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess`. The function first calculates the midpoint of the range `left` to `right` and then fills the first half of the range in `arr` with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` with the value of `clique`. Then, it fills the second half of the range in `arr` with values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` in reverse order, and the corresponding elements in `cliquess` with the value of `clique`. The function modifies the input lists `arr` and `cliquess` in place.**
