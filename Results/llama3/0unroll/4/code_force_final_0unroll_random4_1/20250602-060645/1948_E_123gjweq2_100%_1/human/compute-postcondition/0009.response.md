Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n/k and uses this value to create three lists: arr, cliquess, and a variable cliques. The function then prints the values in arr, the value of cliques, and the values in cliquess. The values in arr and cliquess are the ceiling of (j/k) + 1 for each index j, and the value of cliques is the ceiling of n/k. The function does not return any values, but rather prints the calculated values.**
