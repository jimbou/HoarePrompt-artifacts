The code prints the elements of the `cliquess` list, which contains the ceiling of `(j/k) + 1` for each index `j`. Since `cliquess` is defined similarly to `arr`, the elements of `cliquess` will be the same as the elements of `arr`.

The ceiling of `(j/k) + 1` for each index `j` can be calculated as follows:

* For `j = 0`, the ceiling of `(0/k) + 1` is 1.
* For `j = 1`, the ceiling of `(1/k) + 1` is 2.
* For `j = 2`, the ceiling of `(2/k) + 1` is 3.
* ...
* For `j = n-1`, the ceiling of `((n-1)/k) + 1` is the ceiling of `n/k`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`, the ceiling of `n/k` will be an integer between 1 and `n`.

Therefore, the `cliquess` list will contain the integers from 1 to the ceiling of `n/k`, repeated `k` times.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., ceiling of n/k (where ceiling of n/k is the ceiling of n/k)**
