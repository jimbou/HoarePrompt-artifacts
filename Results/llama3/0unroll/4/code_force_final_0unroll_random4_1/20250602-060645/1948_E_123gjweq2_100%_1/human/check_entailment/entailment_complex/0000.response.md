Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph and creates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers for each vertex, respectively. The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with values in a specific pattern.

The program's correctness can be evaluated by analyzing its logic and output. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph based on the given formula `cliques = ceil(n / k)`. The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with values in a pattern that ensures the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program's output matches the expected output format, which includes the assigned integers for each vertex, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex. The output values are also consistent with the problem's constraints, such as the assigned integers being distinct and within the range [1, n].

Therefore, based on the program's logic and output, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
