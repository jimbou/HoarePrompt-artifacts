Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required and initializes two arrays: `arr` to store the assigned integers and `cliquess` to store the clique number for each vertex. It then calls the `make_array` function to assign integers to the vertices and partition the graph into cliques.

The `make_array` function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It calculates the small and big elements for the current clique and assigns integers to the vertices in the clique. The integers are assigned in a way that the difference between the vertex number and the assigned integer is minimized, which helps in reducing the number of cliques.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique number for each vertex.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `ceil` function to calculate the number of cliques ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The `make_array` function assigns integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the difference between the vertex number and the assigned integer, which helps in reducing the number of cliques.

Correctness: **True**
