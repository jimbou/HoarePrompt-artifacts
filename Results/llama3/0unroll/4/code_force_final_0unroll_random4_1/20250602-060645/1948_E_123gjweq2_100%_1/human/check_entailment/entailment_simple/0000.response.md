Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to the vertices. It first calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of n/k. Then, it assigns integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. `func_1` calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`. `make_array` assigns integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

The program's output is correct because it assigns distinct integers to each vertex, and the number of cliques is minimized. The output format is also correct, with the first line containing the assigned integers, the second line containing the number of cliques, and the third line containing the clique assignments for each vertex.

Correctness: **True**
