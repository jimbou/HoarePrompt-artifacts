stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to. The second line contains a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input.
