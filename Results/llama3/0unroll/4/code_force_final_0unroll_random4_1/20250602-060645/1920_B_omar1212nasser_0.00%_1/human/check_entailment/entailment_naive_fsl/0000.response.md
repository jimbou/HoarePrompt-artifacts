Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6 6 1 and the array is 3 7 3 3 32 15, the program returns 3, but the correct answer is -5. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where Alice removes the largest elements and Bob multiplies the remaining elements by -1.

In the function func_2, the program only checks if the number of removals is 6 and the number of negatives is 3, and if so, it returns 0. However, this is not a correct solution for all cases. The program should instead calculate the maximum sum of the array after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications.

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the maximum sum of the array after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications. This can be done by iterating over all possible combinations of removals and multiplications, and calculating the sum of the array after each combination. The maximum sum found should be returned as the result.

Here is an example of how the corrected function func_2 could be implemented:

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(removals + 1):
        for j in range(negatives + 1):
            remaining_elements = elements[:-i]
            remaining_elements = remaining_elements[:-j]
            sum = 0
            for k in range(len(remaining_elements)):
                if k < j:
                    sum -= remaining_elements[k]
                else:
                    sum += remaining_elements[k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, sum)
    return max_sum
