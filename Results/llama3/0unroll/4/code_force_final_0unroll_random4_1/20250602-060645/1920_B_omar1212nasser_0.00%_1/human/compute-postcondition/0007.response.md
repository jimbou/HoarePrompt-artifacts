Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum difference between the sum of all elements in a sorted list and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements after a series of 'removals'. It takes three parameters: 'removals' and 'negatives' as non-negative integers, and 'elements' as a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. If 'removals' is 6 and 'negatives' is 3, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iteratively removes elements from the end of the list, updates the sum of all elements and the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, and calculates the difference between these two sums. The function returns the maximum difference found during these iterations.**
