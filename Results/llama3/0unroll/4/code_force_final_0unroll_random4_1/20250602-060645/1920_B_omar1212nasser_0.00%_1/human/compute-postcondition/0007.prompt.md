You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order.
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. Either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3, or both conditions are not met.
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements which are the differences between the sum of all elements and twice the sum of the last negatives elements in the list elements after each removal.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list 'pos', which contains the differences between the sum of all elements and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' after each removal, where 'removals' is a non-negative integer and 'negatives' is a non-negative integer.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the list 'pos', which contains the differences between the sum of all elements and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' after each removal, where 'removals' is a non-negative integer and 'negatives' is a non-negative integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
