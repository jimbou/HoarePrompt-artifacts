Output State: **t is 0, and the sum of every other integer from each test case, starting from the smallest integer, is printed to the console.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the input integers are sorted in ascending order, and the sum of every other integer, starting from the smallest, is calculated and printed to the console. The other variables in the precondition, such as the input test cases, remain unchanged.
