Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a while loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the `2n` integers into a list `A`.
3. It sorts the list `A` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It then prints the sum of every other integer in the sorted list, starting from the smallest integer, using the expression `sum(A[::2])`. This is the key insight: by sorting the list, the program ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, and by summing every other integer, it effectively adds the minimum of each pair to the total score.
5. The program repeats this process for each test case, printing the maximum final score that can be achieved for each case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for achieving the maximum final score. The use of sorting and slicing (`A[::2]`) is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
