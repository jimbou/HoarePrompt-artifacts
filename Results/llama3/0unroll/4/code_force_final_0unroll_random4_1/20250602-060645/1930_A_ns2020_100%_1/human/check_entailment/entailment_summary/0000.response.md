Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing a series of moves on a set of 2n positive integers. The move involves choosing two integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and erasing them from the set. The goal is to maximize the final score after performing the move exactly n times.

The provided program sorts the input integers in ascending order and then calculates the sum of every other integer, starting from the smallest. This approach ensures that the minimum value is always chosen and added to the score, which maximizes the final score.

The program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
