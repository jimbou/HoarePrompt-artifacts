Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the `2n` integers into a list `A`.
3. It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
4. It prints the sum of every other integer from the sorted list, starting from the smallest integer (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is the key step that ensures the maximum final score is achieved.

The reasoning behind this step is as follows:

* By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest integers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.
* By taking every other integer from the sorted list, we effectively pair the smallest integer with the next smallest integer, the third smallest integer with the fourth smallest integer, and so on.
* This pairing strategy ensures that the sum of the minimum values is maximized, because we are always pairing the smallest integer with the next smallest integer.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved by optimally performing the `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
