The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Since the first input is assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). At least one a_i is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). At least one a_i is 1.**
