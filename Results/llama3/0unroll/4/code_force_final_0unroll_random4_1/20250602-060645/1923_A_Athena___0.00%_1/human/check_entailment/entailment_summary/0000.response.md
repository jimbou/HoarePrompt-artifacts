Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of cells `n`, and the cell values `a`.
2.  It iterates over each test case and processes the cell values.
3.  It removes leading and trailing zeros from the cell values by popping elements from the list `a`. This is done to simplify the calculation of the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
4.  After removing leading and trailing zeros, it counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block, as each zero needs to be moved to the left to form a contiguous block of chips.
5.  Finally, it prints the count of zeros for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
