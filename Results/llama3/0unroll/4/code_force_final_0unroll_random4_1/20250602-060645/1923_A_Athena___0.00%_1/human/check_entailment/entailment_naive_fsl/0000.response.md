Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program is not correctly counting the number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.

The issue with the program is that it is only counting the number of zeros in the array after removing the leading and trailing zeros. However, this does not take into account the fact that the chips need to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which can result in more operations than just counting the number of zeros.

For example, in the case of the input 1 0 1 0 1, the program will remove the leading and trailing zeros, resulting in the array [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. It will then count the number of zeros, which is 2. However, the correct answer is 3, because the chip in the third position needs to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which is the second position, and then the chip in the fifth position needs to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which is the third position.

Therefore, the program is not correct and the Correctness is **False**.
