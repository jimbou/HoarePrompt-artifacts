Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

Explanation:
The code reads an integer T from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). This value is assigned to the variable T. The remaining input in stdin consists of t-1 test cases, each containing two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k, where 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The variable T now holds the value of the first integer read from stdin, and the remaining input in stdin is reduced by one test case.
