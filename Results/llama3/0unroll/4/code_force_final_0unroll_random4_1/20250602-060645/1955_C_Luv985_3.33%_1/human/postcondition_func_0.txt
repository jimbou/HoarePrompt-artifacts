This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then attempts to make pairs of elements in the array equal to 0 using k operations, where each operation can subtract 1 from two elements. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be made equal to 0 using k operations.
