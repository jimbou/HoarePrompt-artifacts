Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'No' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water for each container. It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference becomes negative, the program returns 'No' because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

If the program iterates through all containers without finding a negative difference, it returns 'Yes' because it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. Therefore, the program is correct.
