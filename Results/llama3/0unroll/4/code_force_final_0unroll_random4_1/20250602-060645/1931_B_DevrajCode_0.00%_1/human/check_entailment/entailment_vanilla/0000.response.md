Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `n` and the amounts of water in each container `a`.

2. The program defines a function `func_1(n, a)` that takes the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water `a` as input.

3. Inside the function, the program calculates the total amount of water `total_water` by summing up all the elements in the list `a`.

4. The program then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If it's not, the function returns 'No', indicating that it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

5. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water `target` for each container by dividing the total amount of water by `n`.

6. The program then initializes a variable `container` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative difference between the actual amount of water in each container and the target amount.

7. The program iterates over the list `a` and for each container, it adds the difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount to the `container` variable.

8. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, the function returns 'No', indicating that it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. This is because a negative `container` value means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

9. If the program completes the iteration over the list `a` without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Based on this analysis, the program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
