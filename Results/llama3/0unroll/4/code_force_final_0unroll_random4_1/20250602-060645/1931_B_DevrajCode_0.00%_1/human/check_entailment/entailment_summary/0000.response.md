Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute water evenly among n containers by checking if the total amount of water is divisible by n and if the water can be redistributed from left to right without needing to pour water from a container to a previous one.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by n. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. Then, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have and iterates over the list of water amounts. For each container, it subtracts the target amount from the current amount and adds the result to a running total (container). If this total ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it returns 'No'. If it finishes iterating over the list without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating that the water can be evenly distributed.

Correctness: **True**
