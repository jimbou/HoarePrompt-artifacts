Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'No', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of the water in each container is divisible by the number of containers.

2. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total `container`.

4. If at any point the running total `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program finishes iterating over the containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Therefore, the program returns 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**
