Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute water evenly among n containers, given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of water in each container.

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total (called `container`).

4. If at any point the running total becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, which means it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.

5. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

This solution is correct because it takes into account the constraint that water can only be poured from a container to a container that is to its right. The running total `container` effectively keeps track of the amount of water that needs to be poured into the current container from the previous containers, and if this amount ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container.

Correctness: **True**
