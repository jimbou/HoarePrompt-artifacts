Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, which is divisible by `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_water` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list `a`. Since the sum of the elements in `a` is initially divisible by `n`, the value of `total_water` is also divisible by `n`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
