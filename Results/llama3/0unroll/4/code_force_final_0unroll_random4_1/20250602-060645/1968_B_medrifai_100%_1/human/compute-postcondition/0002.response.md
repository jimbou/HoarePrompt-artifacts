Output State: **The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from the index `j`.**

In this output state, `a[i]` is a character from the binary string `a` at index `i`, and `b` is another binary string. The index `j` is a non-negative integer that represents the starting point of the search for `a[i]` in `b`. The returned value is the sum of `j` and the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`, which is the position of `a[i]` in the string `b` relative to the starting point `j`.
