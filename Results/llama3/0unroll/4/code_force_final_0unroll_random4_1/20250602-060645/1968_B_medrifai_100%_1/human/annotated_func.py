#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(a) and 0 <= j < len(b).
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from the index `j`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for the first occurrence of a character from a binary string `a` within a substring of another binary string `b`, starting from a specified index `j`, and returns the index of the found character if it exists, or -1 if not found.
