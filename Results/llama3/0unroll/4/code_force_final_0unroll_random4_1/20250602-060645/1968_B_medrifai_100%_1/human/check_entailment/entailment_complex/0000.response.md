Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b. The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings a and b, and a helper function func_1 to find the index of the first occurrence of a character from a in a substring of b, starting from a specified index j.

The program correctly initializes the variables i, j, and c to keep track of the current indices in strings a and b, and the count of matching characters, respectively. The while loop condition checks if j is less than m (the length of string b) and i is less than n (the length of string a), ensuring that the loop does not go out of bounds.

Inside the loop, the program calls the func_1 function to find the index of the first occurrence of a[i] in b[j:]. If the character is found, the program updates j to the index of the found character plus one, increments i and c, and continues the loop. If the character is not found, the program breaks out of the loop.

The func_1 function correctly searches for the first occurrence of a character from a in a substring of b, starting from a specified index j, and returns the index of the found character if it exists, or -1 if not found.

The program correctly prints the value of c, which represents the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
