Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. If it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together, it returns `None`.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the total minimum number of tents needed. It first calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals together, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` and returns the total.

The program uses the `ceil` function from the `math` module to round up the division result to the nearest integer, which is necessary because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, such as when there are not enough universals to fill the tents with extroverts.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
