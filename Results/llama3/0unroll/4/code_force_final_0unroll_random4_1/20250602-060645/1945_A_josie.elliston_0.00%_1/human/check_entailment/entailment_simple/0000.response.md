Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given Python program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve this problem.

`func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3. If it's not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the average of the sum of extroverts and universals.

`func_2` calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as arguments and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
