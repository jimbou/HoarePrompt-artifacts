Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**

In this output state, the values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The variable `ret` is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The return value of `func_1` is not specified, so `ret` can take any value that `func_1` returns based on its internal logic.
