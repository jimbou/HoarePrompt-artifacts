Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, under certain conditions. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the average of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals`.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers (`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1` called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.

The program correctly implements the logic to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If this condition is not met, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and adds the number of introverts to get the total number of tents.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
