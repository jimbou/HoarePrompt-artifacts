Functionality: **This function calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, under certain conditions. If extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the average of the sum of extroverts and universals.**
