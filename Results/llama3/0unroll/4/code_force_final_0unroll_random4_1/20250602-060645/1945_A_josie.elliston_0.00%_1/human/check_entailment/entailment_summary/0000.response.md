Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Function func_1 calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the average of the sum of two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, under certain conditions. If extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the average of the sum of extroverts and universals.

Function func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of func_1 called with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The execution summaries of the functions demonstrate that they behave as expected. Function func_1 correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, and function func_2 correctly adds the number of introverts to this result. If it is impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the wishes, func_2 returns -1.

Correctness: **True**
