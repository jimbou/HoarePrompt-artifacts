Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, and `func_2` adds the number of introverts to this result.

The logic of the program is sound. It first checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If it is not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the universals. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using the ceiling of the division of the total number of extroverts and universals by 3.

The program then adds the number of introverts to this result, as each introvert needs a separate tent.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals, and it returns the correct minimum number of tents needed in each case. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
