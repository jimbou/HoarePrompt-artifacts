#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer.
    l = len(arr)

    #The program returns the difference between the last element of the list 'arr' and the element at the index calculated by max(-n, -1 - times) from the end of the list 'arr'. The index is determined by the maximum of -n and -1 minus 'times', where 'times' is a non-negative integer and 'n' is the number of elements in 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the difference between the last element of a list and the element at a specific index from the end, determined by the maximum of the negative list length and -1 minus a given non-negative integer, and returns this difference.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer.

    #State: The final state of the variables after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: s1 remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, pre remains unchanged, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, and ans is a list of length n containing the calculated values based on the conditions inside the loop.

    #This is printed: The list of calculated values of length n based on the conditions inside the loop

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1, where each value is determined by the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function takes a string s1 as input and returns a list of calculated values of the same length as the input string. The input string s1 remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
