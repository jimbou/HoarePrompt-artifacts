Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a pinball moving on a one-dimensional grid according to certain rules. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 calculates the difference between the last element of a list and the element at a specific index from the end, determined by the maximum of the negative list length and -1 minus a given non-negative integer.

Function func_2 calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1, where each value is determined by the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string.

The program uses these functions to process the input string s1 and calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed at each cell. The calculated values are then printed as output.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The functions work together to calculate the desired output values based on the input string.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be concluded that the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
