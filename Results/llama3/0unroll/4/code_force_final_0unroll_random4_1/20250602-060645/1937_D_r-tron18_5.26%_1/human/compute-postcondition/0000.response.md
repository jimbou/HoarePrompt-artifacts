Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of pre starting from 0, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros**.

In this final state, the code has processed the string s1 and extracted the indices of '>' characters into the list pre. The total number of '>' characters is stored in totalOne. The list preOne contains the cumulative sums of the indices in pre, starting from 0. The list suffZero contains a single element 0, and the list ans is initialized with n zeros. The original string s1 and the positive integer n remain unchanged.
