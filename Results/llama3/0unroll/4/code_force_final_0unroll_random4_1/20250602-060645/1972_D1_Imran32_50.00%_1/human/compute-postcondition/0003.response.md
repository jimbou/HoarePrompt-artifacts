The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i)` integer divided by `i` squared for `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.

Here, `n` is a positive integer, and `root` is an integer equal to the square root of `n` plus 1. The sum is calculated for each `i` from 2 to `root`, and the result is added to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **n + sum of (n + i) / i^2 for i from 2 to sqrt(n) + 1 (where n is a positive integer)**
