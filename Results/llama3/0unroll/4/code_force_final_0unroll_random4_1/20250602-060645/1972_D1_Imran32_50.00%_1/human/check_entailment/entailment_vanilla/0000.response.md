Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program is incorrect. The function `func_1()` is not correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

The program is trying to calculate the sum of the number of multiples of each number from 2 to the square root of n, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and check if the conditions are satisfied. However, this would be inefficient and would not meet the time complexity requirements of the problem.

A more efficient approach would be to use the concept of greatest common divisor (gcd) and the fact that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). This can be used to reduce the number of iterations and make the solution more efficient.

However, the given program does not implement this approach correctly, and therefore it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
