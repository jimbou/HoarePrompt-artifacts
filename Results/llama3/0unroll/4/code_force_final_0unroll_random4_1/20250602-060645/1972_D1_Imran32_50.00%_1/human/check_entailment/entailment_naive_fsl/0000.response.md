Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The problem statement requires that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), but the program does not take this into account.

The program seems to be calculating the number of divisors of n, which is not related to the problem statement. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem.

For example, if we take the input n = 10 and m = 8, the program will output 14, but the correct output should be 14 (as mentioned in the example output). However, if we take the input n = 10 and m = 9, the program will output 15, but the correct output should be 16.

The program is not correctly implementing the conditions mentioned in the problem statement, and therefore, it is incorrect.
