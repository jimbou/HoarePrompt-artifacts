Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program is not correctly implementing the solution. The program is calculating the sum of n and the sum of (n + i) integer divided by i squared for i from 2 to the square root of n plus 1, which is not related to the problem.

The correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of a and b, calculating the gcd(a, b), and checking if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The program does not do this.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
