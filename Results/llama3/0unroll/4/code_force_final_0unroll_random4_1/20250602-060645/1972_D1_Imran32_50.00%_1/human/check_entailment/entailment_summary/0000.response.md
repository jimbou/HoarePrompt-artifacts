Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. However, upon examining the program, it becomes apparent that it does not accurately address the problem statement.

The program defines a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments but uses the variables `n` and `k` from the input. It calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and then prints this value. The calculation involves iterating over a range from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1, adding to `ans` the sum of `n` and `i` divided by `i` squared.

However, the problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions: `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`. The program does not correctly implement this logic.

The execution summary indicates that the program calculates and prints a value based on `n` and then consumes the next test case from standard input. This behavior does not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, based on the provided program and its execution summary, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
