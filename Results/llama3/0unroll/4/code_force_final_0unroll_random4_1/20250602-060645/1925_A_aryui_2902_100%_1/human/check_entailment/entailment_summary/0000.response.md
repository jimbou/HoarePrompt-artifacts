Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it correctly implements the required logic to generate a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. The program takes two positive integers n and k as input, and returns a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet, repeated n times. This ensures that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of the generated string.

Correctness: **True**
