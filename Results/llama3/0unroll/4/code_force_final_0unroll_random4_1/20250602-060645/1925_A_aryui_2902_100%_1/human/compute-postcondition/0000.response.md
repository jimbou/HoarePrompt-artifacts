Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 26, k is a positive integer between 1 and 26, s is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of the two positive integers from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains two inputs, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of these inputs. The second line assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to `s`. 

After the code executes, `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 26, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Stdin is now empty, as the two inputs have been consumed by the `input()` function.
