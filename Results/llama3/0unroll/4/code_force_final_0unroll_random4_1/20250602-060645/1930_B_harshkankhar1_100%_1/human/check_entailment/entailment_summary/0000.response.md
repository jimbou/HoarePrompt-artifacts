Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The program achieves this by generating a list of integers from 1 to n and then reversing every other element in the list. This approach ensures that no two consecutive elements in the list have a divisor relationship, satisfying the problem's condition.

Correctness: **True**
