Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the input number of test cases, with every other element in reverse order, stdin contains a list of integers (the length of the permutations)**

The first line assigns a list of integers from 1 to the input number of test cases to `a`. The second line reverses every other element in the list `a`, starting from the first element. The input number of test cases is still in stdin, but it is no longer needed as it has already been used to create the list `a`. The list of integers (the length of the permutations) is still in stdin, unchanged.
