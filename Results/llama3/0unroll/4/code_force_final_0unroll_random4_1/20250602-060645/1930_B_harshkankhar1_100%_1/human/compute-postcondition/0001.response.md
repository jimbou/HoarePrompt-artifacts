Based on the precondition, the list `a` contains integers from 1 to the input number of test cases, with every other element in reverse order. The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Since the exact number of test cases is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list of integers with every other element in reverse order.

Output: **a list of integers from 1 to the input number of test cases, with every other element in reverse order**
