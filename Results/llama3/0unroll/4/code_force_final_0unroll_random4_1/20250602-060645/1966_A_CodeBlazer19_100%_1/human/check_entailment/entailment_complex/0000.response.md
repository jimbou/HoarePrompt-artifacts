Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of cards, and the exchange value for each test case.

2. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each card number and stores them in the list `p`.

3. It then checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to the exchange value `k`. If it is, it prints `k - 1`, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left after exchanging. This is because we can always exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k - 1` cards of any number.

4. If the maximum count of any card number is less than `k`, it prints `n`, which is the total number of cards. This is because we cannot exchange any cards in this case, so the minimum number of cards left is the total number of cards.

5. The program repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
