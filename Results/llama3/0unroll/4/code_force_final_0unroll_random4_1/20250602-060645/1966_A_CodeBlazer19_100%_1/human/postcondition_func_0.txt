This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers, then determines the maximum count of any integer in the list. If the maximum count is greater than or equal to k, it prints k - 1; otherwise, it prints n. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases (t) and outputs a list of results, one for each test case.
