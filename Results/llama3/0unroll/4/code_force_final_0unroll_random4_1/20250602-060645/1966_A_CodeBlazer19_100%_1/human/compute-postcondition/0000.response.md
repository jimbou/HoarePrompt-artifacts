The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, which is between 1 and 500, and then `t` test cases. After the execution of the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 2 <= `k` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= `c_i` <= 100).**
