Output State: `ans` is an integer equal to the number of elements in the list `a` that are two positions away from an element in the set `present`, minus 2, plus the sum of all gaps in the list `gaps` that are greater than or equal to twice the value of `y`, plus twice the value of `y` if there is a gap in the list `gaps` that is less than twice the value of `y`, `gaps` is a sorted list of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in the list `a`, wrapped around to the start of the list after the last element.
