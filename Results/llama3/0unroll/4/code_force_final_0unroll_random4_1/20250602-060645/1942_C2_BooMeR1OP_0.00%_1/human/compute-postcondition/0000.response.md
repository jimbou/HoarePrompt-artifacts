Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

This output state reflects the combined effect of all lines in the code snippet. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, x, and y, respectively. The second line reads x distinct integers from stdin, subtracts 1 from each, and stores them in the list a. The list a is then sorted in ascending order. The set present is created from the list a, containing the same x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1. Finally, the variable ans is assigned the value of x - 2. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two lines have been consumed from the input.
