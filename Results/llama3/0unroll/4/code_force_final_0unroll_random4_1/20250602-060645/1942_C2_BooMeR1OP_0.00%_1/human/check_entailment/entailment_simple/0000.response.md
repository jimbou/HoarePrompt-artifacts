Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It then sorts the list of chosen vertices `a` and creates a set `present` to keep track of the vertices that have been chosen.
3. The program then iterates over the list `a` and checks if the vertex two positions ahead of the current vertex is in the set `present`. If it is, it increments the answer `ans` by 1. This is because a triangle can be formed with the current vertex, the vertex two positions ahead, and the vertex in between.
4. The program then calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices in the list `a` and stores them in the list `gaps`. It also sorts the list `gaps` in ascending order.
5. The program then iterates over the list `gaps` and checks if the current gap is less than or equal to the remaining number of vertices `y` that can be chosen. If it is, it increments the answer `ans` by the current gap and decrements `y` by the number of pairs that can be formed with the current gap. If the current gap is greater than `y`, it increments `ans` by 2 times `y` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Finally, the program prints the answer `ans`.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly implements the greedy approach to solve the problem. The program's time complexity is O(x log x) due to the sorting of the list `gaps`, where x is the number of chosen vertices. The program's space complexity is O(x) for storing the list `gaps` and the set `present`.

Correctness: **True**
