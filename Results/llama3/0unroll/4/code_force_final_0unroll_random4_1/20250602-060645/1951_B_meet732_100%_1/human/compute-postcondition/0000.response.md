Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to a_k, ind is an empty list, c is 0.**

The code assigns the value of `a[k]` to `x`, which means `x` will be the kth element of the list `a`. The list `ind` is initialized as an empty list, and the variable `c` is set to 0. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, with `n` and `k` still being integers and the list of `n` integers still being present.
