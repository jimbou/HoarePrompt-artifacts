Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the second index in the list 'ind' minus 1 and 'k' minus 1, where 'k' is an integer between 1 and 'n', and 'n' is an integer between 2 and 10^5.**

In this output state, the value returned by the program is the minimum of two values: `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`. The value of `ind[1]` is an index in the list `ind` that contains more than one index `i` such that `a_i > x`, where `x` is an integer equal to `a_k`. The value of `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5.
