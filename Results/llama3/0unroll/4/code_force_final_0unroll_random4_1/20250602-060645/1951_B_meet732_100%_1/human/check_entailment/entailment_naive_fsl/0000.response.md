Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the maximum number of wins, but it does not correctly handle all possible cases.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the cow's rating is the highest among all cows, but it is not in the first position. In this case, the program should return `n-1` (the maximum number of wins), but it does not.

For example, if the input is `n=5, k=3, a=[1, 2, 10, 3, 4]`, the program will return `2`, but the correct answer is `4`. This is because the cow with rating `10` can win all matches if it is swapped with the cow in the first position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.
