Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the first index in `ind` minus 1 and the difference of the second index in `ind` minus the first index in `ind`.**

In this output state, `ind` is a list containing more than one index `i` such that `a_i > x`, where `x` is an integer equal to `a_k`. The first element of `ind` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `k` is greater than the second element of `ind`. The returned value is the maximum of two differences: the difference between the first index in `ind` and 1, and the difference between the second index in `ind` and the first index in `ind`.
