Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
3. The program initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year when the nth sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by dividing the current `start_year` by the periodicity of the sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by the periodicity of the sign. This effectively calculates the next year when the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
5. After iterating over all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the nth sign occurs.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads input, calculates the start year for each test case, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
