Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the provided periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a loop that runs for each test case.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the next sign is expected to occur.

4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the next occurrence of the sign is expected. This is done by the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

   - `start_year + 1` is used to ensure that the next occurrence of the sign happens strictly after the current year.
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates the number of times the sign has occurred up to the current year.
   - `+ 1` increments this count to get the number of times the sign should have occurred for the next expected occurrence.
   - `* nums[x]` multiplies this count by the periodicity of the sign to get the year of the next expected occurrence.

5. The program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
