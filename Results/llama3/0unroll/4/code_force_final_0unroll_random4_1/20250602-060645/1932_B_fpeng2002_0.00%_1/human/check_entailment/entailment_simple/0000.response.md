Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:
	* `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates the number of times the sign has occurred so far, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
	* Adding 1 to this result gives the number of times the sign will occur in the future.
	* Multiplying this result by `nums[x]` gives the year when the sign will occur next.
5. The program updates `start_year` with the calculated next year when the sign will occur.
6. After iterating over all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the apocalypse will happen.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
