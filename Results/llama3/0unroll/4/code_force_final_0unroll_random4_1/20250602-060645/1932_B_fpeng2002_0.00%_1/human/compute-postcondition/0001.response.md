Output State: **num_tests is 0, and the last calculated start_year is printed to the console.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has finished executing all test cases, and the number of remaining tests (`num_tests`) is now 0. Additionally, the final calculated `start_year` value for the last test case is printed to the console. The state of other variables, such as `n` and `nums`, is not retained after each iteration, as they are reinitialized in each iteration of the loop.
