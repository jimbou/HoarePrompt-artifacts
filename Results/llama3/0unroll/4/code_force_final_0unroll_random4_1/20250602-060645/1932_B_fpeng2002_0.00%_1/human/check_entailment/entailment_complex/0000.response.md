Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and then reads `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
3. The program initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the `n` integers, updating the `start_year` variable for each sign. The update formula is `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which correctly calculates the year in which the next sign occurs, taking into account the periodicity of the previous sign.
5. After updating the `start_year` variable for all `n` signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the update formula for `start_year` is correct. Therefore, the program produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
