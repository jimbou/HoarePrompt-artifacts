Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the sign periodicities are large or small, and cases where the number of signs is large or small. The use of integer division and multiplication to update the start year ensures that the program avoids floating-point precision issues.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of signs is 1, in which case the start year is simply the periodicity of the single sign.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
