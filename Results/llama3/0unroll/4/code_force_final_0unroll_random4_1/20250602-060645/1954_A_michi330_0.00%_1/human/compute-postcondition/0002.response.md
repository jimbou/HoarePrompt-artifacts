Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, m, and k. It then determines whether it is possible to satisfy a certain condition based on these values, printing 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case provided in the input, printing a corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case.**
