The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). After reading the first integer, the stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).**
