Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program takes into account the number of parts (n), the number of colors (m), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (k).

The program's logic is based on the condition that if n is less than or equal to k, or if the number of parts that cannot be repainted to have the same color (n - math.ceil(n / m)) is less than k, then Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In all other cases, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way.

The program correctly implements this logic using a simple if-else statement, and it correctly handles the input and output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
