Output State: The loop will execute 'a' times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read a line from stdin, parse two integers 'b' and 'c', and print 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After the loop finishes, the state of 'a' will be unchanged, but 't-1' lines will have been read from stdin. The values of 'b' and 'c' will be the last pair of integers read from stdin. The output will contain 'a' lines, each containing one of the four possible strings.
