Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks three conditions:

1. If b (the number of moves) is equal to c (the number of cubes), it prints 'YES' because it is possible to build a tower with c cubes in c moves.

2. If b is less than c, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If b is greater than c, it checks if b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes' because it is possible to build a tower with c cubes in b moves. If they do not have the same parity, it prints 'No' because it is not possible to build a tower with c cubes in b moves.

This logic is correct because the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move, so the parity of the number of cubes must remain the same. Therefore, if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity, it is possible to build a tower with that number of cubes in that number of moves.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
