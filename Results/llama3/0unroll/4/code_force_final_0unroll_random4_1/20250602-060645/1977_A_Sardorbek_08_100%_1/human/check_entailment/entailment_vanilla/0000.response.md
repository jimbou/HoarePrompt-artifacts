Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (b) is equal to the number of cubes (c), it prints 'YES'.
2. If the number of moves (b) is less than the number of cubes (c), it prints 'NO'.
3. If the number of moves (b) and the number of cubes (c) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the program is incorrect. The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. This condition only checks if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity, but it does not consider the actual number of moves required to build the tower.

For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 3`, the program will print 'Yes' because `b % 2 == c % 2`, but it's not possible to build a tower with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves.

Correctness: **False**
