This function reads an integer 't' from the standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers 'n' and 'm', and prints 'YES' if 'n' equals 'm', 'NO' if 'n' is less than 'm', 'Yes' if 'n' and 'm' have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables.
