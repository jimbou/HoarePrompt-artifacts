Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program works by iterating over each test case, reading the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m), and then applying the following logic:

- If n is equal to m, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put n cubes on top of the tower.
- If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
- If n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with m cubes by putting n cubes on top and then removing the excess cubes.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with m cubes.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
