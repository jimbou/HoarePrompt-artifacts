Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m), it prints "YES" because Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower n times.
2. If the number of moves (n) is less than the number of cubes (m), it prints "NO" because Nikita cannot obtain a tower with m cubes in less than m moves.
3. If the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints "Yes" because Nikita can obtain a tower with m cubes by putting one cube on top of the tower n times, with some moves being wasted by removing a cube and then putting it back.
4. If the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) do not have the same parity, it prints "No" because Nikita cannot obtain a tower with m cubes in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
