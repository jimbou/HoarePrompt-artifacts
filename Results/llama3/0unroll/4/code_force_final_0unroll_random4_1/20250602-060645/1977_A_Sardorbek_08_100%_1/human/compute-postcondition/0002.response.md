Output State: **The loop will execute 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read two integers 'b' and 'c' from the standard input, and print 'YES' if 'b' is equal to 'c', 'NO' if 'b' is less than 'c', 'Yes' if 'b' and 'c' have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), and 'No' otherwise. The state of 'a' remains unchanged after the loop execution.**
