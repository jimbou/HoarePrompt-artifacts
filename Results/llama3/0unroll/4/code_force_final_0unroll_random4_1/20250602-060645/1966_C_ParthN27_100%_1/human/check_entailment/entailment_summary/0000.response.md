Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program first removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set, then sorts the unique elements. It then checks the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. If the number of unique elements is 2, or if the XOR of the differences between consecutive elements (excluding the first element) is 1, the program outputs 'Alice' as the winner. Otherwise, it outputs 'Bob'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
