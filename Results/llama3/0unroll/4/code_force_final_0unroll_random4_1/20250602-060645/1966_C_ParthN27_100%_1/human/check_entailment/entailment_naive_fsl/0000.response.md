Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the answer. The program sorts the unique elements of the array and then checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it is, the program breaks the loop and prints 'Alice' if the answer is 1, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. However, this approach is incorrect.

The correct approach is to find the minimum element in the array and then check if the bitwise XOR of all elements minus the minimum element is 0. If it is, then 'Bob' wins, otherwise 'Alice' wins.

For example, if the input is [2, 2, 3, 3], the program will print 'Alice', but the correct answer is 'Bob'. This is because the minimum element is 2, and the bitwise XOR of all elements minus the minimum element is 0 (2^2^3^3 = 0), which means 'Bob' wins.
