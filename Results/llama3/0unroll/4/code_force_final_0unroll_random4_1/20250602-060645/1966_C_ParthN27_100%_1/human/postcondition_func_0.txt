This function determines the winner of a game based on a set of integers. It takes a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n space-separated positive integers. The function processes each test case by removing duplicates, sorting the numbers, and then checking the differences between consecutive numbers. If the number of unique elements is 2, or if the XOR of the differences between consecutive numbers (excluding the first element) is 1, the function outputs 'Alice' as the winner. Otherwise, it outputs 'Bob'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and prints the winner for each case.
