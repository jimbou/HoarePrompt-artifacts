Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The output will be 'Alice' if the number of elements in the set s is 2, or if the XOR of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list s (excluding the first element) is 1. Otherwise, the output will be 'Bob'.**
