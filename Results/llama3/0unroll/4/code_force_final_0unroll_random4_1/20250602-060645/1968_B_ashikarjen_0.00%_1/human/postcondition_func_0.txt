This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) and two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively. It then calculates and prints the length of the longest common subsequence of a and b. The function does not modify the input values t, n, m, a, and b.
