Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0.**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, consuming the first two integers and two binary strings. The values of n and m are set to the first two integers, and the binary strings a and b are assigned to the next two inputs. The variables k and j are initialized to 0. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.
