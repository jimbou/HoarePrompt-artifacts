Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

4. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - `ans2`: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion, where the number of pairs of yogurts is `n // 2` and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2).

5. The program then prints the minimum cost between `ans1` and `ans2`.

6. If n is 1, the program simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).

7. The program correctly handles the cases where n is 1 and where n is greater than 1, considering the promotion and the regular price.

8. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
