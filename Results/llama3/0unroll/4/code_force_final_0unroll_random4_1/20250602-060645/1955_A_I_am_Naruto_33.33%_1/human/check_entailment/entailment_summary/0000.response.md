Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. If n is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion, which is the cost of buying n//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b * n // 2) plus the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2).
4. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
5. If n is 1, it simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

This logic correctly implements the problem description and should produce the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
