Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is 1, it simply prints the regular price a.
* If n is greater than 1, it calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
