Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates two values, ans1 and ans2, based on the input values, and prints the minimum of these two values. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of a. The function does not modify the input values and produces t lines of output, each containing the calculated minimum value or the value of a for n=1.**
