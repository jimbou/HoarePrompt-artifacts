Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program iterates over the number of test cases, reads the input for each test case, and calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is 1, in which case the minimum cost is simply the price of one yogurt (a). For n greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs: ans1, which is the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n), and ans2, which is the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of the min function ensures that the program always prints the minimum cost, regardless of whether the promotion price or the regular price is more advantageous.

Correctness: **True**
