Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values t, n, a, and b from the standard input.
2. For each test case, it calculates two values: ans1 (the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price) and ans2 (the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price).
3. The program correctly calculates ans1 as a * n, which is the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price.
4. The program correctly calculates ans2 as b * n // 2 + a * n % 2, which is the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price. The expression n // 2 calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and n % 2 calculates the remaining yogurt that needs to be bought at the regular price.
5. The program correctly prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2, which is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.
6. If n is 1, the program correctly prints the value of a, which is the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it produces the correct output for the given input values.

Correctness: **True**
