Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is correct and works as expected.

`func_2` is the main function that takes a string as input and checks if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. The function first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, the function prints 'YES', 1, and the original string. This is correct because a single substring that is not a palindrome meets the problem's requirements.

If the entire string is a palindrome, the function then checks if there is a character in the string that is different from the first character. If no such character exists, the function prints 'NO' because the string cannot be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. This is also correct.

If a character different from the first character exists, the function checks if the substring from that character to the end is not a palindrome. If it's not, the function prints 'YES', 2, and the string partitioned into two substrings. This is correct because the partitioned substrings meet the problem's requirements.

If the substring from the character to the end is a palindrome, the function checks if the index of the different character is 1 or half the length of the string. If it is, the function prints 'NO' because the string cannot be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. This is correct.

If the index of the different character is not 1 or half the length of the string, the function prints 'YES', 2, and the string partitioned into two substrings, but this time including the next character. This is correct because the partitioned substrings meet the problem's requirements.

In all cases, the function correctly determines if the string can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
