Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. This function is used as a helper function in `func_2`.

`func_2` is the main function that takes a string `s` as input and checks if it can be divided into two parts based on certain conditions. If the string consists of the same character repeated, it prints 'NO'. If the string can be divided into two parts, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the two parts of the string. If the string cannot be divided into two parts, it prints 'YES', the number 1, and the original string.

The program uses a loop to iterate over the input string and checks if the first character is the same as the current character. If it finds a mismatch, it sets the index `x` to the current index and breaks the loop. If `x` is still -1 after the loop, it means that the string consists of the same character repeated, and the program prints 'NO'.

If `x` is not -1, the program checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`. If it is not a palindrome, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the two parts of the string. If the substring is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is 1 or `n//2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If `x` is 1 or `n//2`, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the two parts of the string.

The program uses a for loop to iterate over the input strings and calls `func_2` for each string.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program seems to be correct. It correctly identifies whether a string can be divided into two parts such that each part is not a palindrome and prints the appropriate output.

Correctness: **True**
