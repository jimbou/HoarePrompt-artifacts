Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the input string.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

2. `func_2` first checks if the entire input string is not a palindrome. If it's not, the function prints "YES", 1, and the original string, which is a valid partition.

3. If the entire string is a palindrome, the function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, the function prints "NO", indicating that there is no valid partition.

4. If a different character is found, the function checks if the substring starting from the next character is not a palindrome. If it's not, the function prints "YES", 2, and the partitioned strings.

5. If the substring starting from the next character is a palindrome, the function checks if the index of the different character is 1 or half the length of the string. If it is, the function prints "NO", indicating that there is no valid partition.

6. If the index of the different character is not 1 or half the length of the string, the function prints "YES", 2, and the partitioned strings, but with an additional character in the first partition.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. However, there is a small issue in the last step of `func_2`. When the index of the different character is not 1 or half the length of the string, the function should print the partitioned strings with only one additional character in the first partition, not two. This is because the problem statement requires each substring to be not a palindrome, and adding two characters would result in a palindrome.

Correctness: **False**
