The code prints the substring of `s` from the beginning to the index `x + 1` (inclusive), followed by a space, and then the substring of `s` from the index `x + 1` to the end.

Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`, the substring `s[:x + 1]` will contain all characters that are the same as the first character of `s`, and the substring `s[x + 1:]` will contain all characters that are different from the first character of `s`.

Output: **the substring of s from the beginning to the index x + 1 (inclusive), followed by a space, and then the substring of s from the index x + 1 to the end**
