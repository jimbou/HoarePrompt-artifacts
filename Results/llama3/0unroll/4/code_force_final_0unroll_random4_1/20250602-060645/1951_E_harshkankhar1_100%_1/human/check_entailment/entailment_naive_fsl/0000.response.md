Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string has a length of 2 and is a palindrome (e.g., "aa"). In this case, the program should output "NO", but it outputs "YES" with a partition of 2 substrings, which is incorrect.

Here's why:

* The program checks if the entire string is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it's not a palindrome, it outputs "YES" with a partition of 1 substring, which is correct.
* If the entire string is a palindrome, it checks if the first character is different from the rest of the string using `s[i] != s[0]`. If it finds a different character, it sets `x` to the index of that character.
* If `x` is still -1 after the loop, it means all characters are the same, and the program outputs "NO", which is correct.
* However, if `x` is not -1, the program checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. If it's not a palindrome, it outputs "YES" with a partition of 2 substrings, which is correct.
* But if the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, and `x` is 1 or `n//2`, the program outputs "NO", which is correct.
* However, if `x` is not 1 or `n//2`, the program outputs "YES" with a partition of 2 substrings, which is incorrect for the case when the input string has a length of 2 and is a palindrome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
