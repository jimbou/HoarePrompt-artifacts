Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string s is printed in two parts: the first part is from the start of the string to the index x (inclusive), and the second part is from the index x + 1 to the end of the string. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is either 1 or n divided by 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are printed.***
