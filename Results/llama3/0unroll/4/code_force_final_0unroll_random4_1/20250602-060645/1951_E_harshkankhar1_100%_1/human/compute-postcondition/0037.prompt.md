You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

If x is either 1 or n divided by 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are printed.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string s is printed in two parts: the first part is from the start of the string to the index x (inclusive), and the second part is from the index x + 1 to the end of the string. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is either 1 or n divided by 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of s remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, the value of n remains the length of s, and the value of x remains -1. The function func_1(s[0:]) remains False, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string s has been printed.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, 'NO' is printed, and the value of x remains -1, indicating that no character in string s is different from the first character of s.

Case_3: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, and x is not equal to -1. The current value of func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the string s is printed in two parts: the first part is from the start of the string to the index x (inclusive), and the second part is from the index x + 1 to the end of the string

Case_4: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, func_1(s[0:]) returns True, x is not equal to -1, func_1(s[x + 1:]) returns True, and x is neither 1 nor n // 2, and 'YES' is being printed, and 2 is being printed, and the first x + 2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
