Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to achieve a score of 10 with a maximum of 10 games (each game can result in a maximum of 2 points).

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly check if the scores are consistent with any valid set of games and results. The program only checks if the sum of the scores is even and if the maximum score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores. However, it does not check if the scores can be achieved with a non-negative number of games.

For example, in the case of 1 1 10, the program does not check if it is possible to achieve a score of 10 with a maximum of 10 games. It simply outputs 2, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
