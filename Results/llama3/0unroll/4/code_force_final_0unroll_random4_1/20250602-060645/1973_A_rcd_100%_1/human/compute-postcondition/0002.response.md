Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then processes each test case and prints the result, which can be either -1 (if the sum of the scores is odd), the sum of the first two scores (if the third score is greater than or equal to the sum of the first two), or the sum of the first and third scores (if the third score is less than the sum of the first two and certain conditions are met). The function continues this process until all test cases have been read and processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
