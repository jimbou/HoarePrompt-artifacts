Output State: **The output state will contain the results of each test case, which will be either -1, the sum of p1 and p2, or the sum of p1, p2, and p3, depending on the conditions in the loop. The value of t will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The stdin will be empty as all the test cases have been read and processed.**
