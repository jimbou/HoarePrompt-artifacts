Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains x lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, containing x lines each with two space-separated integers x and y, where x and y are between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
