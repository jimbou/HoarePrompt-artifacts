Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and the subsequent t lines each contain two space-separated integers x and y. It then prints the input pairs in a specific order, ensuring that the first integer in each pair is greater than or equal to the second integer. The function does not modify the input values or the value of t, and it only performs printing actions without returning any values.**
