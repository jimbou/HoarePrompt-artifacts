Output State: **The output will contain x lines, each containing two space-separated integers. In each line, the first integer will be greater than or equal to the second integer. The value of x will be the number of lines in the input, but its value will not be used in the loop. The loop will iterate x times, but the value of x will not be changed. The loop will only print the input values in a specific order, without modifying the value of x.**
