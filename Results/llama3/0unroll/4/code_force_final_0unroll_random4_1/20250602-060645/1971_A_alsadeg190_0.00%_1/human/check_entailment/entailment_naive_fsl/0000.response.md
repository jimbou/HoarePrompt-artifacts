Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input values of x and y are equal. In such cases, the program will print the values in the order they are input, rather than printing the minimum followed by the maximum. For example, if the input is "3 3", the program will print "3 3" instead of the correct output "3 3". 

However, the problem description requires the program to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. In the case of equal inputs, the minimum and maximum are the same, so the program should print the same value twice. But the program does not handle this case correctly. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
