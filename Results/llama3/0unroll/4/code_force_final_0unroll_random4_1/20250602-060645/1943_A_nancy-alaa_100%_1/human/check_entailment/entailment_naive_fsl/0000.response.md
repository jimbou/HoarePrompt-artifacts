Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score. The strategy is to first check if there is a number that appears only once in the array, and if so, Alice should choose that number. If not, Alice should choose the smallest number that appears more than once. This is because Bob's goal is to minimize the score, so he will try to remove the smallest number that appears more than once.

The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If it finds a number that is not in the Counter, it means that number does not appear in the array, so it prints that number as the score. If it finds a number that appears only once, it sets a flag to True. If it finds a number that appears more than once and the flag is True, it means that Alice has already chosen a number that appears only once, so it prints that number as the score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when there are multiple numbers that appear only once, when there are no numbers that appear only once, and when the array is empty. Therefore, the program is correct.
