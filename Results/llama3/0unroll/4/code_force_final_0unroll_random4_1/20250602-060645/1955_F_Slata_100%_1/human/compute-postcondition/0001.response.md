Functionality: **This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. It calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of these integers by 2, with an additional 1 added to the sum if the remainders of three of the integer divisions by 2 sum up to 3. This calculation is repeated for each line of input, with the results printed out one per line.**
