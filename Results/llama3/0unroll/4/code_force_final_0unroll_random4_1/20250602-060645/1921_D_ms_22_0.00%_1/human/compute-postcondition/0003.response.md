Postcondition: ***The program processes multiple test cases from stdin, where each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. If the program is run as the main module, it initializes variables t, n, m, a, b, max_heap, tp1, tp2, and ans to 0, 0, 0, empty lists, empty lists, empty lists, 0, -1, and 0, respectively. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
