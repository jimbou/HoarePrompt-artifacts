The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the program is being run as the main module and stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains the number of test cases `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, and the standard input still contains the remaining test cases, with each test case having two lines: the first line with two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line with `n` integers `a_i`, and the third line with `m` integers `b_i`.
