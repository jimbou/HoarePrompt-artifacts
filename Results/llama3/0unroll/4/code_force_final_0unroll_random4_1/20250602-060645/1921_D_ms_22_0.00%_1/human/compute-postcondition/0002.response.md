Output State: **t = 0, n = 0, m = 0, a = [], b = [], max_heap = [], tp1 = 0, tp2 = -1, ans = 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `m` are also 0, as they are reinitialized to 0 at the beginning of each test case. The lists `a` and `b` are empty, as they are reinitialized to empty lists at the beginning of each test case. The max heap `max_heap` is also empty, as it is reinitialized to an empty list at the beginning of each test case. The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are 0 and -1, respectively, indicating that they have reached the end of the lists `a` and `b`. The answer `ans` is 0, indicating that the minimum sum of absolute differences has been calculated and printed for all test cases.
