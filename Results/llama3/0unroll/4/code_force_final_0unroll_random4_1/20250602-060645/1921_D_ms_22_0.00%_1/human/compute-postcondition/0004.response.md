Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between each a_i and its closest element in the sorted array b_i, considering the constraints that the closest element must be within the range [tp1, tp2] and updates the range boundaries tp1 and tp2 accordingly. The function prints the minimum sum of absolute differences for each test case.**
