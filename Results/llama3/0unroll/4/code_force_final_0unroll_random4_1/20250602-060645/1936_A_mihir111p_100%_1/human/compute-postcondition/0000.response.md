Based on the precondition, the variables a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than a positive integer n. When the print statement is executed, it will print a string '?' followed by the values of a, b, c, and d.

Since the exact values of a, b, c, d, and n are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)**
