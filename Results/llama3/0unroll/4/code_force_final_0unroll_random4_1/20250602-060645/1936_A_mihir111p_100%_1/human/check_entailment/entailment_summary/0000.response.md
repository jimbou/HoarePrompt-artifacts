Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a function func_1 to ask queries in the format '? a b c d' and get the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d).

The program first finds the index ans1 such that p_ans1 is the maximum among all p_i. It does this by comparing p_i with p_ans1 for each i and updating ans1 if p_i is greater.

Then, it finds the indices v such that p_v is equal to p_ans1. It does this by comparing p_i with p_ans1 for each i and adding i to v if they are equal.

Finally, it finds the index ans such that p_ans XOR p_ans1 is maximized among all p_v. It does this by comparing p_v with p_ans for each v and updating ans if p_v XOR p_ans1 is greater.

The program prints the result in the format '! ans ans1'.

The execution summary shows that the function func_1 prints a string in the format '? a b c d' and returns a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the values of a, b, c, and d. This is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
