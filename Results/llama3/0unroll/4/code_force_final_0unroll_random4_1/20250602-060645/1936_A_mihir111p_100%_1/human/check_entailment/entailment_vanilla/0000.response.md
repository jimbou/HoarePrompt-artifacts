Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of the numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The program uses a query function `func_1` to ask the jury for comparisons between the bitwise OR of pairs of numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the index `ans1` such that `p_ans1` is the maximum among all `p_i`. This is done by iterating over all indices `i` and comparing `p_i` with `p_ans1` using the query function. If `p_i` is greater than `p_ans1`, `ans1` is updated to `i`.

2. Next, the program finds the index `mx` such that `p_mx` is the minimum among all `p_i` that have the same maximum value as `p_ans1`. This is done by iterating over all indices `i` and comparing `p_i` with `p_mx` using the query function. If `p_i` is less than `p_mx`, `mx` is updated to `i`. If `p_i` is equal to `p_mx`, `i` is added to the list `v`.

3. The program then finds the index `ans` such that `p_ans ⊕ p_ans1` is maximized among all `p_i` in the list `v`. This is done by iterating over all indices `i` in `v` and comparing `p_i ⊕ p_ans1` with `p_ans ⊕ p_ans1` using the query function. If `p_i ⊕ p_ans1` is greater than `p_ans ⊕ p_ans1`, `ans` is updated to `i`.

4. Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.
