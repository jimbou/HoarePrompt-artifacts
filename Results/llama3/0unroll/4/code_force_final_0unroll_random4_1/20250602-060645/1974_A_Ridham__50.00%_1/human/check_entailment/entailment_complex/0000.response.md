Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to accommodate a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. The program takes into account the space requirements for both types of icons and the remaining cells available on the screen.

The program first calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons, which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons. It then calculates the number of screens required to accommodate these icons, which is the ceiling of the total space required divided by 15 (the total number of cells on a screen).

Next, the program calculates the remaining cells available on the screen after accommodating the 2x2 icons. If the number of 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining cells, the program simply adds the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.

However, if the number of 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining cells, the program calculates the extra space required to accommodate these icons. It then calculates the number of additional screens required to accommodate this extra space, which is the ceiling of the extra space divided by 15. The program adds this number to the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons and appends the result to the output list.

The program repeats this process for each input pair and finally prints out the calculated number of screens required for each pair, one per line.

Correctness: **True**
