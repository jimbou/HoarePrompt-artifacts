Functionality: This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate the corresponding input values of x and y for each test case, considering the space requirements for x and y, and the remaining cells available on the screen. The function then prints a list of n integers, each representing the number of screens required for each test case, separated by newline characters.
