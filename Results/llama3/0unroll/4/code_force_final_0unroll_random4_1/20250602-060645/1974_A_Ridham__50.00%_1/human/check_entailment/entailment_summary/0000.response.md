Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. The program accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It takes into account the space requirements for both types of icons and the remaining cells available on the screen. The program handles different scenarios correctly, including cases where the number of 2x2 icons is even or odd, and where the remaining cells are sufficient or insufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons. The execution summary also confirms that the program produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
