This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains two integers x and y. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate the given x and y values, taking into account the space requirements for both x and y, and the remaining cells available on the screen. The function then prints out the calculated number of screens required for each input pair, one per line.
