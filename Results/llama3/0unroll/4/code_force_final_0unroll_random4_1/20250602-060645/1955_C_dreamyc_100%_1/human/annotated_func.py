#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers.
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns a positive integer n, which is the number of elements in the list 'nums'.
    #State: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers. The sum of the elements in nums is larger than k
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is a non-negative integer, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums.
    return ans
    #The program returns a non-negative integer ans.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum number of elements that can be selected from a list of positive integers such that the sum of the selected elements does not exceed a given target value k. If the sum of all elements in the list is less than or equal to k, the function returns the total number of elements in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of elements that can be selected from the start and end of the list without exceeding k/2 and returns the total count.
