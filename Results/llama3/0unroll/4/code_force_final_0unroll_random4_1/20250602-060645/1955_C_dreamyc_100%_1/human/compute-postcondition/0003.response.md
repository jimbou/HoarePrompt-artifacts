Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced new variables `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b` and assigned them specific values. The value of `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k/2`. The value of `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, which means it is the largest integer less than or equal to `k/2`. The variables `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b` are initialized to 0.
