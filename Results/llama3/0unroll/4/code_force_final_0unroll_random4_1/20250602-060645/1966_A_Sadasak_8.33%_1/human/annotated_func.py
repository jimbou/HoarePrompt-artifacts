#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and the length of arr is less than or equal to 100.

    #State: Output State: The frequency_table dictionary contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, but with a maximum frequency of k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns the frequency_table dictionary, which contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, but with a maximum frequency of k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified maximum value k. The function takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the list and the values are their respective frequencies, limited to a maximum of k. The original list and the value of k remain unchanged.
