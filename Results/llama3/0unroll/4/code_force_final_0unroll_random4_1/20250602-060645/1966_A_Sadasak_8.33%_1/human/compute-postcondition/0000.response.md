Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is less than or equal to 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, and the length of `arr` is still less than or equal to 100. The code introduces a new variable `frequency_table`, which is initialized as an empty dictionary.
