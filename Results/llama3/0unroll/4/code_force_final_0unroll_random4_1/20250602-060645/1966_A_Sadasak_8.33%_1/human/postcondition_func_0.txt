This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified maximum value k. The function takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the list and the values are their respective frequencies, limited to a maximum of k. The original list and the value of k remain unchanged.
