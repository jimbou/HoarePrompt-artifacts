Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of an array equal, based on the values of n and k. The function handles three cases: when k is 1, when k is less than or equal to 2n, and when k is greater than 2n. For each test case, it prints the calculated result on a separate line.**
