Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell. The program handles different cases based on the value of k.

If k is 1, the program prints 1, which is correct because coloring one cell will cover one diagonal.

If k is less than or equal to 2n, the program prints the ceiling of k/2, which is correct because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and there are 2n diagonals in total.

If k is greater than 2n, the program prints k//2 + 1, which is correct because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and there are k//2 diagonals that need to be covered, plus one more cell to cover the remaining diagonals.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
