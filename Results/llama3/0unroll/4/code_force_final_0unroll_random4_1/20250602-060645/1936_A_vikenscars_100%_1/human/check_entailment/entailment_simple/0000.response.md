Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the secret sequence `p`.

In the `func_2` function, the program first finds the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` by comparing each element with the current maximum using `func_1`. This is done in a loop that runs `n-1` times, resulting in at most `n-1` queries.

Next, the program finds the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` that is not equal to the maximum item found in the previous step. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum using `func_1`, and if the comparison result is '=', the program compares the element with itself using `func_1` to determine if it is the maximum item. This loop also runs `n` times, resulting in at most `n` additional queries.

Finally, the program prints the indices of the two maximum items found in the previous steps.

The total number of queries made by the program is at most `2n-1`, which is less than the allowed `3n` queries. Therefore, the program is correct and should be able to find the desired indices `i` and `j` within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
