Based on the precondition, the code prints a formatted string containing the value of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. 

`max_item_idx` remains unchanged, and its value is not explicitly provided in the precondition. Therefore, its value is described as the value of `max_item_idx`.

`pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`. Since the exact values of `func_1` and `n` are not provided, the value of `pair_idx` is described as the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [the index of the maximum item in the range [0, n) as determined by func_1]**
