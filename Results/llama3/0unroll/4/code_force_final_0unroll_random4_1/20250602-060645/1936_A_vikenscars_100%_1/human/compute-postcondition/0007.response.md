Output: **`pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`, `max_item_idx` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `func_1` remains unchanged, and this is printed: "! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]" where [max_item_idx] is the value of max_item_idx and [pair_idx] is the value of pair_idx**
