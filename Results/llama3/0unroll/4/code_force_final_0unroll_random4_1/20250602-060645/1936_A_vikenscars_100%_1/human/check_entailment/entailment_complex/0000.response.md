Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i` XOR `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a comparison function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the secret sequence.

Function `func_1` takes four non-negative integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'. This function is used to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the secret sequence.

Function `func_2` uses `func_1` to find the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` and then finds the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`. It then prints the indices of these two maximum items.

The program assumes that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `func_1` is a correctly implemented comparison function. The program also assumes that the secret sequence `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct if all its functions together meet the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
