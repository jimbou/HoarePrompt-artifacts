Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`, `n` remains unchanged, `func_1` remains unchanged, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` is assigned the value of `max_item_idx`, which is the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n)` as determined by `func_1`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `n`, and `func_1` remain unchanged.
