This function determines the index of the maximum item in a secret sequence p using a comparison function func_1, and then finds the index of the maximum item in the range [0, n) as determined by func_1. It prints the indices of these two maximum items. The function takes no parameters and returns no value, but it modifies the external state by printing the result. The function assumes that n is a positive integer greater than 1, and func_1 is a correctly implemented comparison function.
