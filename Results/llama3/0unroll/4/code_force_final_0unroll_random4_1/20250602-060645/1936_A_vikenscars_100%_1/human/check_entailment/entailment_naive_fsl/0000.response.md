Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to make queries and `func_2` to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

In `func_2`, the program first finds the index of the maximum item in the sequence by comparing each item with the current maximum item. This is done using the `func_1` function to make queries and determine the maximum item.

Once the maximum item is found, the program then finds the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It does this by comparing the maximum item with each other item in the sequence, and if the XOR value is greater than the current maximum XOR value, it updates the pair of indices.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices with the same maximum XOR value, as it will return any one of them.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
