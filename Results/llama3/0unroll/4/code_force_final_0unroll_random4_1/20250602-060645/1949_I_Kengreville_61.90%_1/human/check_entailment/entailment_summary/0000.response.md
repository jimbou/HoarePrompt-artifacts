Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of disks in a plane such that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. The `func_1` function reads the input data, initializes the necessary variables, and performs a loop over all disks. For each disk, it checks if the disk has not been visited before and, if so, calls the `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search on the graph of disks.

The `dfs` function updates the coefficients for unvisited nodes based on their distances and radii and recursively calls itself for adjacent unvisited nodes. The coefficients are used to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner.

The program prints 'YES' if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner and 'NO' otherwise.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the necessary logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly reads the input data, initializes the necessary variables, and performs the necessary loop over all disks. The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients for unvisited nodes and recursively calls itself for adjacent unvisited nodes.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
