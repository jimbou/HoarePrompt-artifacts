Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

First sample (left) and a valid way to change the radii of the disks (right).

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of boolean and integer values respectively of length n, nodes is a list of integers.

        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer equal to its input value, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef0 is a list of n None values, coef1 is a list of n None values, nodes is an empty list
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []

            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer equal to its input value, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef0` is a list of `n` integers, `coef1` is a list of `n` integers, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is True if at least one `coef1` value is not zero, False otherwise.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer equal to its input value, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef0` is a list of `n` integers, `coef1` is a list of `n` integers, `nodes` is an empty list. If at least one `coef1` value is not zero, `ok` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ok` is False and 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a graph represented by a list of nodes with their x, y coordinates and radius contains at least one node with a non-zero coefficient. The function takes no input parameters and returns no values, but instead prints 'YES' if such a node exists and 'NO' otherwise. It modifies the input lists by setting all visited nodes to True and calculates the coefficients for each node.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a non-negative integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: The loop iterates n times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current node j is not visited and if the distance between nodes i and j is equal to the sum of their radii. If both conditions are true, it updates the coefficients coef0 and coef1 for node j and calls the dfs function recursively. After the loop finishes, the visited list remains unchanged, the nodes list remains unchanged, the x, y, and r lists remain unchanged, and the coef0 and coef1 lists are updated for the nodes that were visited during the loop. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being the updated coef0 and coef1 lists.
    #State: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a non-negative integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If the current node i is not visited, the function updates the coefficients coef0 and coef1 for the nodes that were visited during the loop and calls the dfs function recursively. If the current node i is visited, the state remains unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being the updated coef0 and coef1 lists for the nodes that were visited during the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, updating coefficients for unvisited nodes based on their distances and radii, and recursively calls itself for adjacent unvisited nodes, ultimately returning the updated coefficients for all visited nodes.
