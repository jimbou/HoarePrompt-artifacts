Determines whether a graph represented by a list of nodes with their x, y coordinates and radius contains at least one node with a non-zero coefficient. The function takes no input parameters and returns no values, but instead prints 'YES' if such a node exists and 'NO' otherwise. It modifies the input lists by setting all visited nodes to True and calculates the coefficients for each node.
