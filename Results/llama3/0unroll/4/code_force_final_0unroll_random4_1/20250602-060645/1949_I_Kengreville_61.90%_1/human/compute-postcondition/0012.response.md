Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to its input value, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef0` is a list of `n` integers, `coef1` is a list of `n` integers, `nodes` is an empty list. If at least one `coef1` value is not zero, `ok` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ok` is False and 'NO' is printed.***
