Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a non-negative integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If the current node i is not visited, the function updates the coefficients coef0 and coef1 for the nodes that were visited during the loop and calls the dfs function recursively. If the current node i is visited, the state remains unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being the updated coef0 and coef1 lists for the nodes that were visited during the loop.***
