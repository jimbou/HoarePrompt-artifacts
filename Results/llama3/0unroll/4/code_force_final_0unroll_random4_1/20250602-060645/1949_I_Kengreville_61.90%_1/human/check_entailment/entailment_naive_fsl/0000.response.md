Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program handles the coefficients (coef0 and coef1) in the dfs function. The program assumes that the coefficients are always updated correctly, but this is not the case.

In the dfs function, the program updates the coefficients of the neighboring nodes based on the current node's coefficients. However, this update is not correct when the neighboring node is already visited. In such cases, the program should not update the coefficients of the neighboring node, but it does.

This incorrect update can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider a graph where node A is connected to node B, and node B is connected to node C. If the program visits node A first, it will update the coefficients of node B. Then, if the program visits node B, it will update the coefficients of node C. However, if the program visits node C before node B, it will not update the coefficients of node C correctly, because node B's coefficients are not yet updated.

To fix this issue, the program should keep track of the nodes that are currently being visited in the dfs function, and only update the coefficients of the neighboring nodes if they are not already visited.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2

In this case, the program will output "NO", but the correct output is "YES". The program fails to find a valid way to change the radii of the disks because of the incorrect update of the coefficients in the dfs function.
