Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, expecting multiple lines of input. It first reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, and calculates the maximum sum of n numbers that can be obtained by choosing a and b as the first two numbers and then selecting the remaining numbers from the range [a, b] to maximize the sum. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case, resulting in t lines of output, each containing a single integer.**
