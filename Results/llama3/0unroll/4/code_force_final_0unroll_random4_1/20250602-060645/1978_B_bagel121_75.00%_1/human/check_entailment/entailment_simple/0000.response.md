Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). If this is the case, it means that selling all buns at the usual price will result in the maximum profit, so it simply prints n * a.
3. If a is less than b, it calculates the optimal value of k (the number of buns to be sold at a modified price) as min(b - a + 1, n). This is because the price of the i-th bun to be sold at a modified price is (b - i + 1), so the maximum price that can be obtained is b - a + 1. However, k cannot be greater than n, so it takes the minimum of these two values.
4. It then calculates the total profit obtained by selling the first k buns at a modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k. This is correct because the prices of the buns form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -1.
5. Finally, it adds the profit obtained by selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price (a) to the total profit and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
