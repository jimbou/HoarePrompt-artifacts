The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The input contains multiple lines, with the first line containing an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After reading the first line, the remaining lines contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**
