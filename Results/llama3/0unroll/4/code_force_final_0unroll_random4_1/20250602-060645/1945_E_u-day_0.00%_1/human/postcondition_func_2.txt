This function determines the position of a target value k in a list of distinct integers arr. It first finds the index of k in arr and then uses a binary search approach to find the first occurrence of k. If k is found at the predicted position, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the actual position of k and the predicted position. The function does not modify the input list arr or the values of n and k.
