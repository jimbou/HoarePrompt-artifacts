Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads input and splits it into integers, `func_2` converts the input into a list, and `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.

2. In `func_3`, the program first reads the input values `n` and `k` using `func_1`, and then reads the permutation array `arr` using `func_2`.

3. It then finds the position `pos` of the target value `k` in the array `arr`.

4. The program initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes an empty set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited.

5. The program enters a while loop that continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of `low` and `high`, adds `mid` to the set `st`, and updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.

6. After the loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and then prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the positions that need to be swapped.

7. The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed, but according to the problem statement, it is guaranteed that 2 operations are always sufficient, and the program is designed to find a solution that works, not necessarily the optimal solution.

8. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from compiling or running correctly.

Correctness: **True**
