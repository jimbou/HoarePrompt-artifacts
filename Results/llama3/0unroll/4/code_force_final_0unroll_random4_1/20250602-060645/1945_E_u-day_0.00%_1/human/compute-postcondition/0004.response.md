Output State: **low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, high is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is unchanged, n is unchanged, k is unchanged, arr is unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: After the loop finishes executing, the variables 'low' and 'high' will both point to the index of the first occurrence of 'k' in the array 'arr'. The set 'st' will contain the indices of all elements in 'arr' that are greater than 'k'. The variables 'pos', 'n', 'k', and 'arr' remain unchanged.
