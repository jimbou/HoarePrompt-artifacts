Output State: **low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set, pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, n is unchanged, k is unchanged, arr is unchanged**

The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, and sets them to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. It also creates an empty set called `st`. The values of `pos`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
