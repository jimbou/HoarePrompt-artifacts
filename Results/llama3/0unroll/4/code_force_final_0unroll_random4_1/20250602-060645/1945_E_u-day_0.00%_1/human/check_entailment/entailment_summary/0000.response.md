Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation of integers. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, the value at the predicted position is equal to the target value x.

The program consists of multiple functions, but the main function is func_3(). This function reads the input, finds the position of the target value k in the permutation, and then uses a binary search approach to find the first occurrence of k. If k is found at the predicted position, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the actual position of k and the predicted position.

The program does not modify the input list or the values of n and k. It only prints the number of operations performed and the positions involved in the operations.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program meets the requirements. It correctly determines the position of the target value k in the permutation and prints the number of operations performed and the positions involved.

Correctness: **True**
