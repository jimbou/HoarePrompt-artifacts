The code prints the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. 

`low` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, but since the element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`, `low` is not the actual index of `k`. Instead, it is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. 

`pos` is unchanged, which means its value is not affected by the previous operations. 

Since `1` is being printed, it indicates that `low` and `pos` are both equal to `0`, because `0 + 1` equals `1`. 

Therefore, the output will be the value of `low + 1` which is `1` and the value of `pos + 1` which is also `1`.

Output: **1, 1**
