Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

The code snippet executes the functions func_1() and func_2() and assigns their return values to the variables n, k, and arr, respectively. The variable pos is initialized to -1. Since the functions func_1() and func_2() return the values of n, k, and arr, which are already defined in the initial state, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only new information is the value of pos, which is set to -1.
