Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the number to be found is at the position that is not the result of the binary search. For example, if the input is:

6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6

The binary search will result in low = 2, but the number 3 is at position 1. The program does not handle this case correctly. It only checks if the number at the low position is equal to the target number, but it does not check if the number is at a different position.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to check if the number is at a different position and swap the numbers if necessary.
