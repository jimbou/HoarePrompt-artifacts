Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the target element `k` in the permutation `arr`. The program first finds the index `pos` of the target element `k` in the permutation `arr`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the index `low` of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

Correctness: **True**
