This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then concatenates the binary strings in a specific order, based on the values of the strings, and prints the concatenated string. Additionally, it counts the maximum consecutive occurrences of '1's in the concatenated string and prints this count. The function processes all test cases and produces the concatenated strings and maximum consecutive '1' counts as output.
