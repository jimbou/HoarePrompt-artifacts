#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: The value of res is the number of distinct non-negative integers in list a, count is a dictionary where keys are the distinct non-negative integers in list a and values are all 0, and the value of n remains unchanged.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of distinct non-negative integers in list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns the number of distinct non-negative integers in the list, while also modifying the input list by creating a dictionary where keys are the distinct non-negative integers and values are all 0.
