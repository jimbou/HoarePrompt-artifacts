Output State: **The output state is a series of print statements, each containing either a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!) followed by four space-separated integers. The number of print statements is equal to the number of test cases (t) multiplied by the number of iterations of the inner loops (which is n-1 for the first inner loop and n-1 for the second inner loop). The integers in each print statement are the values of the variables v1, v1, v2, v2, or prev, v1, i, prev, depending on the iteration of the inner loops. The final print statement for each test case contains an exclamation mark (!) followed by the values of prev and v1.**
