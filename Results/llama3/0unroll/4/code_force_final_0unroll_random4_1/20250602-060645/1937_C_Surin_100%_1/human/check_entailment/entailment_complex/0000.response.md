Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program first finds the index v1 that has the maximum value among all p_i by comparing each p_i with p_0. Then, it finds the index prev that has the minimum value among all p_i by comparing each p_i with p_v1. Finally, it prints the indices prev and v1 as the result.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the results are correctly parsed.

The program also correctly handles the case where n = 2, in which case it simply prints the indices 0 and 1 as the result.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
