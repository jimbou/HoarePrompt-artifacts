Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 10^3), followed by t test cases. Each test case contains one integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin.**

The code defines two lambda functions, `I` and `R`, which are used to read input from stdin. The `I` function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers using the `split` method with a space character as the separator, and maps each string to an integer using the `map` function. The `R` function reads a single integer from stdin. 

The initial state of stdin remains unchanged, as the code only defines functions to read input but does not actually read or modify the input. The functions `I` and `R` are now available for use in subsequent code to read input from stdin.
