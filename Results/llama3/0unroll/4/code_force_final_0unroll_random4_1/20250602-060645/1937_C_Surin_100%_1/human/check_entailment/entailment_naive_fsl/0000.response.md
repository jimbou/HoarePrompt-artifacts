Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

The program first finds the index v1 of the maximum value in the permutation p by comparing each pair of elements (v1, v1) and (i, i) for i from 1 to n-1. This is done using the query "? v1 v1 i i" and checking the result.

Once v1 is found, the program then finds the index prev of the maximum value in the permutation p that is different from v1. This is done by comparing each pair of elements (v1, i) and (v1, prev) for i from 1 to n-1 and checking the result. If the result is '>', it means that (v1, i) is greater than (v1, prev), so prev is updated to i. If the result is '=', it means that (v1, i) is equal to (v1, prev), so the program checks if (i, i) is less than (prev, prev) using the query "? i i prev prev". If the result is '<', it means that (i, i) is less than (prev, prev), so prev is updated to i.

Finally, the program prints the pair of indices prev and v1 as the answer.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly handles the case where n is 2, in which case the program simply prints the pair of indices (0, 1) as the answer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and uses the allowed queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
