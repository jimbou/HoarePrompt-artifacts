Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer (n) representing the number of elements. For each test case, it performs a series of comparisons and prints the results in the form of question marks (?) or exclamation marks (!) followed by four space-separated integers. The function ultimately prints the values of two variables, prev and v1, for each test case, which represent the result of the comparisons. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly to the standard output.**
