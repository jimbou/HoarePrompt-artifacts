Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n is 2, the program prints "MM", but according to the problem description, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. In the string "MM", both 'M's are equal to each other, so there are 2 special characters, not 2. 

A correct solution would be to print "NO" for n = 2, because there is no string of length at most 200 that has exactly 2 special characters.
