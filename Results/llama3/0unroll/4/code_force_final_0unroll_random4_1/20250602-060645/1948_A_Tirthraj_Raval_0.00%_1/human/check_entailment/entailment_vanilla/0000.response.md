Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description.
2. The problem description states that we need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
4. Inside the function, it reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
5. The function then iterates over each test case using a for loop.
6. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of special characters required in the string.
7. The function then checks if `n` is odd using the modulo operator (`n % 2 == 1`). If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case.
8. If `n` is even, the function prints 'YES' and constructs a pattern of characters to create a string with exactly `n` special characters.
9. The pattern is constructed by iterating over the range of `n // 2` and appending 'A' and 'B' characters to the pattern list in an alternating manner.
10. The function then joins the pattern list into a string using the `join()` method and prints the resulting string.
11. The function repeats this process for each test case.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the pattern of characters to create a string with exactly `n` special characters. The current implementation only alternates between 'A' and 'B' characters, which does not guarantee that the resulting string will have exactly `n` special characters.

For example, if `n` is 6, the program will output the string "ABABAB", which has only 3 special characters (at positions 1, 3, and 5), not 6.
