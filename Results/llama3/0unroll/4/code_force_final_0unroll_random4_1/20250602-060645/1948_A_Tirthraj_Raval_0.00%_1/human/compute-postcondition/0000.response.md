The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and then `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50). 

Since `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 50, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 50. The stdin now contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**
