Output State: **The loop has executed 'a' number of times, each time printing the maximum number of characters that can be matched between the two binary strings 'd' and 'e' from left to right, considering only the first occurrence of a character in 'e' for each character in 'd'. The values of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' have been updated 'a' number of times, with 'b' and 'c' being the lengths of the strings 'd' and 'e' respectively, and 'd' and 'e' being the binary strings themselves. The variable 'k' has been reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and updated based on the matching characters. The stdin has been consumed 'a' number of times, with each consumption consisting of two integers and two binary strings.**
