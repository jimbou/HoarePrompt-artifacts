Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers and two binary strings. It then finds the maximum number of characters that can be matched between the two binary strings from left to right, considering only the first occurrence of a character in the second string for each character in the first string. The function prints this maximum number of matched characters for each test case.**
