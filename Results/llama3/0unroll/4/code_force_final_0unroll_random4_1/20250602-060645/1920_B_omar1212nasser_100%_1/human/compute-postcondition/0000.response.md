Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* The initial state remains valid for `removals` and `negatives` as they are not modified by the code.
* The list `elements` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
* A new list `pos` is created and initialized with one element, which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. This is calculated using the expression `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
* The variable `s` is assigned the sum of all elements in `elements`.
* The variable `s2` is assigned the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Note that the code does not modify the original list `elements`, but rather creates new variables and lists that depend on its values.
