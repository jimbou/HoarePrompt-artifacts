Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game strategy described in the problem statement. 

In the first function, it reads the input, sorts the list of integers in ascending order, and calls the second function to calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained after Alice's removals and Bob's negations. It repeats this process for each test case and prints the result.

The second function calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by considering different removals of elements from the end of the sorted list and subtracting twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements. It correctly updates the sum of the remaining elements and the sum of the last 'negatives' elements after each removal, and it returns the maximum sum obtained.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where 'removals' or 'negatives' is 0, and it correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained in each case.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
