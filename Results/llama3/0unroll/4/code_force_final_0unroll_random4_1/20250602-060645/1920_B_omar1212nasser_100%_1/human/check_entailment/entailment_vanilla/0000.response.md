Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`.

3. It then reads the array of elements `a` and sorts it in ascending order.

4. The program defines a function `func_2` that takes the number of removals `k`, the number of negatives `x`, and the sorted array of elements `a` as input.

5. Inside `func_2`, it calculates the sum of the elements `s` and the sum of the last `x` elements `s2`. It then appends the difference `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`.

6. The program then iterates from 1 to `k` (the number of removals). In each iteration, it subtracts the last element from `s` and `s2`, and if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of the array, it adds the element at index `-(negatives + i)` to `s2`. It then appends the difference `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`.

7. Finally, the program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the maximum sum of elements after the game.

8. The main function `func_1` calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It considers all possible scenarios of removals and negations, and returns the maximum sum of elements after the game.

Correctness: **True**
