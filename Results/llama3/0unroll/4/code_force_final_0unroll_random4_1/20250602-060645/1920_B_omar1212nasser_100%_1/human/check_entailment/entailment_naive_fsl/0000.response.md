Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game strategy described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  The program first sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to determine the optimal removals and negations.
2.  The `func_2` function calculates the maximum possible sum after the game by considering all possible removals and negations. It does this by iterating over the range of possible removals and calculating the sum of the remaining elements after negating the largest elements.
3.  The program correctly handles the edge case where the number of removals or negations is 0, in which case the sum remains unchanged.
4.  The program also correctly handles the case where the number of removals or negations is equal to the length of the array, in which case the sum becomes 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game strategy and calculates the maximum possible sum after the game.
