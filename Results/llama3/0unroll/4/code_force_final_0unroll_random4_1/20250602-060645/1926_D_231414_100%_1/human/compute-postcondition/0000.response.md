Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, times is an integer equal to the first input of the test case, check is 2147483647**

In this code snippet, the first line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `times`. This means that the first input of the test case, which is an integer, is consumed and stored in the variable `times`. As a result, stdin now contains one less test case.

The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This is a constant value, which is the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer. This value is 2147483647.

Since the code only reads one input from stdin and assigns it to `times`, and assigns a constant value to `check`, the only changes to the initial state are the consumption of one test case from stdin and the assignment of values to `times` and `check`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
