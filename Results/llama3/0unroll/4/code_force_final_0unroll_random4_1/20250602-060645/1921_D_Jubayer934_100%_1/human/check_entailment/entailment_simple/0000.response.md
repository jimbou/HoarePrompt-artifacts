Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the elements of two arrays, a and b, such that the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements is maximized.

The program first reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers n and m, followed by n integers for array a and m integers for array b. It then sorts both arrays in ascending order.

The program then iterates over the sorted arrays, comparing the absolute differences between corresponding elements. If the absolute difference between an element in array a and the corresponding element in array b is greater than the absolute difference between the same element in array a and the corresponding element in the reversed array b, it updates the answer array with the latter difference. This is done to maximize the total difference D.

Finally, the program prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two sorted lists, a and b, for each test case.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference D by comparing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two sorted arrays and selecting the maximum difference. The use of the reversed array b to compare with array a ensures that the maximum difference is obtained. The program also correctly handles the case where the absolute difference between an element in array a and the corresponding element in array b is greater than the absolute difference between the same element in array a and the corresponding element in the reversed array b.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
