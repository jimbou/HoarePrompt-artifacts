Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference D between the two arrays. Here's why:

1. It first sorts both arrays in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum difference.
2. It then iterates through the first array `a` and for each element, it checks if the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the second array `b` is greater than the absolute difference with the element at the same index in `b`. If it is, it breaks the loop and starts appending the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b` in reverse order (i.e., `b[-(n-i)]`).
3. If the loop completes without finding a case where the absolute difference is greater, it simply appends the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` in the same order.
4. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences, which is the maximum total difference D.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the arrays are already sorted in ascending order.
* When the arrays are already sorted in descending order.
* When the arrays have duplicate elements.
* When the arrays have different lengths.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
