Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the array c_i of length n from the given array b_i of length m.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the lengths of the arrays, and the array elements.
2.  It sorts the arrays a and b correctly, which is necessary for finding the maximum total difference.
3.  The program iterates over the array a and calculates the absolute difference between each element of a and the corresponding element of b. If the difference between the current element of a and the last element of b (in reverse order) is greater than the difference between the current element of a and the current element of b, it updates the temporary variable temp and breaks the loop.
4.  If temp is not -1, the program appends the absolute differences between the remaining elements of a and the corresponding elements of b (in reverse order) to the list ans.
5.  Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the list ans, which represents the maximum total difference D.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the necessary steps to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
