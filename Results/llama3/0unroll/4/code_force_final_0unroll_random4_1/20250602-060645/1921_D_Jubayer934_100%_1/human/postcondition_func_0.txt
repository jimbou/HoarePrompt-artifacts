This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lists of integers. It calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two sorted lists, with the option to swap elements from the second list in reverse order if it results in a smaller difference. The function then prints the total sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case.
