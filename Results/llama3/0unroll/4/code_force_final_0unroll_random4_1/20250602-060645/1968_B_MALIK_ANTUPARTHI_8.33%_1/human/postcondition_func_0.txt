This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers and two binary strings. It then finds the maximum number of characters in the first binary string that can be matched with characters in the second binary string in order, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output based on the provided test cases.
