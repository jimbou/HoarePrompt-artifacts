The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively. Since `a` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `a` is now equal to t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^4), stdin contains a test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively.**
