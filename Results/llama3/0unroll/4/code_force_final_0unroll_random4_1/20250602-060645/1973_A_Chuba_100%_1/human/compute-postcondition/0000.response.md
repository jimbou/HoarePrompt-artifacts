The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers. The first integer of the first test case is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers, with the first integer of the first test case removed**
