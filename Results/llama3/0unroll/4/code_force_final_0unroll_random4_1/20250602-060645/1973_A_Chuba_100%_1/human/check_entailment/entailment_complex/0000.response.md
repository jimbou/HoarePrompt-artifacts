Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be non-decreasingly sorted.

The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program outputs -1, as it is impossible to achieve an odd sum with the scoring system described in the problem (2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, and 1 point for a draw). This is a correct check, as the sum of the scores must be even in order for the scores to be valid.

If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lowest scores from the total score, then dividing by 2. This calculation is correct, as it takes into account the fact that the highest score can be achieved by winning games against the other two players, and the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lowest scores represents the number of games that must have been won by the highest-scoring player. The maximum number of draws is then calculated by subtracting this number from the total score and dividing by 2.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
