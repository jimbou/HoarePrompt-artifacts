Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three players. The key insight is that the total number of points earned by the three players must be even, since each game awards either 2 points (for a win) or 1 point (for a draw). If the total number of points is odd, the program correctly outputs -1, indicating that the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

If the total number of points is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (i.e., the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lower scores) from the total number of points, and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw awards 1 point to each player, so the maximum number of draws is half the number of points that are not accounted for by wins.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided, and it is not possible to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
