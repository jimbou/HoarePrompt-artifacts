Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The scores are guaranteed to be non-negative and in non-decreasing order.

The provided program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players and checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened using the formula:

result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2

This formula works by first calculating the total number of points that could have been awarded in the games (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]). It then subtracts the maximum number of points that could have been awarded to the player with the highest score (v[2]) without exceeding the total number of points awarded to the other two players (v[0] + v[1]). This gives the maximum number of points that could have been awarded in draws. Finally, the program divides this number by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

The program then prints the calculated result.

Correctness: **True**
