Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program first checks if the total score is odd, in which case it outputs -1, as the scores cannot be achieved with any valid set of games. If the total score is even, it calculates the result by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest and the sum of the two lowest scores from the total score, then dividing by 2. This logic is based on the fact that in each game, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each. The program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

Correctness: **True**
