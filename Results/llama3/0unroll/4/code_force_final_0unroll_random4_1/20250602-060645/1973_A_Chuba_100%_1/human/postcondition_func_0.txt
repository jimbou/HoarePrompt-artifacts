This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates the result for each test case by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between the highest and the sum of the two lowest scores from the total score, then dividing by 2. If the total score is odd, it outputs -1. The function outputs a list of results, one for each test case, without modifying the input value `t`.
