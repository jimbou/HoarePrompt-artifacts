Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `r` to store the results.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes an empty set `cx` to store the values that `k` cannot be equal to, and two variables `ax` and `bx` to store the maximum and minimum possible values of `k`, respectively.

3. It then iterates over each constraint. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means that there are no possible values of `k` that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of possible values of `k` by subtracting `bx` from `ax`, adding 1, and then subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. This is because the values in `cx` are the ones that `k` cannot be equal to. It then appends this count to the result list `r`.

6. Finally, it prints the results in the list `r`, one per line.

Correctness: **True**
