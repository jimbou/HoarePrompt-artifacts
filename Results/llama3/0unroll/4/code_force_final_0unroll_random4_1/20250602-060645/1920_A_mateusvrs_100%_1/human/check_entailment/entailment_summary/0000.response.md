Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all three types of constraints and calculates the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes two variables `ax` and `bx` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values of `x` for constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.

3. It then iterates over each constraint. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means that there are no integers that satisfy all the constraints (because `bx` is the minimum value that `k` can be, and `ax` is the maximum value that `k` can be), so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints. It does this by subtracting `bx` from `ax` and adding 1 (to include both `bx` and `ax` in the count), and then subtracting the number of integers in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

6. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
