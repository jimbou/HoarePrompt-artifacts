Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.
2.  It initializes an empty set `cx` to store the values that `k` cannot be equal to (constraints of type 3), and two variables `ax` and `bx` to store the maximum and minimum possible values of `k` (constraints of type 1 and 2), respectively.
3.  It iterates over each constraint and updates `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly.
4.  After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`, which means there are no valid values for `k`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
5.  Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of values in the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done using the formula `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of values in `cx` that are within the range.
6.  Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newline characters.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

*   When there are no valid values for `k` (i.e., `bx` > `ax`).
*   When there are valid values for `k`, but some of them are excluded by constraints of type 3.
*   When there are no constraints of type 3.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
