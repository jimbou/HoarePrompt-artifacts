The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it becomes a positive integer between 1 and 500. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
