Based on the precondition, the list `r` contains `t` integers, each representing the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx` for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still a positive integer between 1 and 500.

The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the elements of the list `r` and the `sep='\n'` argument to separate each element with a newline character.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the `t` integers in the list `r`, each on a separate line, representing the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx` for each test case.

Output: **t integers, each representing the number of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set cx for each test case, separated by newline characters**
