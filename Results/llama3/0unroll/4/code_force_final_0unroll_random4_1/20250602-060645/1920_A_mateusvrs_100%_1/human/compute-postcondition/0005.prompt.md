You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 500) — the number of test cases.
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: Output State: The list r contains t integers, each representing the number of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set cx for each test case. The value of t remains unchanged, still a positive integer between 1 and 500.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: t integers, each representing the number of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set cx for each test case, separated by newline characters

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
