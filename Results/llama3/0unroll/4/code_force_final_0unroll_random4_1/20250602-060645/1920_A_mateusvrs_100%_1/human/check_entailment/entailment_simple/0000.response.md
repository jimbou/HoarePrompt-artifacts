Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes an empty set `cx` to store the values that `k` cannot be equal to, and two variables `ax` and `bx` to store the maximum and minimum possible values of `k`, respectively.
3. The program then iterates over each constraint and updates `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and the constraint value `x`. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and the constraint value `x`. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds the constraint value `x` to the set `cx`.
4. After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`, which means there are no possible values of `k` that satisfy all constraints. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of `k` by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of values in the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done by iterating over the values in `cx` and incrementing a counter `tmp` if the value is within the range. The result is then appended to the list `r`.
6. Finally, the program prints the results in the list `r`, separated by newline characters.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and constraints, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
