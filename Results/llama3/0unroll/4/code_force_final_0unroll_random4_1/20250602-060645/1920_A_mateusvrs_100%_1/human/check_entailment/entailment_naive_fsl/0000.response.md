Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum values of k (bx and ax) to the maximum and minimum possible values, respectively. Then, it iterates over each constraint and updates bx and ax accordingly. If a constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds x to the set cx.

After processing all constraints, the program checks if bx is greater than ax, which means there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, and appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range (ax - bx + 1).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where there are no possible values of k (bx > ax), and the case where there are possible values of k but some of them are excluded by type 3 constraints. The use of a set to store the excluded values ensures that each value is only counted once, even if it appears multiple times in the input.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
