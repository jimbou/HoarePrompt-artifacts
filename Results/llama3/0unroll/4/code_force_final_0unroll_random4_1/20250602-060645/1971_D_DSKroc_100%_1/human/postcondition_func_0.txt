This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of 0s and 1s. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make each string non-decreasing. If a string is already non-decreasing, it prints the length of the string. The function performs this calculation for each of the t input strings, printing the result for each.
