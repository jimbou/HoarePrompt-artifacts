The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input, `t` is now an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin is `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1.**
