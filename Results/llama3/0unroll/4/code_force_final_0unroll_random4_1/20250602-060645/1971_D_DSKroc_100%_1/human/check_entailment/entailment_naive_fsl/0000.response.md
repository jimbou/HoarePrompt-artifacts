Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string is "0001111". According to the problem description, the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string is 1, but the program outputs 2.

The issue with the program is that it increments the count whenever it encounters a pair of adjacent characters that are different. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that a single cut can be used to separate a group of zeros from a group of ones, even if there are multiple pairs of adjacent characters that are different.

For example, in the case of the input string "0001111", the program increments the count three times, once for each pair of adjacent characters that are different (0-1, 1-1, and 1-1). However, a single cut can be used to separate the group of zeros from the group of ones, resulting in a minimum of 1 piece needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
