Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if their sum is even. If the sum is odd, it prints -1, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum).
3. If the sum is even, it calculates the minimum of the sum of the first two integers `a + b` and half of the sum of all three integers `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is limited by the total number of points that can be distributed among the three players. The minimum of these two values represents the maximum possible number of draws.
4. The program prints the correct result for each test case, either -1 if the sum is odd or the minimum value calculated in step 3 if the sum is even.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
