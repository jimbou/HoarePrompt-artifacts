Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first checks if the sum of the three scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, because the total number of points awarded in any number of games must be even (each game awards 2 points in total). This is a correct check.

2.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. It does this by calculating the minimum of two values: `x` (half of the sum of all three scores) and `y` (the sum of the first two scores).

    *   `x` represents the maximum possible number of draws, because each draw awards 1 point to each player, and there are 2 points awarded in total in each game. Therefore, the maximum possible number of draws is half of the total number of points awarded.

    *   `y` represents the maximum possible number of points that could have been awarded to the first two players. Since the first two players can play each other, the number of draws between them cannot exceed the total number of points they have.

    *   The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is the maximum possible number of draws that could have occurred.

3.  The program handles all possible cases correctly. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum possible number of draws.

4.  The program assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description. This means that the input will always contain three space-separated integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`.

Correctness: **True**
