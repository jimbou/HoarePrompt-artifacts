Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and continues to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point each).

4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x` as the sum of the scores divided by 2, and `y` as the sum of the scores of the first two players.

5. The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is limited by the total number of points (`x`) and the number of points that the first two players have together (`y`).

However, there is a flaw in the program's logic. The program assumes that the maximum number of draws is always possible, which is not the case. For example, if the scores are (1, 1, 10), the program will print 2, but it is not possible to achieve these scores with 2 draws.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
