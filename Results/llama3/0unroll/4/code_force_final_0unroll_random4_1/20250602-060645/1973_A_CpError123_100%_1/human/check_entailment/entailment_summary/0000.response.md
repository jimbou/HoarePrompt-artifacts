Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the sum of the scores).
2.  The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by calculating the minimum of the sum of the first two scores (a + b) and half of the sum of all three scores ((a + b + c) // 2). This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the sum of the first two scores (a + b), as well as by the total number of games played ((a + b + c) // 2).

Correctness: **True**
