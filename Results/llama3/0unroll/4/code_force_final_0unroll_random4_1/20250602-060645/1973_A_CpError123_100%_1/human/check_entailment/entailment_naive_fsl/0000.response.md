Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is impossible to achieve the scores 1, 1, and 10 with any combination of games and results.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the total number of points is even and if the sum of the points of the first two players is less than or equal to the total number of points. However, it does not consider the case where the points of the third player are too high to be achieved with any combination of games and results.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the points of the third player are achievable with the remaining points after considering the points of the first two players. If the points of the third player are too high, the program should output -1.
