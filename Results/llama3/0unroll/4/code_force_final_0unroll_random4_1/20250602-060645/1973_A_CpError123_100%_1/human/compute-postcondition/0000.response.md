The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. Since the first input is an integer, `t` is assigned the value of this integer. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.**
