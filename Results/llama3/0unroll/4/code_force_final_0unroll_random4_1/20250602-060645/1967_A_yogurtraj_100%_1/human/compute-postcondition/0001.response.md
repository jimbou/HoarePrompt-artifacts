Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It sorts the integers, then calculates and prints the number of elements in the sorted array that are less than or equal to a given number, which is determined based on the input values of n, k, and the array. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results as a series of numbers.**
