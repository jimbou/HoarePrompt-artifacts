Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is n = 2, k = 4, and a = [8, 4]. The program outputs 15, but the correct output should be 16. The correct rearrangement is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], which contains 16 subarrays that are a permutation of [1, 2].
