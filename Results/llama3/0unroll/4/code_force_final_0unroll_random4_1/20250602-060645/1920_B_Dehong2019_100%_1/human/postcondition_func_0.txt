This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers (n, k, and x) and the second line contains n integers. It processes each test case by sorting the integers in descending order, calculating a maximum value (ans2) based on a series of operations involving the integers, k, and x, and prints the maximum value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, having consumed the corresponding number of lines from standard input.
