Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic for Alice's move. In the current implementation, Alice removes the largest elements first, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy. The correct approach would be to remove the elements that would result in the maximum reduction of the sum after Bob's move.

A counterexample is when the input is:

n = 4, k = 2, x = 2
a = [3, 3, 3, 3]

The program would output 0, but the correct output should be 6. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove two of the 3's, leaving two 3's for Bob to multiply by -1. The resulting sum would be 3 + 3 - 3 - 3 = 0, but since Alice removed two elements, the final sum would be 6.
