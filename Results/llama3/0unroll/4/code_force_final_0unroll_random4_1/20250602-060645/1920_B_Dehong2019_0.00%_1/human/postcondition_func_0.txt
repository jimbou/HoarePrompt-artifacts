This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers t, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of a modified sum of the integers, considering the values of k and x, and prints this maximum value. The function repeats this process for all test cases and does not retain any information from previous test cases.
