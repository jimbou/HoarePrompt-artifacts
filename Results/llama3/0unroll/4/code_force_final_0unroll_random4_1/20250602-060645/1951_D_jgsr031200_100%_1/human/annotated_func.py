    #State: Output State: n is 0, k is a positive integer less than the initial value of n, costs is a list containing two elements: 1 and 1, h is the sum of the integer division of the initial value of n by each element in costs.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')

    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer less than the initial value of n, costs is a list containing two elements: 1 and 1, h is the sum of the integer division of the initial value of n by each element in costs. If h < k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the elements of the list costs which are 1 and 1 are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to divide a given number `n` into `k` parts using two different costs (1 and 1) and prints the result. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of the integer division of `n` by each cost and checks if it is less than `k`. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the costs (1 and 1). The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly.
