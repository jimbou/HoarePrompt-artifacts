Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is equal to `k` and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program prints "YES" and then prints 1 and 1, which is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n` is 2 and `k` is 2, the program prints "YES" and then prints 1 and 1, but this means that Alice will buy 2 jewels at the first stall and then she will not have enough money to buy any jewels at the second stall, so she will not buy exactly 2 jewels.

The program should handle this case differently, for example, by printing "YES" and then printing 1 and 2, which would mean that Alice buys 1 jewel at the first stall and then 1 jewel at the second stall, for a total of 2 jewels.
