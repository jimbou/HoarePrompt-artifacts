Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where n is equal to k, n is less than k, and n is greater than or equal to k. In the case where n is greater than or equal to k, it correctly calculates the number of jewels that can be bought at each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is less than k. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number of stalls (which is 2), and the prices of the jewels at each stall.

Correctness: **True**
