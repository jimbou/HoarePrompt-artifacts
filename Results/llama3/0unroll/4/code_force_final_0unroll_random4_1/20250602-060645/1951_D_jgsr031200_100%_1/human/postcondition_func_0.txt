This function determines whether it is possible to divide a given number `n` into `k` parts using two different costs (1 and 1) and prints the result. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of the integer division of `n` by each cost and checks if it is less than `k`. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the costs (1 and 1). The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly.
