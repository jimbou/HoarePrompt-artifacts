Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If it is, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice, indicating that Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1 and Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

If n is less than k, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the sum of the integer division of n by each of the two costs (1 and 1). It then checks if this sum is less than k. If it is, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

However, if the sum is greater than or equal to k, the program prints 'YES', 2, and the costs (1 and 1). This indicates that Bob can set up two stalls with prices of 1 and 1, and Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

The issue with this program is that it only considers two costs (1 and 1) and does not explore other possible combinations of costs that could result in Alice buying exactly k jewels. Therefore, the program may incorrectly print 'NO' in cases where it is actually possible for Bob to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Correctness: **False**
