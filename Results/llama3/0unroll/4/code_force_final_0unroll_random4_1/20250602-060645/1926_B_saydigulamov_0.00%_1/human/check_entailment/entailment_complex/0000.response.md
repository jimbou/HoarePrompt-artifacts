Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks if the first two rows containing '1's have the same count of '1's, and if so, it prints a list of these counts. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

A square is defined as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1', which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The program does not check if the '1's in each row are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

A triangle is defined as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i-1 consecutive characters '1', and the central '1's are located in one column. The program does not check if the number of '1's in each row follows this pattern.

Therefore, the program may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
