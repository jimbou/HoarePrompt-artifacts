Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a lines each containing a characters '0' or '1', where a is the number of lines and characters in each line. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is now known to be an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), which is the number of lines and characters in each line of the grid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been partially read to determine the value of `a`. The rest of the test case, which consists of `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', is still in the stdin. The properties of the grid, such as containing exactly one triangle or square with all '1's and the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1, are still valid.
