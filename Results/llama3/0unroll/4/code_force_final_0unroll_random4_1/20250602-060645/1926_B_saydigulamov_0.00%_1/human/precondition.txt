stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing a string of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
