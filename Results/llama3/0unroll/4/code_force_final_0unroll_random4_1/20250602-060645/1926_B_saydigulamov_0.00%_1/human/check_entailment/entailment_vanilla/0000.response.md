Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by reading the input grid and counting the number of '1's in each row. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
2. The program does not check if the '1's in each row are consecutive or if they are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
3. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle with the apex at the bottom.
4. The program does not print the correct output. It prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check the following conditions:

* If the shape is a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
* If the shape is a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase by 2 for each row, and the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program should also handle the case where the shape is a triangle with the apex at the bottom.

Correctness: **False**
