Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case represents a grid containing a triangle or square of '1's. It processes each grid, and if the first two rows containing '1's have the same count of '1's, it prints a list of these counts. The function does not modify the input data and does not return any value, only printing the results for specific cases.**
