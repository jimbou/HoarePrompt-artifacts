Reasoning: 

The given program is not correct. The program is supposed to determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle and print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly. However, the program only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's is equal, and if so, it prints the counts. This is not a correct way to determine the shape of the grid.

The program does not check the counts of '1's in the subsequent rows, nor does it check the positions of the '1's in the grid. It also does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle but not a square.

Moreover, the program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement. Instead, it prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
