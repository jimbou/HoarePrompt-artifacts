Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of '1's in a row of the grid, but only for the rows that contain a square or triangle with all '1's. The list only includes the counts for the first two rows that contain '1's. If no such shape is found, the output is empty. The value of 'a' remains unchanged, still representing the number of lines in the grid.**
