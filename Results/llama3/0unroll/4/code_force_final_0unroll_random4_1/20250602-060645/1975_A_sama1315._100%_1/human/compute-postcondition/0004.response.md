Functionality: **This function reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input data to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set of input data consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The function then applies the func_1 function to each set of input data and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line, with a total of t results.**
