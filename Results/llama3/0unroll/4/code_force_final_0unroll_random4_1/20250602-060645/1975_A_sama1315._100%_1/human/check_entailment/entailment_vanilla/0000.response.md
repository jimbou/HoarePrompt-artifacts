Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function 1, `func_1(a)`, takes an array `a` as input and checks if it can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. It calculates the length of the array `n` and creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
2. It concatenates the original array `a` with itself to create a new array `concatenated_a`. This is done to simulate the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
3. It then checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` with the same length as `sorted_a` is equal to `sorted_a`. If such a subarray is found, it means that the original array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation, and the function returns 'Yes'.
4. If no such subarray is found after checking all possible subarrays, the function returns 'No'.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case. It then prints the results.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program is correct. It correctly implements the required operation and checks if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

Correctness: **True**
