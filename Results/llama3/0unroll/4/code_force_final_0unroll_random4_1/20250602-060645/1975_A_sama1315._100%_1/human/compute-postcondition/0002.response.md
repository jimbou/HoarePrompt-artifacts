Based on the initial state, the `print` statement will print the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line.

The `results` list contains `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a)` for each set of input data. Since the exact implementation of `func_1(a)` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in the `results` list.

However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[result of func_1(a) for each set of input data], where each result is on a new line, and there are t results in total**
