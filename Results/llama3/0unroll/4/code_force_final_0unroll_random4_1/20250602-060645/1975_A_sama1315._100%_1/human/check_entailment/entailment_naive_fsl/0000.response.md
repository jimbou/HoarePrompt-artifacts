Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. It does this by concatenating the array with itself and checking if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array. If it is, then the array can be made non-decreasing, and the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

The function `func_2` reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles arrays of different lengths and elements, and it correctly determines whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the program is correct.
