Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes an array 'a' as input and checks if a sublist of the concatenated version of 'a' is equal to the sorted version of 'a'. If such a sublist exists, it returns 'Yes', otherwise, it returns 'No'. This function effectively checks if the array can be sorted by swapping two parts.

func_2 reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input data to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set of input data consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The function then applies func_1 to each set of input data and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line, with a total of t results.

The program is correct because func_1 accurately checks if the array can be sorted by swapping two parts, and func_2 correctly reads and processes the input data, applying func_1 to each set of input data and printing the results.

Correctness: **True**
