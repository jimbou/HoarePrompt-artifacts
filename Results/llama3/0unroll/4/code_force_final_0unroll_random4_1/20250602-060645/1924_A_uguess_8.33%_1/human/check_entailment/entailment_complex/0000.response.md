Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and m, and the second line contains a string s of length m.

2. The program initializes a counter `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count the number of substrings of length k that contain all k distinct characters.

3. The program then iterates over the string s. For each character `ss` in s, it calculates the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a' to get a value between 0 and k-1. This value is used to set the corresponding bit in the `cur` variable.

4. If the `cur` variable has all bits set (i.e., it equals `(1 << k) - 1`), it means that all k distinct characters have been found in the current substring. In this case, the `cnt` counter is incremented and the `cur` variable is reset to 0.

5. After iterating over the entire string s, the program checks if the `cnt` counter is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.

6. If the `cnt` counter is less than n, the program prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that contains all k distinct characters. The constructed string is printed.

7. The program repeats this process for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its execution states match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
