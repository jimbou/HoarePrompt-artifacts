Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and m, and the second line contains a string s of length m. It then processes the string s to count the number of substrings of length k that contain all k distinct characters. If the count is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that contains all k distinct characters, printing the constructed string. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
