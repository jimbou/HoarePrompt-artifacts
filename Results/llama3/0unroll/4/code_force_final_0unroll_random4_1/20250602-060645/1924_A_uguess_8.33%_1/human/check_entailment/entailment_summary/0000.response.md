Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. 

The program uses a bit manipulation technique to keep track of the characters that have been seen so far in the string s. It uses a variable cur to store the bits corresponding to the characters that have been seen. If a character has been seen, the corresponding bit in cur is set to 1. 

The program then checks if all k bits in cur are set to 1, which means all k distinct characters have been seen. If this happens, it increments the count of substrings that contain all k distinct characters. 

If the count is greater than or equal to n, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that contains all k distinct characters. The constructed string is printed as the answer.

Correctness: **True**
