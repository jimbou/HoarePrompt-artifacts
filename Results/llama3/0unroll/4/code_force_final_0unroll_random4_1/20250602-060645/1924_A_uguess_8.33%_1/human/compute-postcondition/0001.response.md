Output State: **The loop will execute t times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read two lines of input, the first line containing two integers k and m, and the second line containing a string s of length m. The loop will then process the string s and calculate the number of substrings of length k that contain all k distinct characters. If the number of such substrings is greater than or equal to n, it will print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO' and construct a string of length n that contains all k distinct characters and print it. After processing all t test cases, the loop will terminate.**
