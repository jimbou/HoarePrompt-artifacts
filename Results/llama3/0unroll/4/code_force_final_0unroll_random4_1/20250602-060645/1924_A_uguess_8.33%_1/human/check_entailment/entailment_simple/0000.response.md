Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
2.  It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of substrings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of `s`.
3.  It uses a bitmask `cur` to keep track of the characters in `s` that have been seen so far. The bitmask is initialized to 0, and for each character `ss` in `s`, it checks if the corresponding bit in `cur` is set. If not, it sets the bit and increments `cnt` if all `k` bits are set.
4.  After processing the entire string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
5.  If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` of length `n` that contains all `k` distinct characters. It does this by appending the character corresponding to the unset bit in `cur` to `ans`, followed by `cnt` repetitions of the last character of `s`, and finally `n - cnt - 1` repetitions of 'a'.
6.  The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, in which case it simply prints 'YES' if `k` is 1 and 'NO' otherwise.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
