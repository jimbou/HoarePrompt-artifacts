Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and counting the number of consecutive equal elements. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive equal elements seen so far. If all elements in the array are equal, it outputs -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count of consecutive equal elements.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. It correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are equal and outputs -1 in such cases.

Correctness: **True**
