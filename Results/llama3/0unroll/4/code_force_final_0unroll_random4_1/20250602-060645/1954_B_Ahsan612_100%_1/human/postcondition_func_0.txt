This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in each list. If all elements in a list are equal, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of consecutive equal elements. The function processes each test case independently and prints the results in the order they were received.
