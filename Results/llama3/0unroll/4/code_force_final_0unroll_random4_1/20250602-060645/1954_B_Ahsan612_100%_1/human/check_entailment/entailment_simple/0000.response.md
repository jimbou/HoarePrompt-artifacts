Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in a beautiful array. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes `same` to 1, which represents the count of consecutive equal elements. It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array, which is the current number being considered.

2. The program then iterates through the array, incrementing `same` whenever it encounters the same number as `num`. When it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` (the minimum count of consecutive equal elements) and resets `same` to 1.

3. After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.

4. Finally, the program checks if `minn` is equal to infinity (which means no sequences of consecutive equal elements were found) or equal to the length of the array (which means all elements are equal). If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where all elements are equal or where no sequences of consecutive equal elements exist.

Correctness: **True**
