Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will return the minimum length of the sequences of the same element, but it will not consider the fact that removing one element from the sequence can make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], the program will return 2, but the correct answer is 1, because removing one element from the sequence can make the array not beautiful.

The program should be modified to consider this case and return the correct answer.
