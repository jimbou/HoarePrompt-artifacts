Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the same element. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
3. It initializes variables to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the same element (`same`) and the minimum count (`minn`).
4. It iterates through the array, incrementing the `same` count when it encounters the same element and resetting the count when it encounters a different element.
5. When it encounters a different element, it updates the `minn` variable with the minimum of the current `minn` value and the `same` count.
6. After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the `minn` value is equal to infinity or the length of the array. If so, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.
7. Otherwise, it prints the `minn` value, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
