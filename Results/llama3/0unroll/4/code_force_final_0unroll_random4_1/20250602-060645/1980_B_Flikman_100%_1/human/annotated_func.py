#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' printed to the console, one for each test case. The output will depend on the values of n, f, k, and the list a in each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results to the console. For each test case, it takes three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers, identifies a 'favorite value' from the list based on the index f, sorts the list in descending order, and counts the occurrences of the favorite value. It then determines the number of favorite values removed from the top k elements of the sorted list. Based on this count, it prints 'YES' if all favorite values are removed, 'NO' if none are removed, or 'MAYBE' if some but not all favorite values are removed. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the corresponding result.
