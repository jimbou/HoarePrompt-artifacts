Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube has a value that is not unique among the cubes. In this case, the program only checks if the favorite cube is removed in the first k positions, but it does not consider the fact that the favorite cube could be in a different position after sorting.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print "MAYBE", but the correct answer is "YES" because the favorite cube will always be removed in this case.

The program should be modified to consider the position of the favorite cube after sorting, not just its value.
