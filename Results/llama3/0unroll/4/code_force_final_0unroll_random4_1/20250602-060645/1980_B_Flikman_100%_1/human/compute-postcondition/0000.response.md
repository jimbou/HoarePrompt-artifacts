Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 1000, which was read from the input. The rest of the input remains the same, with `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the second line with `n` integers `a_i`.
