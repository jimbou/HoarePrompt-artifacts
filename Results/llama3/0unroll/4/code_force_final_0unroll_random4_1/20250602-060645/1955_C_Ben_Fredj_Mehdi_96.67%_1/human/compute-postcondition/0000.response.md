Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the same test cases, but the first input (the value of `t`) has been read and assigned to the variable `t`. The rest of the test cases remain in the stdin, waiting to be processed.
