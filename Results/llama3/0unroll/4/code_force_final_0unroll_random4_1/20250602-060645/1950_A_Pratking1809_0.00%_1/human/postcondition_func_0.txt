This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads three digits a, b, and c. Based on the values of a, b, and c, it prints one of the strings 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' to the standard output, indicating whether the digits form a stair, peak, or none of these patterns, respectively. The function does not modify the input values or return any values, only producing output based on the input patterns.
