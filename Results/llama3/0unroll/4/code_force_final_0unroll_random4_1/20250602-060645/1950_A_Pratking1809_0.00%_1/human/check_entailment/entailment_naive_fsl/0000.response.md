Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input is 3 2 1. According to the problem description, this should output "NONE" because it does not satisfy either the stair or peak conditions. However, the program outputs "NONE" twice, once for the stair condition and once for the peak condition, because the "if" statements are not exclusive. 

To fix this, the program should use "elif" statements instead of "if" statements to ensure that only one condition is checked at a time. Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
