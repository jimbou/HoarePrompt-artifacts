Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 5 3, the program should print "Yes" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and then remove 2 cubes to get a tower with 3 cubes. However, the program prints "No" because it only checks if the number of moves is equal to the number of cubes, or if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, or if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity. It does not consider the case where the number of moves is greater than the number of cubes and the difference between them is even.

The correct solution should check if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, regardless of whether the number of moves is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of cubes.
