Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a series of moves. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. If the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, it prints 'YES'.
2. If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'.
3. If the number of moves is greater than the desired number of cubes, it checks the parity of the test case number and the number of moves. If they have the same parity, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, it's possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube at a time.
* If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's not possible to build the tower because there aren't enough moves to add the required number of cubes.
* If the number of moves is greater than the desired number of cubes, the parity of the number of moves and the test case number determines whether it's possible to build the tower. If they have the same parity, it's possible to build the tower by adding and removing cubes in an alternating pattern. If they have different parity, it's not possible to build the tower because the number of moves would always be one more or one less than the desired number of cubes.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
