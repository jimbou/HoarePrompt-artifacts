Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and m.

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If n is equal to m, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put n cubes on top of the tower.
2. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If n is greater than m, it checks if the parity of n is the same as the parity of m. If they are the same, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with m cubes by putting n-m cubes on top and then removing (n-m)/2 cubes from the top. If the parity is different, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with m cubes.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. The use of the modulo operator (%) to check the parity of n and m is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
