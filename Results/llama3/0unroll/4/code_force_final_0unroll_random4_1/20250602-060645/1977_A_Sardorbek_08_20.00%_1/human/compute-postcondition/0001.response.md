Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed to the console, depending on the values of b and c read from stdin, and the value of a. The number of lines printed is equal to the value of a. The values of a, b, and c are not changed. The stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
