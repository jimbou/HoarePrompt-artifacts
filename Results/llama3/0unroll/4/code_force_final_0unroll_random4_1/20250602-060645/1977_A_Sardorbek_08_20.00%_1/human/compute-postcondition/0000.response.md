Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m, because one line has been read and processed. The values of the other variables are not affected.
