This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters in each string and prints the count for each test case. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each string and printing the '@' character count, before resetting the count for the next test case.
