Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'. a is an integer equal to the original value of t, s is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000. The second line assigns the value 0 to `s`. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` is reduced by 1 since one integer has been read from stdin.
