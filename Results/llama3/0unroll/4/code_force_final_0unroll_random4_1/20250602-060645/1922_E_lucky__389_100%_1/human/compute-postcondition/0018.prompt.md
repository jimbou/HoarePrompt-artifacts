You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t space-separated integers (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The variables x, subseq_lens, and mx retain their initial values: x is an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, and mx is 0. The input from stdin is not processed, and the numbers 1 and 0 are not used in any calculations.
    #State: x is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t space-separated integers (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the list subseq_lens)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a string of space-separated integers, where the first `mx-1` integers are from 0 to `mx-1`, followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print()
    #This is printed: A string of space-separated integers, where the first mx-1 integers are from 0 to mx-1, followed by all elements in subseq_lens except the first one.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The variables x, subseq_lens, and mx retain their initial values: x is an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, and mx is 0. The input from stdin is not processed, and the numbers 1 and 0 are not used in any calculations.

Case_2: Output State: The output state is a string of space-separated integers, where the first `mx-1` integers are from 0 to `mx-1`, followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
