Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 3. The program outputs [0, 1, 0] which has 4 increasing subsequences ([], [0], [1], [0, 1]), not 3. 

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the array. It simply appends the subsequence lengths to the array, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have the correct number of increasing subsequences. 

For example, when X is 3, the program calculates the subsequence lengths as [1] and [1], and then appends them to the array as [0, 1, 0]. However, this array has 4 increasing subsequences, not 3. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly construct the array based on the subsequence lengths. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to construct the array, ensuring that each subsequence is added in a way that minimizes the number of increasing subsequences. 

However, without a correct implementation, the program is incorrect for certain inputs, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
