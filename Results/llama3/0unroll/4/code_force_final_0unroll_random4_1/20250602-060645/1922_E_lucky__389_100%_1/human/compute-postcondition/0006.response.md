Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The variables x, subseq_lens, and mx retain their initial values: x is an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, and mx is 0. The input from stdin is not processed, and the numbers 1 and 0 are not used in any calculations.**
