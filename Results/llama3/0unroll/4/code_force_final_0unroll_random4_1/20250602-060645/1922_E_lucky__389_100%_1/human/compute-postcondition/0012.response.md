The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.

Based on the precondition, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one.

Since `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, the length of the list `ansv` will be equal to the number of integers from 0 to `mx-1` plus the number of elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one.

The number of integers from 0 to `mx-1` is `mx`, and the number of elements in `subseq_lens` except the first one is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

Therefore, the length of the list `ansv` is `mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

Output: **mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the list subseq_lens)**
