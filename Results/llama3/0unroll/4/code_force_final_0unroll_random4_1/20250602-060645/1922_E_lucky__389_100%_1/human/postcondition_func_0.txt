This function reads an integer t and t space-separated integers from standard input, then generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of the input integers. If t is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without processing the input. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of the input integers, generates a sequence of integers from 0 to this maximum length minus 1, and appends the lengths of the binary representations of the input integers (excluding the first one). The function then prints the length of this sequence and the sequence itself, separated by spaces.
