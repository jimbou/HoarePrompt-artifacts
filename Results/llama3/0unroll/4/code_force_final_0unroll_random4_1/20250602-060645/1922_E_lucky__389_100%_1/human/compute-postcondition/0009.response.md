Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`**.

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged at 0. The list `subseq_lens` and its maximum value `mx` also remain unchanged. A new list `ansv` is created, which contains integers from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
