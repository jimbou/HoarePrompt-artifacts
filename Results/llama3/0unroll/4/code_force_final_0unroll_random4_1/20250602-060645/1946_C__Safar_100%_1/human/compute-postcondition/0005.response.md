Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where each key is a node in a tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, stack is an empty list, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree, d is a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node, r is the number of nodes in the tree with a subtree size greater than or equal to A. Additionally, the number of nodes with a subtree size greater than or equal to A is less than or equal to k, and if the size of the subtree rooted at node 1 is greater than or equal to A, then the number of nodes with a subtree size greater than or equal to A is strictly less than k.***
