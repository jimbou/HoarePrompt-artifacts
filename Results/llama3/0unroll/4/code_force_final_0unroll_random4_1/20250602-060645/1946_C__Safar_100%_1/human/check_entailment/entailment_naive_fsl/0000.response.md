Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It first constructs the graph from the given edges and then uses a depth-first search (DFS) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges to get components of size at least x.

The DFS function correctly handles the visited nodes and the parent-child relationships, and it correctly updates the count of components of size at least x.

The binary search function correctly updates the search range based on the result of the DFS function, and it correctly prints the maximum value of x that satisfies the condition.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
