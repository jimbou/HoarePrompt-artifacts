Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Function 1 (`func_1`) initializes the graph `g` and calls the binary search function `check` to find the maximum value of x. The binary search function iterates from 1 to `n // k` (where `n` is the number of vertices and `k` is the number of edges to be removed) and checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `mid` vertices.

Function 2 (`check`) performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to count the number of connected components with at least `A` vertices. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit and a dictionary `d` to store the size of each connected component. If the number of connected components with at least `A` vertices is greater than `k` or if the size of the root component is at least `A` and the number of connected components is equal to `k`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the maximum value of x and uses DFS to count the number of connected components with at least `A` vertices.

Correctness: **True**
