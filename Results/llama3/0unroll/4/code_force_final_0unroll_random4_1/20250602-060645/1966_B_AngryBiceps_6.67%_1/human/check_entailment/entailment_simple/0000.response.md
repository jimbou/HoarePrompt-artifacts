Reasoning: 

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking if the first row, last row, first column, and last column of the grid have the same color. If they do, then it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.

However, the program is not correctly implementing this logic. It is only checking if the first row and last row have the same color, and if the first column and last column have the same color. It is not checking if the first row and last column have the same color, or if the first column and last row have the same color.

Therefore, the program is not correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
