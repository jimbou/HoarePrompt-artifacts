Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. It only checks if the first row and last row are the same color, but it does not consider the case where the first row and last row are different colors but the grid can still be made the same color by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

For example, if the input is:

3 3
WBW
BBB
WBW

The program will print "NO" because the first row and last row are different colors. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the two black squares in the middle row and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them black.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
