Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row and the last row of the grid are the same color, and if the first column and the last column are the same color. If either of these conditions is not met, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations to be performed, not just one. Therefore, it is possible for the grid to be made into a single color even if the first row and the last row are not the same color, or if the first column and the last column are not the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWWW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW

The first row and the last row are not the same color, and the first column and the last column are not the same color. However, it is still possible to make the entire grid into a single color by performing a series of operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
