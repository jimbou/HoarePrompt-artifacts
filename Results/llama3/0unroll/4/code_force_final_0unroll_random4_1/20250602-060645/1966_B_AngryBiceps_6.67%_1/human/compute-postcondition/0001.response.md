Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs a result for each case. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of a matrix of characters 'W' and 'B', and determines whether the matrix is "good" or not based on specific conditions. The function returns a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, one for each test case, indicating whether the corresponding matrix is good or not.**
