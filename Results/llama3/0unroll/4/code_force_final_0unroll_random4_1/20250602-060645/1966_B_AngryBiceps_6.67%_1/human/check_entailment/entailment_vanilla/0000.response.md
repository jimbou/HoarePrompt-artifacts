Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row and last row of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it checks if the first column and last column are the same color. If neither of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just two. Therefore, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color even if the first row and last row are not the same color, or if the first column and last column are not the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWWW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW

The first row and last row are not the same color, and the first column and last column are not the same color. However, it is still possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
