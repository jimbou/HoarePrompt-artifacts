#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_1()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_1() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were originally returned by func_1() as a string of space-separated integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. It takes a string of space-separated integers returned by func_1(), splits it into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list. The function does not modify the original string or any external state, and its sole purpose is to transform the input string into a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If the current value of ans includes 0, then the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function does nothing.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the number of unique values that x can take after m iterations of the loop (which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a subset of integers from 1 to n (where n is the given positive integer)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of unique values that a variable x can take after a specified number of iterations, based on a set of rules defined by the input parameters n, m, and x. It also prints the subset of integers from 1 to n that x can take. The function takes into account the possibility of x wrapping around from 0 to n, and ensures that the output values are within the range 1 to n.
