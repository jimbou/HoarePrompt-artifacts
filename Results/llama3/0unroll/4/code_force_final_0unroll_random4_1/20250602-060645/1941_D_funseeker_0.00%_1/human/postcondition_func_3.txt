This function calculates and prints the number of unique values that a variable x can take after a specified number of iterations, based on a set of rules defined by the input parameters n, m, and x. It also prints the subset of integers from 1 to n that x can take. The function takes into account the possibility of x wrapping around from 0 to n, and ensures that the output values are within the range 1 to n.
