Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If the current value of ans includes 0, then the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function does nothing.***
