The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the possible values of `x` after `m` iterations of the loop.

Since `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `x`, and `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, the output will be a collection of unique integers between 1 and n (inclusive).

The exact values in the output depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the initial value of `x`. However, based on the precondition, we can conclude that the output will be a subset of the integers from 1 to n.

Output: **a subset of integers from 1 to n (where n is the given positive integer)**
