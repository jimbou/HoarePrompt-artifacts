Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads the input, processes it, and prints the output as required.

The program uses a set `ans` to keep track of all possible values of `x` after each iteration of the loop. It correctly handles the cases where the direction of the throw is '0', '1', or '?'. If the direction is '?', it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.

The program also correctly handles the case where the result of the modulo operation is 0, which would otherwise be discarded. Instead, it replaces 0 with `n`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

The program prints the number of unique values that `x` can take after `m` iterations of the loop, followed by the values themselves. This is in accordance with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
