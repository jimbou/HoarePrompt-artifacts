Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing the value of x**.

The first line assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to `n`, `m`, and `x`. The second line creates a set `ans` containing the value of `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`, but their types and constraints remain the same. The set `ans` is created with a single element, which is the value of `x`.
