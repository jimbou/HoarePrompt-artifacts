This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, and a list of n integers. It then processes each test case by iterating over q queries, each containing two integers l and r. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] with a XOR prefix sum equal to 0. The function returns a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per test case, indicating whether such a subarray exists.
