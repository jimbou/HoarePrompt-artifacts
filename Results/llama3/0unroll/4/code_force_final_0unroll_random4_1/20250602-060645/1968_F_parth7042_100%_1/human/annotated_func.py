#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers. For each test case, there are q queries, each query containing two integers l and r.
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2

            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the results list contains the answers to all the test cases. The stdin has been fully processed, and the index is at the end of the input data. The variables t, n, q, a, pf, and mp are no longer in use, and their values are no longer relevant. The results list contains a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each representing the answer to a test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per line, representing the answers to all the test cases

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, and a list of n integers. It then processes each test case by iterating over q queries, each containing two integers l and r. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] with a XOR prefix sum equal to 0. The function returns a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per test case, indicating whether such a subarray exists.
