Based on the precondition, the `results` list contains a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each representing the answer to a test case. The `print` statement is using the `join` method to concatenate these strings with a newline character (`\n`) in between each string.

Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the answers to all the test cases, one per line, with each answer being either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output: **A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per line, representing the answers to all the test cases**
