Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers. t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list.**

The code reads the first input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, storing it in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. The `index` variable is incremented by 1, so it now points to the second element in `data`. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
