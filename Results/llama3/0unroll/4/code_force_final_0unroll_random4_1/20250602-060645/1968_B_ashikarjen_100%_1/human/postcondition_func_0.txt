This function reads two binary strings 'a' and 'b' from standard input, along with their lengths 'n' and 'm', and prints the length of the longest common substring between 'a' and 'b'. The function does not return any value but updates variables 'k' and 'j' to store the length of the longest common substring and the index of the character in 'b' that is one position after the last character of the longest common substring, respectively. The original input values 't', 'n', 'm', 'a', and 'b' remain unchanged.
