Output State: **The program returns nothing, but the length of the longest common substring of strings 'a' and 'b' is printed, and variables 'k' and 'j' are updated accordingly. The value of 'k' is the length of the longest common substring, and the value of 'j' is the index of the character in 'b' that is one position after the last character of the longest common substring. Variables 't', 'n', 'm', 'a', and 'b' remain unchanged.**
