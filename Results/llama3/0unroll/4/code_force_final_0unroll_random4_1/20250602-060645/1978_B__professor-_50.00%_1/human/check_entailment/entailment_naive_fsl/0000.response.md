Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `b - a` is odd. In this case, the expression `(b - a) / 2` will truncate the result to an integer, losing the fractional part. This will lead to an incorrect calculation of the profit.

For example, if `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`, the program will calculate the profit as `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) = int((6 / 2) * 7 + 5 * 5) = int(3 * 7 + 25) = int(21 + 25) = 46`, which is incorrect. The correct profit should be `45`.

To fix this issue, the program should use integer arithmetic to calculate the profit, avoiding the truncation of the fractional part.
