Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case still contains three integers n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.
