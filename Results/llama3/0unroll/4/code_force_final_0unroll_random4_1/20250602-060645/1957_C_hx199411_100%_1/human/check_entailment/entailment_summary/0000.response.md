Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid fillings for the remaining cells, taking into account the predefined cell positions and the rules of the game. The program also handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining and prints 1 in this case.

Correctness: **True**
