Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It takes into account the number of moves already played and the size of the chessboard, and uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of remaining moves is 0 or 1, and for larger numbers of remaining moves, it uses the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) to calculate the number of possible configurations. This recurrence relation is based on the fact that for each remaining move, there are two possibilities: either the move is mirrored by the computer, or it is not.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of remaining moves is even or odd, and it takes into account the fact that the computer may not be able to mirror a move if the move is on the diagonal.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
