Output State: **The output state is the number of ways to fill the remaining m cells in the grid with 1s and 0s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value.**

The output state is the result of the dynamic programming algorithm that calculates the number of ways to fill the remaining m cells in the grid with 1s and 0s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value. The algorithm uses a bottom-up approach, starting from the base cases where m is 1 or 2, and then builds up the solution for larger values of m.

The output state is the value of dp[m], which represents the number of ways to fill the remaining m cells in the grid with 1s and 0s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value. This value is calculated using the recurrence relation:

dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

where dp[i - 1] is the number of ways to fill the remaining i - 1 cells, and dp[i - 2] is the number of ways to fill the remaining i - 2 cells.

The output state is the result of the loop executing all the iterations, and it represents the number of ways to fill the remaining m cells in the grid with 1s and 0s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value.
