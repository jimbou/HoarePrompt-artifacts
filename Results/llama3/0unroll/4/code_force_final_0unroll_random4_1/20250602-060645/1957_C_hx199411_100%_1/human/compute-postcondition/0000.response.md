The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines each containing two integers r_i and c_i. Since the first input is accepted and assigned to t, the stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines each containing two integers r_i and c_i. The value of t is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines each containing two integers r_i and c_i.**
