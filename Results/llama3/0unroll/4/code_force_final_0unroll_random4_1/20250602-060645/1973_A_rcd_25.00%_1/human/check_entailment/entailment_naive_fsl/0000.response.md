Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to obtain a score of 10 with the given rules, as the maximum score a player can get in a game is 2.

In the program, the condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to determine if the scores are valid. The program should also check if the scores can be obtained by a combination of wins, losses, and draws. The current implementation does not consider this and can produce incorrect results.

For instance, in the case of 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but it is not possible to obtain a score of 10 with the given rules. The program should output -1 in this case, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.
