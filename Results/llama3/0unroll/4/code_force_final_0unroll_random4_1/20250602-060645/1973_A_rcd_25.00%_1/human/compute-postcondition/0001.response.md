Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the maximum number of points that can be scored by the three players in each test case, or -1 if it is not possible to score an even number of points. The list will have a length of t, where t is the number of test cases. The value of t will remain unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.**
