Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining test cases still contain three integers each, representing the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
