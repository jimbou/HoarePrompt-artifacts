Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where the sum of the scores is odd, in which case it prints -1. It also correctly handles the cases where the maximum score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, in which case it prints the sum of the other two scores.

In the case where the maximum score is less than the sum of the other two scores, the program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of draws. It starts with the minimum possible number of draws (which is the minimum of the differences between the maximum score and the other two scores) and increments it until it finds a number of draws that satisfies the condition that the minimum score minus the number of draws is less than or equal to the middle score minus the maximum score plus the number of draws.

If such a number of draws is found, the program prints the minimum score minus the number of draws plus the maximum score. If no such number of draws is found, the program prints the maximum score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
