Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of points that can be scored by the players in each test case, or -1 if it's not possible to score an even number of points. The function processes all test cases and outputs a list of integers, each representing the maximum score for the corresponding test case.**
