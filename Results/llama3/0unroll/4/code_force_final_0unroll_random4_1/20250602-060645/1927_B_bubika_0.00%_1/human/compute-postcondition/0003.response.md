Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then maps each integer to a corresponding character in the alphabet (a-z), increments the count of the mapped character, and prints the resulting string. The function repeats this process for all test cases, ultimately consuming all input from standard input and producing a series of strings as output.**
