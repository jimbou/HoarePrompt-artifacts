Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each matrix from the input.
2. The program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using a correct formula. The formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that maximizes their contribution to the sum.
3. The program prints the correct output format, which includes the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is 2n in this case).
4. The program generates the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum. It does this by printing a series of lines, each containing a specific pattern of integers that represent the operations to be performed on the matrix.

The key insight here is that the program uses a clever formula to calculate the maximum sum, and then generates the operations to achieve that sum in a way that is consistent with the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
