Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
2. The program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using a nested loop. The formula used is correct, as it calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n` squared, which is the maximum possible sum for an `n x n` matrix.
3. The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2n`) for each test case.
4. The program then prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum. For each row and column, it prints a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, which is a valid operation according to the problem statement.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
