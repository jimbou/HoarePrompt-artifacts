Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the size of a sequence. For each sequence, it calculates a sum using a nested loop, prints the sum and twice the sequence size, and then prints a series of lines, each containing a specific pattern of integers. The function consumes the input stream and produces output based on the calculated sums and sequence sizes.**
