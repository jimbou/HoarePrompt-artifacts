Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix that can be achieved by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation, which assigns a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row, and Type 2 operation, which assigns a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a column. The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in the matrix with no more than 2n operations.

The given program calculates the maximum sum by iterating from 2 to n and adding the difference between the square of the current number and the square of the previous number, multiplied by the current number. This is based on the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by assigning the largest possible numbers to the matrix.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is 2n. It then prints the operations, which are Type 1 and Type 2 operations for each row and column, respectively. The permutations used in the operations are simply the range of numbers from 1 to n.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the maximum sum for the given matrix size n.

Correctness: **True**
