Output State: **The loop has executed t iterations, and for each iteration, it has read an integer n from stdin, calculated a sum using a nested loop, printed the sum and 2n, and then printed 2n lines of output, each containing n+2 integers. The final state of the loop variables is: t is unchanged, n is the last integer read from stdin, sum is the last calculated sum, i is n, and j is n. The stdin stream has been consumed by t integers.**
