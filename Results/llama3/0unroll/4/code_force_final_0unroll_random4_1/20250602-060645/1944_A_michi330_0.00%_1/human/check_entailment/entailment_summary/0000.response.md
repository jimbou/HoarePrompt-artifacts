Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program reads a series of test cases, where each case consists of two integers, n and k, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if k is greater than or equal to n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the program prints 1.

On the other hand, if k is less than n-1, Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can still visit all other islands. In this case, the program prints n-1, which is the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The execution summary confirms that the program processes multiple test cases correctly and prints the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
