Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing either 2 or 3. For each test case, if there exists an index i such that the element at index l[i] - 1 is equal to i + 1, the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be 3. The value of n will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.**
