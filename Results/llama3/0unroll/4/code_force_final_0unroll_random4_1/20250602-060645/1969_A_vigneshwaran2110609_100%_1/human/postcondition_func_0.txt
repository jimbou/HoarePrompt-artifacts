This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n distinct integers. It then checks for each test case if there exists an index i such that the element at index l[i] - 1 is equal to i + 1. If such an index exists, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function repeats this process for all test cases and does not modify the input values.
