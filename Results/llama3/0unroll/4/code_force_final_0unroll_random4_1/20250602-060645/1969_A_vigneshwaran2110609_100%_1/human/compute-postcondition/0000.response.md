Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 50. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, with one less test case than initially, since one test case has been read to assign the value to `n`. The remaining test cases still consist of two lines each: the first line contains an integer `n` between 2 and 50, and the second line contains `n` distinct integers `p_i` between 1 and `n`, where `p_i` is not equal to `i`.
