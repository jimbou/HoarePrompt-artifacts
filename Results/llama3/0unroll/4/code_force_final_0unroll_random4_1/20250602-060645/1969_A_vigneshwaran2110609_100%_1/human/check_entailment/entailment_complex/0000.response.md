Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend the party. The program iterates through each test case, which consists of an integer n followed by a list of n distinct integers. It checks if there exists an index i such that the element at index l[i] - 1 is equal to i + 1. If such an index exists, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if there exists an index i such that the element at index l[i] - 1 is equal to i + 1, it means that the i-th friend and the l[i]-th friend are each other's best friends. In this case, sending invitations to both of them will result in at least 2 friends attending the party, which is the minimum required. If no such index exists, it means that there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, and therefore, at least 3 invitations need to be sent to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
