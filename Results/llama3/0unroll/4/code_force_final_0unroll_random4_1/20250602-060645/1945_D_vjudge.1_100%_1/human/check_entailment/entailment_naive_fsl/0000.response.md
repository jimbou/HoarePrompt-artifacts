Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. It calculates the minimum cost to move to each position from the end of the line to the k-th position, and then finds the minimum cost among these options.

The program uses a suffix array `suff` to store the cumulative minimum cost to move to each position from the end of the line. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum cost to move to each position in the range [0, k].

The program also correctly handles the case where Kirill can move to any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j, by considering the minimum cost to move to each position in the range [0, k].

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
