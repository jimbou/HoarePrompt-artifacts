#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The list suff now contains the cumulative sum of the list c in reverse order, where suff[i] contains the sum of all elements in c from index i to n-1. The values of n, k, a, b, and c remain unchanged.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The variable ans now contains the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range(k), while the values of n, k, a, b, and c, as well as the list suff, remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and suff[i+1] for all i in range(k)

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates and returns the minimum value of the sum of a[i] and the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists a and b, from index i+1 to the end of the lists, for all i in the range of the given integer k. The function takes as input four parameters: two integers n and k, and two lists of integers a and b, each of length n. The function returns the minimum sum value as a single output.
