Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in the queue.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the input values for the number of test cases (t), the number of people in the queue (n), and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m).
2.  It then reads the lists of integers a and b, each of length n.
3.  The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. This function uses list comprehension to create a new list c, where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in lists a and b.
4.  The function then calculates the suffix sum of list c, which represents the cumulative sum of the minimum values from the end of the list to the current index.
5.  The function initializes a variable `ans` to infinity and then iterates over the range of k. For each index i, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between the current `ans` and the sum of a\[i] and the suffix sum at index i+1.
6.  Finally, the function prints the minimum sum value `ans`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
