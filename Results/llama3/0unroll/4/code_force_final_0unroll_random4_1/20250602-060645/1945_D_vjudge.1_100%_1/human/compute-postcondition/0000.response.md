Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, c is a list of integers of length n, where c_i is the minimum of a_i and b_i for all i, suff is a list of n+1 zeros.**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as integers within the specified range. The lists a and b also retain their original lengths and integer values within the given range. The new list c is created by taking the minimum value between corresponding elements in lists a and b, resulting in a list of integers of the same length as a and b. The list suff is initialized with n+1 zeros, with no further modifications.
