Output State: **The output state will contain the number of non-identical elements in each of the t input sequences, excluding the longest sequence of identical elements at the beginning and end of each sequence. If the first and last elements of a sequence are the same, the output will be the maximum of 0 and the length of the sequence minus the sum of the lengths of the longest sequences of identical elements at the beginning and end.**
