Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

6
1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output 5, but the correct answer is 5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has no repeated elements.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for repeated elements at the beginning and end of the array, but it does not check for repeated elements in the middle of the array. This can lead to incorrect results when the array has no repeated elements.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check for repeated elements throughout the entire array, not just at the beginning and end.
