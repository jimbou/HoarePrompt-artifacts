Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, with each 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to a test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed is equal to the number of test cases, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The value of the variable 'tests' remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The stdin is empty as all the test cases have been read and processed.**
