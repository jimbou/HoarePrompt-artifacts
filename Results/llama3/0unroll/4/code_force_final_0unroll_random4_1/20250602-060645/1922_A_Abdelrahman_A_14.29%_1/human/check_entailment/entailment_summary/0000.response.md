Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program first checks if string c is equal to either string a or string b. If it is, then there cannot exist a template t that matches a and b but not c, so it prints 'NO'.

If string c is not equal to either string a or string b, then the program checks if there exists a character in string c that is not present in either string a or string b. If such a character is found, then a template t can be constructed by making all characters in t uppercase except for the character that is not present in a or b, which is made lowercase. This template t will match a and b but not c, so the program prints 'YES'.

If no such character is found in string c, then it means that all characters in c are present in either a or b. In this case, it is not possible to construct a template t that matches a and b but not c, so the program prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and prints the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
