Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c. It then checks if string c contains any characters not present in strings a and b. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints a corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case, without modifying the input variables.**
