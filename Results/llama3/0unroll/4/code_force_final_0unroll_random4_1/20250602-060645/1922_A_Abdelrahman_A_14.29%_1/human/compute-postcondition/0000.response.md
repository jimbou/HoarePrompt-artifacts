The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. After the code is executed, the value of `tests` is equal to the integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
