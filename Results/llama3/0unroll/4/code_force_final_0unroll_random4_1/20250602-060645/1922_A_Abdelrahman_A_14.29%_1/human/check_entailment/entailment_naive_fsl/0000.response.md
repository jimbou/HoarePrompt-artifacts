Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the strings a and b have the same character at a certain position, but the string c has a different character at the same position. In this case, the program should print 'YES' because a template can be created where the character at that position is uppercase, matching a and b but not c. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

3
a
a
b

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because a template 'A' can be created that matches 'a' and 'a' but not 'b'.
