Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program does not correctly handle cases where there are more than two pairs of friends that can attend the party.

The program only checks if there is a pair of friends that can attend the party, and if so, it prints 2. If not, it prints 3. However, this is not sufficient to cover all possible cases. The program needs to check all possible pairs of friends and count the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.
