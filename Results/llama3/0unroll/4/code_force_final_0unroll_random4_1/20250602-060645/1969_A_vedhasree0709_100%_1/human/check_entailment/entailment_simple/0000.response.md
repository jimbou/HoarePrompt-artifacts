Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The program iterates over the list of friends and checks if there exists a pair of friends (p, q) such that q = p + 1. If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and breaks the loop.
3. If no such pair is found, it prints 3.

The logic behind this is that if there exists a pair of friends (p, q) such that q = p + 1, then Monocarp can send invitations to both p and q, and both will come to the party. This is because p's best friend is q, and q's best friend is p, so both will have invitations. This is the minimum number of invitations required to get at least 2 friends to come to the party.

If no such pair is found, then Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to get at least 2 to come to the party. This is because each friend's best friend is distinct, so Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to cover all possible pairs.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to get at least 2 friends to come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
