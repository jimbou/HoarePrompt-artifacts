#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, edges is a list of pairs of positive integers representing the edges of a tree with n nodes, and start is a positive integer representing the starting node. The tree has exactly two leaves.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The tree dictionary now represents an adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with two leaves, based on the parity of the distances from a starting node to each leaf. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges representing the tree, and a starting node, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the distances are even or odd.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, and start and target are valid nodes in the tree.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if a path exists, or -1 if the target node is unreachable from the start node. The function modifies the input tree by marking all reachable nodes from the start node as visited.
