This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if a path exists, or -1 if the target node is unreachable from the start node. The function modifies the input tree by marking all reachable nodes from the start node as visited.
