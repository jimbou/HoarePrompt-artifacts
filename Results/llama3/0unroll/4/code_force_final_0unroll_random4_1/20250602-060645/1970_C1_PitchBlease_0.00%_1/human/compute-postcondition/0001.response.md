Output State: **queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node.**

In this output state, the queue is empty because the loop continues to execute until the queue is empty, at which point all nodes reachable from the start node have been visited. The visited set contains all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node, because each node is added to the visited set when it is dequeued and processed.
