Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the start node is one of the leaves. In this case, the function `func_1` will return 'Ron' if the distance from the start node to the other leaf is even, and 'Hermione' if it is odd. However, this is not correct because if the start node is a leaf, Ron will always win, regardless of the distance to the other leaf.

For example, if the input is:

3 1
2 3
3 1
3

The program will return 'Hermione', but the correct answer is 'Ron'.
