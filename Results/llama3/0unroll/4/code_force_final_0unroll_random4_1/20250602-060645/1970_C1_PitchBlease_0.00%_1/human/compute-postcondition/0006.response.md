Postcondition: **The tree dictionary remains unchanged, representing an adjacency list of the tree. The variable leaves is a list containing two nodes, each with only one neighboring node. The variable dist1 contains the shortest distance from the start node to the first leaf node, and the variable dist2 contains the shortest distance from the start node to the second leaf node. Both dist1 and dist2 are odd numbers.**
