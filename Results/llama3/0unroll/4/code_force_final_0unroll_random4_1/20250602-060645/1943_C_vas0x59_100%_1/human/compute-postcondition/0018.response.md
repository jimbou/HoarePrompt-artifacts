The code prints the vertices and their corresponding indices from the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, based on whether the length of the path is odd or even. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, it prints the middle vertex `c` of `path_ba` and an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). If the length of `path_ba` is even, it prints all the vertices from the first middle vertex to the second middle vertex of `path_ba`, along with their corresponding indices.
Output: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, `ops` is a list of tuples. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, each tuple in `ops` contains the middle vertex `c` of `path_ba` and an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), and `ci` and `c` remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains all the vertices from the first middle vertex to the second middle vertex of `path_ba`, along with their corresponding indices, and the other variables remain unchanged, and the following is printed: the vertices and their corresponding indices from the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, based on whether the length of the path is odd or even.**
