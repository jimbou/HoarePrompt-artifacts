Output State: **path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a.**

The loop starts by initializing the variable n to the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to vertex 0, which is stored in the previous array at the index of the last vertex in the path_ba list. If n is -1, it means that the path has reached vertex 0, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, n is appended to the path_ba list, and the process is repeated until the path reaches vertex 0. As a result, the path_ba list contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a.
