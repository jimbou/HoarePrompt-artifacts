Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, ops is an empty list, ci1 is the index of the first middle vertex of path_ba, ci2 is the index of the second middle vertex of path_ba, c1 is the vertex at index ci1 in path_ba, and c2 is the vertex at index ci2 in path_ba.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
