The code prints the length of the `ops` list, which contains tuples of vertices and their indices along the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the length of `ops` will be equal to `ci + 1`, where `ci` is the index of the middle vertex `c` in `path_ba`. This is because `ops` contains tuples for each index from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).

If the length of `path_ba` is even, the length of `ops` will be equal to the number of vertices from the first middle vertex to the second middle vertex of `path_ba`, along with their corresponding indices.

Output: **the length of ops (which is ci + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or the number of vertices from the first middle vertex to the second middle vertex of path_ba if the length of path_ba is even)**
