The code prints the vertices and their corresponding indices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, with the vertices and indices adjusted according to whether the length of the path is odd or even.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, each tuple in `ops` contains the middle vertex `c` of `path_ba` and an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). The `map` function applies a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`, which formats the vertex and index as a string in the format '{vertex + 1} {index}'. The `*` operator unpacks the map object into separate arguments to the `print` function, and the `sep='\n'` argument causes each string to be printed on a separate line.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains all the vertices from the first middle vertex to the second middle vertex of `path_ba`, along with their corresponding indices. The `map` function and `print` statement work in the same way as in the odd case.

Output: **Vertices and their corresponding indices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, with adjustments based on the length of the path**
