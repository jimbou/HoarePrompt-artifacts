Output State: **The list u2vs now contains n lists where the i-th list contains the indices of the vertices adjacent to vertex i in the graph described by the input. The variable d holds the shortest distance from vertex 0 to all other vertices in the graph. The variable a holds the index of the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex 0. The variable previous holds the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to vertex 0. The variable b holds the index of the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex a. The variable path_ba holds the path from vertex b to vertex a.**

In this output state, the list u2vs remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable d is assigned the shortest distance from vertex 0 to all other vertices in the graph, which is calculated by the bfs function. The variable a is assigned the index of the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex 0, which is calculated by the func_1 function. The variable previous is assigned the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to vertex 0, which is calculated by the bfs function. The variable b is assigned the index of the vertex with the maximum shortest distance from vertex a, which is calculated by the func_1 function. The variable path_ba is assigned the path from vertex b to vertex a, which is initialized with vertex b.
