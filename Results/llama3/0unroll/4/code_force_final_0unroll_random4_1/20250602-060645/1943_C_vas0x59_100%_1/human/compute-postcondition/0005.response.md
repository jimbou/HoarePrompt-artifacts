Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a, `ops` is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `path_ba` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The code only initializes an empty list `ops`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `path_ba` and the newly initialized empty list `ops`.
