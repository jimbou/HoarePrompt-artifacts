Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`, and the cards are `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`. The program will print `2`, but the correct answer is `2` as well. However, if we consider the test case where `n = 1` and `k = 10`, and the card is `[7]`, the program will print `9`, but the correct answer is `1` because no operation can be performed.

The program does not take into account the actual numbers on the cards and the number of cards of each number, which is necessary to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand.
