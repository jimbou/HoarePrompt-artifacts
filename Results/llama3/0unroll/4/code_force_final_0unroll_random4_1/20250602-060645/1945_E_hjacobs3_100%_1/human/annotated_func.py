#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is the index of the largest element in array that is less than or equal to find, r is l + 1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of l + 1, where l is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to find. The second string is the value of the index of find in the array plus 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is the index of the largest element in array that is less than or equal to find, r is l + 1, and l is equal to the index of find in array, and 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a target value 'find' in a list of distinct integers 'array' and returns a list containing the index of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' plus one, as strings. If 'find' is not present in the array, it prints 1 and returns the indices as described. If 'find' is present, it prints 0.
