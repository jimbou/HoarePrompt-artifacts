Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the target value 'find' in the list of distinct integers 'array'. If 'find' is not present in the array, it correctly prints 1 and returns the indices of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' and the index of 'find' as strings. If 'find' is present, it correctly prints 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where 'find' is not present in the array by printing 1 and returning the indices as described. This is because the binary search algorithm will always find the largest element less than or equal to 'find', even if 'find' is not present in the array.

The program also correctly handles the case where 'find' is present in the array by printing 0. This is because the binary search algorithm will always find the index of 'find' in the array, and the program checks if the index of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' is equal to the index of 'find'. If they are equal, it prints 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and will always produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
