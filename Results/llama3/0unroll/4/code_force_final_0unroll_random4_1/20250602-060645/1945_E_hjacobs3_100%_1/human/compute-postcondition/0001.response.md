Output State: **l is the index of the largest element in array that is less than or equal to find, r is l + 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `l` will point to the largest element in the `array` that is less than or equal to the value of `find`. The variable `r` will be one more than `l`, effectively pointing to the next element in the array. This is the result of the binary search algorithm implemented in the loop, which repeatedly narrows down the search range until it finds the desired element or its insertion point.
