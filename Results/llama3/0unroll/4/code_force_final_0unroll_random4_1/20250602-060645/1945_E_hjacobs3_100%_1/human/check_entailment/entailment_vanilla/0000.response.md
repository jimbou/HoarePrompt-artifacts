Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`. It then reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the permutation `array` and the number to be found `find` as input. This function is supposed to determine the minimum number of operations required to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search algorithm can find the number `x`.

4. Inside the `func_1` function, it initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the permutation, respectively. It then enters a loop to perform the binary search.

5. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[l, r]`. If the element at the midpoint `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the number to be found `find`, it updates the left pointer `l` to `mid`. Otherwise, it updates the right pointer `r` to `mid`.

6. After the loop, it checks if the left pointer `l` points to the correct position of the number `x` in the permutation. If not, it means that the permutation needs to be rearranged. In this case, it prints `1` to indicate that one operation is needed, and then returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as the swap operation.

7. If the left pointer `l` already points to the correct position of the number `x`, it means that no operation is needed. In this case, it prints `0`.

8. Finally, the program decrements the test case counter `t` and repeats the process until all test cases are processed.

Based on the above analysis, the program seems to be correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm and determines the minimum number of operations required to rearrange the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
