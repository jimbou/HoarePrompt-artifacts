The function reads input from stdin, expecting pairs of integers until a single integer is encountered, and returns a list of these integer pairs. The function does not perform any validation or processing on the input data beyond parsing it into a list of lists, where each sublist contains two integers. The returned list contains all the integer pairs read from stdin, in the order they were encountered.
