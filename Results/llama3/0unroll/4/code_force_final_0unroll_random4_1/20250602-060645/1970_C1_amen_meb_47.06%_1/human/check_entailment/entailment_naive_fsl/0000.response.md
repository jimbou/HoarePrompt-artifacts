Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a tree of n nodes, where the game starts with a stone on a node and players alternate moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. The program provided does not correctly implement the game logic.

The program reads the input and constructs the tree, but it does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The program uses a simple comparison of the number of nodes on each side of the tree to determine the winner, which is not a correct solution to the problem.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game and determining the winner based on the game's rules. The program does not correctly implement this simulation.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes, where the stone starts on node 3. The correct solution would involve simulating the game and determining the winner based on the game's rules, but the program would incorrectly determine the winner based on the number of nodes on each side of the tree.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
