Functionality: **This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers a and b, where a >= b >= 0. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.**
