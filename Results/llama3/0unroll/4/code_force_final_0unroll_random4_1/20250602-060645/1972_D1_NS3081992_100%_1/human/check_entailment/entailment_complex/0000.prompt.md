Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7().

    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, plus 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each element `di` in `d[da]`, checks if `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and if so, temporarily sets it to 1, calculates a value using the `func_12` function, and then resets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. It keeps track of the minimum value returned by `func_12` and assigns it to `tmp`. Finally, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` at index `da - 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.

    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y, x, and g are the returned values of func_13(b, a % b), where a % b is the remainder of a divided by b. Note that a is an integer, b is an integer, a >= b > 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers a and b, where a >= b >= 0. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating an error or invalid state, as k is less than 0, which means the sum of differences between m and each element in list a that is less than m has exceeded k.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates the sum of differences between a given threshold (m) and each element in a list (a) that is less than the threshold, and checks if this sum exceeds a given limit (k). If the sum does not exceed the limit, the function returns 1, indicating a valid state. If the sum exceeds the limit, the function returns -1, indicating an error or invalid state.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, n and m are the output of function func_7().
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is m + 1, ans is the sum of the floor division of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, n is unchanged, m is unchanged.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of the floor division of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, minus 1, where n and m are unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of the floor division of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, minus 1, where n and m are unchanged.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a non-negative integer and the function func_15() returns a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is equal to the value returned by func_10(). Each string is the result of calling func_15().

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is determined by the return value of func_10(). Each string in the sequence is the result of calling func_15(). The function outputs this sequence to the standard output.
