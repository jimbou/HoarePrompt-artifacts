Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The key insight is that a+b is a multiple of b*gcd(a,b) if and only if a is a multiple of gcd(a,b). This is because b*gcd(a,b) divides both a and b, so it must also divide their sum.

The program uses this insight to iterate over all possible values of i (the gcd of a and b) and count the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. The loop iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to min(n, m), and for each i, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when n or m is 1, and when n and m are equal. It also correctly handles the case when n and m are large, by using an efficient algorithm that runs in O(sqrt(n)) time.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it accurately solves the problem as described.
