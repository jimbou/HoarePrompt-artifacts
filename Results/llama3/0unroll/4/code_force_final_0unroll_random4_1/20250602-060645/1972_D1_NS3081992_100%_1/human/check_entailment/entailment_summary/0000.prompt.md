Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_3() a specified number of times, equal to the value of rows_number, and returns this list.
Function number 5 :

Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line of text from standard input, removes the newline character at the end, and decodes it from bytes to a string using the system's default encoding, returning the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single line of input from the standard input, splits it into two integers separated by a space, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(). The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which determines the number of elements in the returned list. The function returns a list with 'rows' number of elements, where the value of each element is determined by the func_7() function.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads a string from standard input and returns it without modification.
Function number 10 :

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each element `di` in `d[da]`, checks if `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and if so, temporarily sets it to 1, calculates a value using the `func_12` function, and then resets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. It keeps track of the minimum value returned by `func_12` and assigns it to `tmp`. Finally, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` at index `da - 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:

    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers a and b, where a >= b >= 0. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls another function func_13 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function evaluates the sum of differences between a given threshold (m) and each element in a list (a) that is less than the threshold, and checks if this sum exceeds a given limit (k). If the sum does not exceed the limit, the function returns 1, indicating a valid state. If the sum exceeds the limit, the function returns -1, indicating an error or invalid state.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
'''

''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function generates a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is determined by the return value of func_10(). Each string in the sequence is the result of calling func_15(). The function outputs this sequence to the standard output.
