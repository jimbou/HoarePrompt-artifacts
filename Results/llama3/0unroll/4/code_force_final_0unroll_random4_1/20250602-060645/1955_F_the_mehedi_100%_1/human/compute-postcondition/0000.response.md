Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing an integer cnt. The value of cnt for each line is calculated based on the input values of a. If all elements of a are odd, cnt is incremented by 1. Then, for each element x in a, cnt is incremented by the integer division of x by 2. The final value of cnt is printed for each iteration of the loop.**
