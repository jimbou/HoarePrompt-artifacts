Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program first checks if all four input integers are odd. If they are, it increments the count by 1, because in this case, Bob can win when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

Then, for each input integer, the program adds the integer division of the value by 2 to the count. This is because for each pair of numbers with the same value, Bob can win once if Eve removes one of them.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
