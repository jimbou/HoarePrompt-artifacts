Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the favorite cube is at the k-th position after sorting, and there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are also at the k-th position or higher. In this case, the program should output "MAYBE", but it outputs "YES" instead.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube (3) is at the k-th position (2) after sorting, and there is another cube with the same value (3) that is also at the k-th position or higher.

The correct logic for this case is to check if there are other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are also at the k-th position or higher. If there are, then the output should be "MAYBE". Otherwise, the output should be "YES" if the favorite cube is at the k-th position or higher, or "NO" if it is not.
