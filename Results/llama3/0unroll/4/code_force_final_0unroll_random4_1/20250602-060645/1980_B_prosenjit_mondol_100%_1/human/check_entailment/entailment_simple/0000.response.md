Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program iterates over multiple test cases.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3.  It subtracts 1 from `f` and `k` to adjust for 0-based indexing.
4.  It reads the values shown on the cubes into a list `a`.
5.  It stores the value of the favorite cube in `x`.
6.  It sorts the list `a` in descending order.
7.  It checks the value of the cube at index `k` (the `k`-th largest cube) and compares it with the value of the favorite cube `x`.

The program's logic is correct:

*   If the `k`-th largest cube is greater than the favorite cube, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed.
*   If the `k`-th largest cube is less than the favorite cube, it prints "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed.
*   If the `k`-th largest cube is equal to the favorite cube, it checks if `k` is equal to `n - 1` (i.e., the favorite cube is the last cube) or if the next cube is less than the favorite cube. If either condition is true, it prints "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed. Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
