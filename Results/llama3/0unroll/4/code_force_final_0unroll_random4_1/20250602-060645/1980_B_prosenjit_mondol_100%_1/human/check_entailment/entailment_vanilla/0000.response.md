Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k). It then subtracts 1 from f and k because list indices in Python start at 0.

3. The program then reads the values shown on the cubes and stores them in a list (a).

4. It finds the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (x) by accessing the list at index f.

5. The list (a) is then sorted in non-increasing order.

6. The program checks if the value of the k-th cube (after sorting) is greater than the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (x). If it is, then Dmitry's favorite cube will not be removed in any case, so it prints 'NO'.

7. If the value of the k-th cube is less than the value of Dmitry's favorite cube, then Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, so it prints 'YES'.

8. If the value of the k-th cube is equal to the value of Dmitry's favorite cube, then the program checks if k is equal to n - 1 (i.e., all cubes with the same value as the favorite cube are removed) or if the value of the (k + 1)-th cube is less than the value of the favorite cube (i.e., there are no more cubes with the same value as the favorite cube after the k-th cube). If either condition is true, then Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may be either removed or left.

Correctness: **True**
