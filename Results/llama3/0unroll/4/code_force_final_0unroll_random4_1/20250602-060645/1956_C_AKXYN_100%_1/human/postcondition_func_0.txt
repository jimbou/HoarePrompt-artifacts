The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t), followed by t integers (n), each representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, the function calculates a result (res) based on the size of the matrix (n) and prints the result along with the value of n shifted left by 1 bit. Then, for each test case, the function prints two lines of numbers from 1 to n, with the first line starting with '1' and the second line starting with '2', repeating this pattern for each input value of n. The function outputs a series of lines, with each line containing a string of numbers, where the first line contains two numbers, and the subsequent lines contain strings of numbers from 1 to n, repeating this pattern for each input value of n.
