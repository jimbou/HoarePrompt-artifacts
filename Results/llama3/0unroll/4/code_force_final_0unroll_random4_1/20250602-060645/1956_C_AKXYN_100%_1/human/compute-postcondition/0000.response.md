Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing a string of numbers. The first line contains two numbers, the second line contains a string of numbers from 1 to n, and the third line contains another string of numbers from 1 to n. This pattern repeats for each input value of n. The number of lines in the output state is 3 times the number of input values of n.**
