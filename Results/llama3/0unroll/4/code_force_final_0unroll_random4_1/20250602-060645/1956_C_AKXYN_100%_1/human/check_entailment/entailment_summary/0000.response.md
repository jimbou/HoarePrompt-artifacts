Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the result along with the operations to achieve this sum.

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum by using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that maximizes their contribution to the sum.

The program also correctly prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum. For each test case, it prints two lines of numbers from 1 to n, with the first line starting with '1' and the second line starting with '2'. This corresponds to the two types of operations allowed in the problem: Type 1 operation, which assigns a permutation to a row, and Type 2 operation, which assigns a permutation to a column.

The program uses a loop to repeat this process for each input value of n, and it correctly handles the case where n is 1.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
