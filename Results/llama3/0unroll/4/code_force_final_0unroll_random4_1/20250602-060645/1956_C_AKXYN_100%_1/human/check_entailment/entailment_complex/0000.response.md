Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the required operations to achieve this sum.

The program first initializes a matrix with numbers from 1 to n in each row. It then calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by summing up the products of each row number and the sum of numbers in that row.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum, which is 2n. It then prints the operations required to achieve this sum, which involves printing two lines of numbers from 1 to n for each row and column of the matrix.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case from standard input, and prints the maximum sum and the required operations for each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
