Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation, which assigns a permutation to a row, and Type 2 operation, which assigns a permutation to a column.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and initializes a matrix (mat) with all elements set to their respective row numbers (from 1 to n).

3. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of all numbers in the matrix. This is done by summing up the products of each row number (i + 1) and the sum of the first (2 * i + 1) odd numbers. This is based on the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by assigning the largest possible numbers to each row and column.

4. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (which is 2n).

5. Finally, it prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each row (from n to 1), it prints a Type 1 operation that assigns the numbers from 1 to n to the current row, and a Type 2 operation that assigns the numbers from 1 to n to the current column.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
