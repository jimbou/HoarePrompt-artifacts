#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: i is equal to n, counter is equal to the number of mismatched pairs of characters in s1 and s2, s1 and s2 remain unchanged.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of mismatched pairs of characters in strings s1 and s2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two strings of equal length consisting of '0' and '1' characters and a positive integer representing the length of the strings as input. It compares the characters at each position in the two strings, counting the number of mismatched pairs. If a mismatch is found, it checks the next pair of characters and increments the count if they are also mismatched and the current character is different from the next character in the first string. The function returns the total count of mismatched pairs. The input strings remain unchanged.
