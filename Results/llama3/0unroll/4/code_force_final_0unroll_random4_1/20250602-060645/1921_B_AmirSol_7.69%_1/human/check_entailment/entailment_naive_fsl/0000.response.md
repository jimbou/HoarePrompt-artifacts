Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
000
111
```

The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. The program is not considering the case where a cat can be moved from one box to another in a single operation. 

In this case, the program is not considering the optimal solution where we can move a cat from one box to another in a single operation, instead of removing a cat and then adding a new one. 

The correct solution should consider the number of cats that need to be added or removed, and the number of cats that can be moved from one box to another in a single operation. 

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    add = 0
    remove = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            remove += 1
        elif s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1':
            add += 1
    return max(add, remove)
```

This solution first counts the number of cats that need to be added and removed, and then returns the maximum of these two counts, which is the minimum number of operations required.
