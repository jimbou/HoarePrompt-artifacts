Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, counter is 0, i is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `counter` and `i`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables.
