Output State: **i is equal to n, counter is equal to the number of mismatched pairs of characters in s1 and s2, s1 and s2 remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop counter `i` has reached the end of the strings `s1` and `s2`, and the `counter` variable has been incremented for each pair of mismatched characters in `s1` and `s2`. The strings `s1` and `s2` themselves remain unchanged.
