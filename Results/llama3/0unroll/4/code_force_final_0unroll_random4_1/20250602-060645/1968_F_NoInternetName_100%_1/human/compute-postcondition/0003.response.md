Output State: The list x remains unchanged, as the loop only accesses and compares elements in x, but does not modify them. The dictionary inds also remains unchanged, as the loop only accesses the values in inds, but does not modify them. The loop prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration, but this does not affect the state of x or inds. The length of list x is still equal to the length of list a plus one, and the length of the list of indices for each key in inds is still equal to the number of times that key appears in x.
