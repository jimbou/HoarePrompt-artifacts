Output State: **n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, func_1 and func_4 are functions that return a list of integers and an integer respectively, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, and the value of this key is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code executes as follows:

1. `n, q = func_1(int)`: This line assigns the return value of `func_1(int)` to `n` and `q`. Since `func_1` returns a list of integers, `n` and `q` become positive integers.

2. `a = list(func_1(int))`: This line assigns the return value of `func_1(int)` to `a`. Since `func_1` returns a list of integers, `a` becomes a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30.

3. `x = [0]`: This line assigns a list containing a single element 0 to `x`.

4. `inds = defaultdict(list)`: This line creates a new dictionary `inds` with default values as empty lists.

5. `inds[0].append(0)`: This line appends 0 to the list associated with the key 0 in the `inds` dictionary.

The final state of the program includes the initial state of `n`, `q`, `a`, `func_1`, and `func_4`, as well as the new values assigned to `x` and `inds`.
