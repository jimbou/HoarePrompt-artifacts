Functionality: **This function takes no parameters and returns no value. It performs the following actions: 

1. It calls the function func_1 twice to get two positive integers n and q, and a list of non-negative integers a. 
2. It generates a list x of XOR values of consecutive elements in list a, and a dictionary inds where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x. 
3. It then iterates q times, each time taking two integers l and r as input from the function func_1. 
4. For each iteration, it checks if the XOR value at index l-1 is equal to the XOR value at index r. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. 
5. If the XOR values are not equal, it finds the smallest index greater than or equal to l where the XOR value is equal to the XOR value at index r, and the largest index less than or equal to r where the XOR value is equal to the XOR value at index l-1. 
6. If the largest index is greater than the smallest index, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The final state of the program is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed results of the loop iterations.**
