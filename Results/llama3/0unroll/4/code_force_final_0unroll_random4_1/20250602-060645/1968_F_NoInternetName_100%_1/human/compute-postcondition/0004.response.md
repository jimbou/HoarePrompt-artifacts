Output State: The loop has executed q iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The state of the variables x, inds, and a remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed results of the loop iterations.
