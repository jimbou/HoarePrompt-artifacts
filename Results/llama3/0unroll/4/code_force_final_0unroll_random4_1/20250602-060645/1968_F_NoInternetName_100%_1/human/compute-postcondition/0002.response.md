Output State: The list x contains a sequence of integers where each element is the XOR of the previous element and the corresponding element in list a. The dictionary inds contains the indices of the elements in list x, where each key is an element in x and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that element appears in x. The length of list x is equal to the length of list a plus one, and the length of the list of indices for each key in inds is equal to the number of times that key appears in x.
