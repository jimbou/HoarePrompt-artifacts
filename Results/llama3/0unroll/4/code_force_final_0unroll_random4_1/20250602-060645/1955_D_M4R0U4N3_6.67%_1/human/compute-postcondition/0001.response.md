Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, the second line contains n integers a_1 to a_n, and the third line contains m integers b_1 to b_m. The function then determines the number of times a condition is met, where the condition is that at least k elements from the set of m integers b_1 to b_m are found within a sliding window of size m in the list of n integers a_1 to a_n. The function prints the count of times this condition is met for each test case.**
