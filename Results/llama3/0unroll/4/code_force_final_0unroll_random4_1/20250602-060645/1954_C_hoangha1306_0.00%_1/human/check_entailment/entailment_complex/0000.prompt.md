Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()

        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:

                x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: The loop will print 2t strings, where each pair of strings consists of the same digits, but with the first occurrence of a mismatched digit swapped. The remaining digits are appended in the order they appear in the original strings. The value of t remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings of digits a and b of the same length. It then generates two new strings, kq1 and kq2, by comparing the digits of a and b from left to right. When a mismatch is found, the function swaps the mismatched digits in kq1 and kq2, and appends the remaining digits in the order they appear in the original strings. The function prints the resulting strings kq1 and kq2 for each test case.
