Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000, which was read from the input. The stdin still contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. The value of `t` is now known and is used to describe the remaining input in the stdin.
