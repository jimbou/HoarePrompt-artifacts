Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `m` is equal to `a` or `b`. In this case, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `m // a + m // b + 1` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on whether `a` and `b` are equal or not.

For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `m = 5`, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer is `3` because there are three fireworks visible in the sky at the same time: one launched at time `0`, one launched at time `5`, and one launched at time `10`.

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing `m` by `a` and `b` and adding `2`.
