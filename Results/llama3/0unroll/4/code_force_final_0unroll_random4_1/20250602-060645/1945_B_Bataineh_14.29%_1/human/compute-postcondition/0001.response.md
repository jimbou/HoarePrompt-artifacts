Output State: **The output will be a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required to make 'a' and 'b' equal to 'm'. If 'm' is less than either 'a' or 'b', the output will be 2, otherwise, it will be the sum of 'm' divided by 'a', 'm' divided by 'b', and 2. The number of integers in the output will be equal to the value of 't'.**
