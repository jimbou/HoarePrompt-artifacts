This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the number of boxes, the initial state of the boxes (cats or no cats), and the target state of the boxes. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cats that need to be moved to achieve the target state, considering the cases where the number of cats in the initial and target states are equal or different. The function iterates through all test cases and outputs the result for each case.
