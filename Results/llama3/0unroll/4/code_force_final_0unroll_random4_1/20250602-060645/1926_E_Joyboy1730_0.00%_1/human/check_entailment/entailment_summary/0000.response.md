Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the program constructs the list `L` and the calculation of the `k`-th card.

In the problem description, Vladislav lays down the cards in a specific order, first by odd numbers, then by multiples of 2, then by multiples of 3, and so on. However, in the given program, the list `L` is constructed by calculating the number of odd numbers in the range `[1, n]`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the multiples of 2, 3, and so on.

Moreover, the calculation of the `k`-th card is also incorrect. The program calculates `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, which is not the correct formula to calculate the `k`-th card in the sequence.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to construct the list `L` by iterating over the powers of 2 and calculating the number of cards that are multiples of each power of 2. Then, we need to find the correct formula to calculate the `k`-th card in the sequence.

Correctness: **False**
