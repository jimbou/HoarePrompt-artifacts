Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of cards that are multiples of a certain power of 2. The program uses the formula `m = (n + 1) // 2` to calculate the number of cards that are multiples of the current power of 2, but this formula is incorrect.

For example, when `n = 10` and `k = 6`, the program will calculate `m = (10 + 1) // 2 = 5`, which means it will consider the cards 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 as multiples of 2. However, the correct calculation should be `m = 10 // 2 = 5`, which means the cards 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are indeed multiples of 2, but the program will incorrectly consider the card 10 as a multiple of 2 twice.

This incorrect calculation will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
