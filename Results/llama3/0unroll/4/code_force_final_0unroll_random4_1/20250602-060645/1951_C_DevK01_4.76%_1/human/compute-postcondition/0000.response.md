Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
