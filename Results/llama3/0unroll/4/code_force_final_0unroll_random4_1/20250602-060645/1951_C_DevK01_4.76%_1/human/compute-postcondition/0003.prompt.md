You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables after the last iteration. The variables t, L, M, n, m, k, q, N, and cost have been updated according to the loop body. The final values of these variables are:
    #
    #* t: 0 (since the loop has executed all iterations)
    #* L: The last list of integers read from stdin, containing three integers n, m, and k.
    #* M: The last list of integers read from stdin, containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
    #* n: The number of sale days in the last test case.
    #* m: The minimum of the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought at the end in the last test case.
    #* k: The number of tickets to be bought at the end in the last test case.
    #* q: The number of days needed to buy k tickets in the last test case.
    #* N: The sorted list of prices per ticket for the first q days in the last test case.
    #* cost: The total cost of buying k tickets in the last test case.
    #
    #The output state is the final state of these variables after the last iteration of the loop.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
