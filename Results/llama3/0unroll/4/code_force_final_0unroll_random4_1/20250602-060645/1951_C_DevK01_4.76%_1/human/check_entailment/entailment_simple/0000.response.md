Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, t, and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days, n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, m, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end, k.

3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.

4. The program sorts the list M in ascending order, which is correct because we want to buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.

5. It then calculates the number of days needed to buy k tickets, q, by dividing k by m and rounding up to the nearest integer. This is correct because we can buy at most m tickets per day.

6. The program then creates a new list N by taking the first q elements from the sorted list M. This is correct because we want to consider the prices of the first q days.

7. If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days is equal to k, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the sum of the prices in N by m and adding the sum of the prices multiplied by the number of days. This is correct because we are buying m tickets per day for q days.

8. If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days is not equal to k, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the last price in N by the remaining number of tickets, adding the sum of the prices in N multiplied by m, and adding the sum of the prices multiplied by the number of days. This is correct because we are buying the remaining tickets on the last day.

9. Finally, the program prints the total cost.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
