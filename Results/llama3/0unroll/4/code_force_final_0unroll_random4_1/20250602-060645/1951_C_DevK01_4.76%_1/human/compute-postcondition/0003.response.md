Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains three integers: the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains the price per ticket for each of the upcoming sale days. The function calculates the total cost of buying the specified number of tickets, considering the minimum of the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought at the end. It sorts the prices per ticket for the first q days, where q is the number of days needed to buy the specified number of tickets, and calculates the total cost based on the sorted prices. The function prints the total cost for each test case.**
