Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets by considering the minimum of the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought at the end. It sorts the prices per ticket for the first q days, where q is the number of days needed to buy the specified number of tickets, and calculates the total cost based on the sorted prices. The program handles the cases where the number of days needed to buy the specified number of tickets is equal to the number of sale days and where it is not equal. The program also correctly calculates the total cost by considering the increased prices per ticket for the remaining days after purchasing tickets on each day.

Correctness: **True**
