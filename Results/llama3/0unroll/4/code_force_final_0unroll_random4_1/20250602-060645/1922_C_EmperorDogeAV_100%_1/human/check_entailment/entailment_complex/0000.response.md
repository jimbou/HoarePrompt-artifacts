Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum distance between each city and its closest neighbor, and the main program correctly uses these distances to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities.

The program also correctly handles the case where the closest city is the previous or next city, and it correctly calculates the prefix sums to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
