Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between consecutive cities in both forward and backward directions.

The function `func_1` is used to calculate the closest city for each city. It iterates through the list of cities and for each city, it checks if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city. If it is, then the closest city is the next city and the distance is 1. Otherwise, the closest city is the previous city and the distance is the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city.

The prefix sum of the distances between consecutive cities is calculated using the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists. These lists store the cumulative sum of the distances between consecutive cities in the forward and backward directions, respectively.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls the `func_1` function to calculate the closest cities, and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances. It then reads the queries and for each query, it checks if the source city is less than the destination city. If it is, then it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from the source city to the destination city using the `pref_sum_f` list. Otherwise, it uses the `pref_sum_b` list.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
