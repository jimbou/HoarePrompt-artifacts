Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly determines the closest city to each city and calculates the cost of traveling to that city. It handles the edge cases where a city is at the beginning or end of the list.

2. The program correctly calculates the prefix sum of the costs of traveling to each city in both the forward and backward directions. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of traveling between any two cities.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the source city is less than the destination city and vice versa.

4. The program correctly prints the minimum cost of traveling between each pair of cities.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all edge cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
