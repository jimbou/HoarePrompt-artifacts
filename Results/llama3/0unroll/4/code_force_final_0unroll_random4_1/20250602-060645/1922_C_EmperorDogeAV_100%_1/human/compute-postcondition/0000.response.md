Output State: **cities is a list of n unique integers in ascending order, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros**

In this output state, the list `prog_cities` has been initialized with `n-1` zeros, where `n` is the number of unique integers in the list `cities`. The list `cities` remains unchanged, still containing `n` unique integers in ascending order. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
