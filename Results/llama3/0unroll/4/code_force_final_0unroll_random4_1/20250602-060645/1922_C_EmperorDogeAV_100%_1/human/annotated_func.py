    #State: Output State: prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list cities.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of unique integers in ascending order and returns a new list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the original list, depending on which difference is smaller.
