Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), t is a string, x is an empty list, y is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a string because the `input()` function in Python returns a string. The values of `x` and `y` are empty lists because they were initialized as such. The stdin still contains the same input as before because the code does not consume or modify it.
