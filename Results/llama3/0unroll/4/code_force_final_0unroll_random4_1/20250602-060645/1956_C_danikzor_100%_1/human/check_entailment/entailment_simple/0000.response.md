Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and calculates the maximum sum of numbers that can be achieved in the matrix. This is done by printing the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, which is a well-known mathematical formula.

The program then prints the number of operations required to achieve this maximum sum, which is 2n. It then enters a loop that runs 2n times, where in each iteration, it prints two lines. The first line represents a Type 1 operation, where it assigns a permutation of numbers from n to 1 to a row of the matrix. The second line represents a Type 2 operation, where it assigns the same permutation to a column of the matrix.

The key insight here is that by assigning the permutation of numbers from n to 1 to both rows and columns, the program is effectively maximizing the sum of numbers in the matrix. This is because the largest numbers are being assigned to the positions that will contribute the most to the sum.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
