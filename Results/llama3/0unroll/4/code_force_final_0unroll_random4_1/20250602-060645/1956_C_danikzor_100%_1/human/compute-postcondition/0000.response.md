Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, since one test case has been read and assigned to `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
