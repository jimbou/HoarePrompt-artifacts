Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The program first calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, which is the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers.

Then, it prints 2n lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers. The first number in each line is either 1 or 2, indicating the type of operation. The second number is a value from 1 to n (inclusive), indicating the row or column the operation is applied to. The remaining numbers are a sequence of numbers from n to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order, representing the permutation used in the operation.

The program correctly generates the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. It uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the permutations, which is to use the reverse order of the numbers from n to 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
