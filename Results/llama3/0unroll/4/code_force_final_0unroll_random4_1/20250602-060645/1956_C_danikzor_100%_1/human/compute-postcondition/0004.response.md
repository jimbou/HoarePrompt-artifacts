Functionality: **The function generates and prints a sequence of lines based on a given positive integer n, representing the size of a matrix. It first prints the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers and 2 times the value of n. Then, it prints 2n lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers. The first number in each line is either 1 or 2, the second number is a value from 1 to n (inclusive), and the remaining numbers are a sequence of numbers from n to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order.**
