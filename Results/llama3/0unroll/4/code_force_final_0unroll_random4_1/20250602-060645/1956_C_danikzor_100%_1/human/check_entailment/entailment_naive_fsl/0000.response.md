Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix, but the program does not guarantee this. 

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs:

9 6
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3 2 1
1 3 3 2 1
2 3 3 2 1

However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be:

9 6
1 1 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
2 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
2 3 1 2 3

This solution has a sum of 21, which is greater than the sum of 15 produced by the program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
