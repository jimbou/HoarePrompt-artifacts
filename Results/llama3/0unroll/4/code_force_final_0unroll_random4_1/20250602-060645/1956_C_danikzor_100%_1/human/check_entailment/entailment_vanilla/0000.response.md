Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix n and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum is achieved when the numbers in the matrix are arranged in a specific pattern, with the largest numbers in the center of the matrix and the smallest numbers at the edges.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it, which is 2n. It then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each operation, it prints the type of operation (1 for row or 2 for column), the row or column number, and the permutation of integers from 1 to n.

The permutation is generated using the range function with a step of -1, which generates a sequence of numbers from n to 1 in reverse order. This permutation is used to assign the numbers to the row or column of the matrix.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem, and the calculations are correct. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
