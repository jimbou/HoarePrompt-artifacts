Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sequence of lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers. The first number in each line is either 1 or 2, the second number is a value from 1 to n (inclusive), and the remaining numbers are a sequence of numbers from n to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order. The total number of lines is 2n.**
