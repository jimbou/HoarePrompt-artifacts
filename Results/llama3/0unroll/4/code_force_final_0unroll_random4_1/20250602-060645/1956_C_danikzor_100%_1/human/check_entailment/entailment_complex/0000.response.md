Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6, and the maximum sum can be achieved by assigning the largest possible numbers to the matrix.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (2 * n) required to achieve this sum. It then generates and prints the sequence of operations, where each operation involves assigning a permutation of numbers from n to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order to a row or column of the matrix.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given problem. The use of the formula to calculate the maximum sum and the generation of the sequence of operations are both correct.

Correctness: **True**
