The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the value of `2 * n`. 

The value of `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is the formula for the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers, and the value of `2 * n` is twice the value of `n`.

Output: **the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, 2 times the value of n (where n is a positive integer)**
