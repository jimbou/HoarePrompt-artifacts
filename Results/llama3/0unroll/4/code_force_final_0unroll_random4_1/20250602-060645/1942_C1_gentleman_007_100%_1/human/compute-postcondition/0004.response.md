Output State: **The variable `l` contains the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in reverse order, and `i` and `j` are both equal to 0.**

In this output state, the variable `l` contains the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in reverse order. This is because the loop iterates through the `dp` table in reverse, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving up and left. When it finds a cell where the value is not equal to the value in the cell above or to the left, it means that the current element in `a` is part of the longest common subsequence, so it appends it to the list `l`. The variables `i` and `j` are both equal to 0 because the loop continues until it reaches the top-left corner of the `dp` table.
