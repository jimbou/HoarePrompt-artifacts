Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `mod` is -1, `dearr` is a list containing the integers 1, 0, and the rest of the elements are the result of the recurrence relation `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. Otherwise, `dearr` contains the first `n` Fibonacci numbers modulo `mod`, where the first two elements are 1 and 0, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous two elements modulo `mod`.***
