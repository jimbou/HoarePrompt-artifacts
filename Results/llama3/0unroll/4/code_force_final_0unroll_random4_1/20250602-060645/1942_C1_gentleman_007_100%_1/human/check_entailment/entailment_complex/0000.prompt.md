Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of the largest element that is less than or equal to a given target value. If the target value is less than the smallest element in the list, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the largest element that meets the condition.

    #The program returns the index of the smallest element in p that is greater than or equal to x.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of the smallest element that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the given integer is larger than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list.

    #State: l is the smallest integer greater than the square root of x, r is the largest integer less than the square root of x, x remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the integer square root of a non-negative integer x. If x is 0 or 1, it returns x. Otherwise, it returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

#Function 21:

    return ans
    #The program returns the value of ans, which is the result of a^b % mod, where a is a^(2^k) % mod and b is 0, and k is the number of iterations of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the result of a^b modulo mod, where a and b are integers and mod is a positive integer. It returns the result of this calculation, effectively performing modular exponentiation. The function modifies the input values of a and b during the calculation, but the returned result only depends on the original values of a, b, and mod.

#Function 22:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of elements of any type and value, and the elements in a and b are hashable.

    #State: The variable `l` contains the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in reverse order, and `i` and `j` are both equal to 0.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in the reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists of hashable elements as input and returns the longest common subsequence between them as a string. The function does not modify the input lists. It constructs a 2D list to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this information to build the longest common subsequence in reverse order, which is then reversed before being returned.

#Function 23:

        else:
            l[pos] = i
        
    #State: l is a sorted list of integers, all integers in the list are distinct and represent the vertices of a polygon that Bessie has chosen, arr remains unchanged.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the number of vertices in the polygon that Bessie has chosen, which is equal to the number of distinct integers in the sorted list `l`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of distinct integers representing the vertices of a polygon as input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the number of unique vertices in the sorted list, effectively counting the number of vertices in the polygon.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a valid vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent vertices, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents the visit status of vertex i.
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):

        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The stack is empty, and all vertices connected to the initial vertex ver are marked as visited (vis[node] is 1 for all nodes in the graph connected to ver).
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the stack will be empty because all vertices have been popped and processed. Additionally, all vertices that are connected to the initial vertex ver will be marked as visited, indicating that they have been explored during the loop's execution. The graph and other vertices that are not connected to ver remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first traversal of a graph starting from a given vertex, marking all visited vertices and printing them in the order they are visited. It leaves the graph unchanged and only modifies the visit status of vertices connected to the initial vertex.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents the visit status of node i.
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: q is an empty deque, vis is a list where all elements are 1, and the console output is a string of all nodes in the graph separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and prints all nodes in the graph to the console. It also updates a visit status list to mark all nodes as visited. The function does not return any value, but modifies the visit status list and prints the nodes to the console.
