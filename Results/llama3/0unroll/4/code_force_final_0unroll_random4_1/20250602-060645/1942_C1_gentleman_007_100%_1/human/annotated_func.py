            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: The variable `l` contains the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in reverse order, and `i` and `j` are both equal to 0.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in the reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists of hashable elements as input and returns the longest common subsequence between them as a string. The function does not modify the input lists. It constructs a 2D list to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this information to build the longest common subsequence in reverse order, which is then reversed before being returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, all integers in the list are distinct and represent the vertices of a polygon that Bessie has chosen.
    l = []
    for i in arr:
        pos = bisect_left(l, i)
        
        if pos == len(l):
            l.append(i)
        else:
            l[pos] = i
        
    #State: l is a sorted list of integers, all integers in the list are distinct and represent the vertices of a polygon that Bessie has chosen, arr remains unchanged.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the number of vertices in the polygon that Bessie has chosen, which is equal to the number of distinct integers in the sorted list `l`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of distinct integers representing the vertices of a polygon as input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the number of unique vertices in the sorted list, effectively counting the number of vertices in the polygon.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a valid vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent vertices, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents the visit status of vertex i.
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The stack is empty, and all vertices connected to the initial vertex ver are marked as visited (vis[node] is 1 for all nodes in the graph connected to ver).
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the stack will be empty because all vertices have been popped and processed. Additionally, all vertices that are connected to the initial vertex ver will be marked as visited, indicating that they have been explored during the loop's execution. The graph and other vertices that are not connected to ver remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first traversal of a graph starting from a given vertex, marking all visited vertices and printing them in the order they are visited. It leaves the graph unchanged and only modifies the visit status of vertices connected to the initial vertex.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents the visit status of node i.
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: q is an empty deque, vis is a list where all elements are 1, and the console output is a string of all nodes in the graph separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and prints all nodes in the graph to the console. It also updates a visit status list to mark all nodes as visited. The function does not return any value, but modifies the visit status list and prints the nodes to the console.
