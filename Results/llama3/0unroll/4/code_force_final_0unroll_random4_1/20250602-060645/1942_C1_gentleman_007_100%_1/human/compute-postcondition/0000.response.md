Output State: **ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing the node ver, and vis is a list where vis[ver] is 1 and all other elements remain unchanged.**

In this final state, the code has created a new deque `q` and appended the node `ver` to it. The visit status of node `ver` has been set to 1 in the list `vis`, indicating that it has been visited. All other elements in the list `vis` remain unchanged. The graph and its neighboring nodes, as represented by the dictionary `graph`, remain unaffected by the code.
