You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a valid vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent vertices, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents the visit status of vertex i.
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The stack is empty, and all vertices connected to the initial vertex ver are marked as visited (vis[node] is 1 for all nodes in the graph connected to ver).
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the stack will be empty because all vertices have been popped and processed. Additionally, all vertices that are connected to the initial vertex ver will be marked as visited, indicating that they have been explored during the loop's execution. The graph and other vertices that are not connected to ver remain unchanged.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
