This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i+1` for all `i` in range(len(Prime_array)). It returns a dictionary `d` where `d[x]` is the highest power of `x` that divides the initial value of `num` for each prime factor `x` of the initial value of `num`. The function modifies the input `num` to 1 and leaves `Prime_array` unchanged.
