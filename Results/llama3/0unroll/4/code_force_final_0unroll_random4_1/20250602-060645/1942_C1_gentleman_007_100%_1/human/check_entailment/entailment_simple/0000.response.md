Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program correctly reads the input, sorts the chosen vertices, and calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The program also handles the special cases where the chosen vertices are consecutive or form a triangle with the first and last vertices. The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
