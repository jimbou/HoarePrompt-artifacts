Output State: **q is an empty deque, vis is a list where all elements are 1, and the console output is a string of all nodes in the graph separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the queue `q` will be empty because all nodes have been processed. The `vis` list will have all elements set to 1, indicating that all nodes have been visited. The console output will be a string of all nodes in the graph, separated by spaces, in the order they were visited.
