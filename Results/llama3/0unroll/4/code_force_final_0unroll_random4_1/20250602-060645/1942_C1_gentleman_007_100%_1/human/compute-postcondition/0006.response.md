Output State: **The program returns the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b` in the reverse order.**

This output state is a string that contains the longest common subsequence between lists `a` and `b`, but in the reverse order. The original order of the longest common subsequence is stored in variable `s`, and the code `s[::-1]` reverses this order.
