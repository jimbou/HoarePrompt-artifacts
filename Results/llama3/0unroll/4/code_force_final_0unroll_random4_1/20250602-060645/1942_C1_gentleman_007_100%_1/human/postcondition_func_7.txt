The function accepts a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list of integers, where each element represents the cumulative sum of all elements in the corresponding submatrix of the input list. The output list has one more row and column than the input list, with each element p[i][j] representing the sum of all elements in the submatrix from (0,0) to (i-1,j-1).
