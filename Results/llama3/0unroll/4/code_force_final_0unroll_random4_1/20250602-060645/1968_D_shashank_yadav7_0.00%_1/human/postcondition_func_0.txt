This function determines the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given conditions for multiple test cases. It accepts the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists of integers (p and a) as input. The function then calculates the values of 'bm' and 'sm' based on the given conditions and prints the winner as either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the calculated values. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
