Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the scores of Bodya and Sasha are calculated. The program tries to calculate the maximum possible score for each player by considering the maximum of the current score and the score that can be obtained by staying at the current position for the remaining turns. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual moves made by the players.

In the game, each player can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation. The program does not correctly simulate these moves and calculate the scores accordingly.

For example, in the first test case, Bodya's initial position is 3 and Sasha's initial position is 2. The program calculates Bodya's score as 5 + 5 = 10 and Sasha's score as 2 + 7 = 9. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the actual moves made by the players. Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, but Sasha moves to position 1 in the first turn and stays at position 1 in the second turn. Therefore, Sasha's score should be 2 + 7 + 7 = 16, not 2 + 7 = 9.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the actual moves made by the players and calculate their scores accordingly. We can do this by iterating over the permutation and updating the positions and scores of the players at each step.

Correctness: **False**
