stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S (1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers p_1,...,p_n (1 <= p_i <= n). The third line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
