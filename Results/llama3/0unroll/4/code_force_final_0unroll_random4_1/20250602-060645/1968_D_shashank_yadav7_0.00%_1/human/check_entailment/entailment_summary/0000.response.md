Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given conditions. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the scores of both players and determines the winner based on the calculated scores.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The program does not correctly handle the case when the game lasts for more than `n` turns, where `n` is the length of the permutation. In such cases, the program should continue to update the scores of both players based on the permutation and the array `a`.

2.  The program does not correctly calculate the scores of both players. The scores should be calculated based on the permutation and the array `a`, and the program should consider the maximum score that can be achieved by each player.

3.  The program does not correctly handle the case when the scores of both players are equal. In such cases, the program should print "Draw".

Correctness: **False**
