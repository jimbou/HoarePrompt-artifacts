Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S (1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers p_1,...,p_n (1 <= p_i <= n). The third line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines with the specified constraints. The values of the other variables are not affected.
