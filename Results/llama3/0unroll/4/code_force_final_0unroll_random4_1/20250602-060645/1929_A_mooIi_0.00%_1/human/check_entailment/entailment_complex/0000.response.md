Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order.

The provided Python program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function and prints the sorted integers to standard output, one test case per line.

However, the program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it simply prints the sorted integers. The beauty of the array can be calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not calculate the beauty of the array as required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**
