Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it is not calculating the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program is simply sorting the array and printing it, but it is not calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, if the input is [2, 1, 3], the program will output [1, 2, 3], but it will not calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is (3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2.

To fix this, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, like this:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

This corrected program will output the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
