Reasoning:
The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the input array in ascending order and then prints the sorted array. This does not calculate the beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the difference between each element and its previous element to a running total.

Correctness: **False**
