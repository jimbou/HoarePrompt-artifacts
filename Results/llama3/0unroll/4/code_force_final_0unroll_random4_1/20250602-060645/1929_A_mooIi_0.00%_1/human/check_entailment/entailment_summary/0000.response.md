Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply sorts the input integers in ascending order and prints them. The problem requires the program to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is not done in the provided program.

Correctness: **False**
