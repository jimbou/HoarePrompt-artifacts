Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. However, the program is not correctly solving the problem.

The program is sorting the input array in ascending order and then printing the sorted array. However, the problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This can be done by iterating through the sorted array and adding the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to a running total.

However, the given program is not doing this. It is simply printing the sorted array, which is not the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.

Correctness: **False**
