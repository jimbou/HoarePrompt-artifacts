Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly handles the following cases:

- If both a and b are odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
- If a is twice b or b is twice a, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
- In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because another rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly iterates over the test cases, reads the input values of a and b, and prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
