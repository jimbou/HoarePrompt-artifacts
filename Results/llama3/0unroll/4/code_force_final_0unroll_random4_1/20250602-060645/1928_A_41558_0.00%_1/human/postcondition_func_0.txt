This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the size of a rectangle. It then determines whether it is possible to divide the rectangle into two equal parts by cutting it along a line that passes through the center of the rectangle, and prints 'YES' if possible, or 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to the console, leaving the input unchanged.
