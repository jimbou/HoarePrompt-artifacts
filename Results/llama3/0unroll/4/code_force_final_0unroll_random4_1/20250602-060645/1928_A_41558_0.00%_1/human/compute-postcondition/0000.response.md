Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 10^9 from the input, which is the size of Bob's rectangle. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
