Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal parts by checking if both dimensions are odd or if one dimension is twice the other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example cases.

Correctness: **True**
