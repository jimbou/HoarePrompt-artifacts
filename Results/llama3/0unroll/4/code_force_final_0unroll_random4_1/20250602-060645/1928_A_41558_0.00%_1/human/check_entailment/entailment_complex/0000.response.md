Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two equal parts.

The program first checks if both a and b are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to form another rectangle in this case.

Then, it checks if a is twice b or b is twice a. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO' because in these cases, the two resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle.

In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two equal parts.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
