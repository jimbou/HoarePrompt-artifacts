Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b) and checks the following conditions:

1. If both a and b are odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.
2. If a is twice b or b is twice a, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotated and moved to form another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly handles the cases where the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides (condition 1) and where the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle (condition 2). For all other cases, it correctly prints 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
