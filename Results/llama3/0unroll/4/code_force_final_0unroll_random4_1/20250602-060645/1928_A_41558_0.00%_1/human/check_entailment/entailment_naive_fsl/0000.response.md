Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The logic is as follows:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
- If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
- In all other cases, it's possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal, or where one is twice the other. The program's logic is sound and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
