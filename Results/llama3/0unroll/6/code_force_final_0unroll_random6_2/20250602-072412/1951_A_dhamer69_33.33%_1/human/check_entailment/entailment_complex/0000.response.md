Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the base case where `n == 2`. In this case, the only valid configuration is '00', because there are no non-adjacent lamps to turn on. The program correctly prints 'YES' for this case and 'NO' for any other configuration.

2. For `n > 2`, the program correctly checks if the number of '1's in the configuration is even. If it's not, the program prints 'NO', because it's impossible to turn on an odd number of lamps by choosing two non-adjacent lamps at a time.

3. The program also correctly checks if there are any adjacent '1's in the configuration. If there are, the program prints 'NO', because it's impossible to turn on two adjacent lamps by choosing two non-adjacent lamps.

4. If the configuration passes both checks, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the configuration can be achieved.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
