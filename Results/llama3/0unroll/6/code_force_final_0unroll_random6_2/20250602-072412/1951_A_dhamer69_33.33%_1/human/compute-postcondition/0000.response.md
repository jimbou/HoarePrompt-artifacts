The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, which are the second lines of each test case, containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a binary string `s` of size `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of a line with an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a binary string `s` of size `n`.**
