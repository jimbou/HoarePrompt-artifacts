Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the base case where n = 2, and for n > 2, it checks if the number of '1's in the string is even and if there are no consecutive '1's. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that we can turn on two non-adjacent lamps at a time. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
