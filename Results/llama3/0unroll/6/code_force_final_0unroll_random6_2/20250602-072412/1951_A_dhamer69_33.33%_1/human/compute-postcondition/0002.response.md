Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of lamps and a binary string representing the desired configuration. It then determines whether the desired configuration can be achieved and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it concludes, leaving the output as a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses.**
