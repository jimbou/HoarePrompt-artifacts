Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string `s` contains two consecutive '1's that are not at the beginning or end of the string. For example, if `n = 4` and `s = '1011'`, the program will print 'NO' because `s.count('11') == 1`, but it is actually possible to reach this configuration by turning on the first and third lamps, and then turning on the second and fourth lamps.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if there is exactly one pair of consecutive '1's, but it does not consider the case where there are multiple pairs of consecutive '1's that are not adjacent to each other. To fix this, the program should check if there are any pairs of consecutive '1's that are not adjacent to each other, and if so, print 'NO'. Otherwise, it should print 'YES'.
