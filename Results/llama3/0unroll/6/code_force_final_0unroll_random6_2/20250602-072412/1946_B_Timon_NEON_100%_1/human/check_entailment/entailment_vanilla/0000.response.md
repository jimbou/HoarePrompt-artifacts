Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The answer should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

The provided program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. However, func_3 is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.

Func_1 simply returns the input number modulo 1000000007, which is correct for the problem's requirement.

Func_2 attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array. It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum of positive numbers and a maximum sum of positive numbers. However, it does not correctly handle negative numbers and does not consider the k operations.

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly implement the logic for the k operations. It does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of a subarray at any position in the array, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.

Therefore, based on the provided program, it is not possible to determine the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **False**
