Functionality: This function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list and the ending index of that segment. The function identifies all segments of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list, calculates their sums, and keeps track of the maximum sum found. If multiple segments have the same maximum sum, the function returns the one with the highest ending index. If no such segments exist, the function returns a default value.
