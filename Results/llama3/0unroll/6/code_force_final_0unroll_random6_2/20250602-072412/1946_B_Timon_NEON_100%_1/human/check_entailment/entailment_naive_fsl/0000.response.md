Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. However, the provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers. The program's function `func_2` tries to find the maximum segment of positive numbers, but it does not handle the case where the maximum segment is actually a segment of negative numbers that can be inserted to increase the sum of the array.

For example, consider the input array `[-4, -7]` and `k = 2`. The program's function `func_2` will not find the maximum segment correctly, and the program will not produce the correct output.

Additionally, the program's function `func_3` is incomplete and does not implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
