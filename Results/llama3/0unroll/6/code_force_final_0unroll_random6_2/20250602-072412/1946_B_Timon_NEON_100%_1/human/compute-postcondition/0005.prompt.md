Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the sum of all elements in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr and the ending index of that segment, max_sum is the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1, and segments_variants has two additional sublists: one is a copy of max_segment with the last element of arr appended, and the other is a copy of new_segment with the last element of arr appended.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
