Functionality: This function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list and the ending index of that segment. The function identifies segments of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list, calculates their sums, and keeps track of the maximum sum and its corresponding ending index. If no such segment exists, the function returns a default value. The function does not modify the input list.
