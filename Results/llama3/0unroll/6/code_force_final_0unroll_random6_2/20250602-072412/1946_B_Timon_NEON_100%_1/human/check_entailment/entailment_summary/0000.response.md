Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Function func_1 takes an integer as input and returns its remainder when divided by 1000000007. This function is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required range.

Function func_2 accepts a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list and the ending index of that segment. This function is used to identify the maximum sum of a segment that can be inserted into the array.

The main program reads the input, calls func_2 to find the maximum segment, and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations using the formula: max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]. Finally, it calls func_1 to ensure the answer is within the required range and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It identifies the maximum sum of a segment that can be inserted into the array, calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations, and ensures the answer is within the required range.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
