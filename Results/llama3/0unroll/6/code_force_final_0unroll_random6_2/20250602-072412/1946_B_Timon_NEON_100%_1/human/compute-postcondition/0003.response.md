Output State: **new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the sum of all elements in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr and the ending index of that segment, max_sum is the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1, and segments_variants has two additional sublists: one is a copy of max_segment with the last element of arr appended, and the other is a copy of new_segment with the last element of arr appended.**

In this output state, the values of new_segment, max_segment, segments_variants, and max_sum remain unchanged from the initial state. The code adds two new sublists to segments_variants: one is a copy of max_segment with the last element of arr appended, and the other is a copy of new_segment with the last element of arr appended. Additionally, a new variable total_max_segment is introduced with a value of [-1].
