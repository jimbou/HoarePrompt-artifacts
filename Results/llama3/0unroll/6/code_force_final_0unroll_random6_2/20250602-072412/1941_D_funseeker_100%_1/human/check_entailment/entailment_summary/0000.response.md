Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the information about the throws, and calculates the possible positions of the ball after the game was interrupted.

The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball, which is efficient because it automatically eliminates duplicates. It also correctly handles the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

The program also correctly handles the case where the possible position is 0 by replacing it with n, which is the correct position in the circular arrangement of players.

The output of the program is also correct, as it prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of possible positions.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
