Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using Function 2 (`func_2()`).

2. For each test case, the program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` using Function 3 (`func_3()`).

3. The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This set will store the possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

4. The program then iterates over each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` using Function 1 (`func_1()`).

5. If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', the program calculates the next possible player by adding the distance `r` to the current player `q` and taking the modulus `n` to ensure the player is within the circle. If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', the program calculates the next possible player by subtracting the distance `r` from the current player `q` and taking the modulus `n`.

6. The program updates the set `ans` with the new possible players after each throw.

7. After all throws, the program checks if the set `ans` contains 0, which is not a valid player. If it does, the program discards 0 and adds `n` to the set, since the players are numbered from 1 to `n`.

8. Finally, the program prints the number of possible players in `ans` and the players themselves in sorted order.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
