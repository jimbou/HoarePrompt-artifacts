The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of elements in the set `ans`. The set `ans` contains all possible values of `x` after `m` iterations of the loop. Since `m` is 0, the loop has not executed any iterations, and the set `ans` only contains the initial value of `x`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n. Therefore, the length of the set `ans` is 1.

Output: **1**
