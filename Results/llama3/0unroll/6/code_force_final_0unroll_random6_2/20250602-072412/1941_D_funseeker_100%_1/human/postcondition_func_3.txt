This function calculates and returns the number of possible values of x after m iterations of a loop, where x is a positive integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and m is a non-negative integer. The function also prints the sorted list of possible values of x. If 0 is a possible value, it is replaced with n. The function assumes that the input values n, m, and x are obtained from another function func_3(), and that func_1() is used to generate random values for the loop iterations.
