Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing the value of x**

The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n`, `m`, and `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function. The second line creates a set `ans` containing the value of `x`. The value of `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, so the set `ans` contains a single positive integer value. No other variables are affected.
