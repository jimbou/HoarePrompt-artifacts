Output: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If 0 is in ans, then ans includes n but does not include 0, and the number of possible values of x after m iterations of the loop which is the length of ans is being printed, and the sorted list of all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop which is the sorted list of elements in ans is being printed**
