Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is an integer such that 0 <= `xor` < 2^30, `thing1` is the maximum value in `new_arr` at index `bit - 1`, and the `bit-th` bit of `xor` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `new_arr` at index `bit - 1`, which is determined by the function `find_max`. The other variables, `new_arr` and `xor`, remain unchanged, and the condition that the `bit-th` bit of `xor` is 0 is still valid.
