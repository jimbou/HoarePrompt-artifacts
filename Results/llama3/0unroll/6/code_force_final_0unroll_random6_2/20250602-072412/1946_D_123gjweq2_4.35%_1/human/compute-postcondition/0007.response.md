Output State: **new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is an integer such that 0 <= xor < 2^30, thing1 is -1, and the current value of xor has a 1 in the bit position specified by bit.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been updated to `-1`, while the values of `new_arr` and `xor` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `xor` has a 1 in the bit position specified by `bit` is still valid.
