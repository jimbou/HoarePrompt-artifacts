Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value in new_arr at index bit - 1 (if the bit-th bit of xor is 0) or -1 (if the bit-th bit of xor is 1), and the length of new_arr.**

In this output state, the maximum value in new_arr at index bit - 1 is determined by the value of xor. If the bit-th bit of xor is 0, the maximum value in new_arr at index bit - 1 is returned. If the bit-th bit of xor is 1, -1 is returned. The length of new_arr is also returned as part of the maximum value.
