Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The given program sorts the list of book pages in descending order and then prints the sum of the two largest integers, which corresponds to the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly implements the required logic:

1.  It reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2.  For each test case, it reads a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book.
3.  It sorts the list in descending order using the `sort(reverse=True)` method.
4.  It prints the sum of the two largest integers in the sorted list, which are `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the sum of the two largest integers in each list.

Correctness: **True**
