The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n`, which is read by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of one line containing `t` integers**.

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` now holds an integer value between 2 and 100, which represents the number of integers in the next line of the input. The standard input still contains multiple test cases, but the first line of each test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining input consists of lines containing `t` integers each.
