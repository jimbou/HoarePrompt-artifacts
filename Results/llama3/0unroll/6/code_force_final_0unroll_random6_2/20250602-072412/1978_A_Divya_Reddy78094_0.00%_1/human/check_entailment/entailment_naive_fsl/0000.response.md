Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading one book with the highest number in each pile. The program sorts the books in descending order and then prints the sum of the pages of the first two books, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it always chooses the two books with the highest number of pages, which is the optimal solution. The program also handles the case where there are only two books, in which case it simply prints the sum of the pages of the two books.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
