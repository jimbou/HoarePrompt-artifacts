Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of cells `n`, and the sequence of integers `a` for each test case.

2. The program correctly removes leading and trailing zeros from the sequence `a` using the `while` loops. This is necessary because the problem statement requires the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them, and leading/trailing zeros do not affect this requirement.

3. The program correctly counts the number of zeros in the middle of the sequence `a` (excluding leading and trailing zeros) using the `for` loop. This is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

4. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
