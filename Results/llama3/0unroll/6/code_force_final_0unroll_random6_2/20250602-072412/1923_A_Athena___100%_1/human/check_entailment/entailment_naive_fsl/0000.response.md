Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them. It first removes the leading and trailing zeros from the list, and then counts the number of zeros in the remaining list. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program handles all the potential cases correctly, including the cases where the input list contains only ones, only zeros, or a mix of ones and zeros. It also handles the cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
