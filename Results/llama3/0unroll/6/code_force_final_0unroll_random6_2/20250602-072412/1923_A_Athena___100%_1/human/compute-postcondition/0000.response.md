Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2*t lines. The first t lines contain one integer n (2 <= n <= 50). The following t lines contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The remaining lines in the stdin are still valid, with the first `t` lines containing one integer `n` each, and the following `t` lines containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` each.
