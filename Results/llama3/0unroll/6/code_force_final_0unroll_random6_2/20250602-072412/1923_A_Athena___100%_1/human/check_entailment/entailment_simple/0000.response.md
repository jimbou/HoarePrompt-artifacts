Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the sequence of integers `a` representing the presence or absence of chips in each cell.

The program then removes leading and trailing zeros from the sequence `a` using two while loops. This is done to exclude the free cells at the beginning and end of the sequence, as they do not affect the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Next, the program iterates through the modified sequence `a` and counts the number of zeros (representing free cells) in the middle of the sequence. This count is stored in the variable `res`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
