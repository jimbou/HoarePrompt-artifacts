Output State: *n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers, 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a, if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a and sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then ans is the number of sublists of length m in a that have at least k common integers with b. Otherwise, ans remains 0.
