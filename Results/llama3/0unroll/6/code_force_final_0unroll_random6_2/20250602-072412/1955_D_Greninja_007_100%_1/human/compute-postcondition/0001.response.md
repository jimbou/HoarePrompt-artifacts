Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers, 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], ans is 0, sm is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b, and the current value of sm is greater than or equal to k.**
