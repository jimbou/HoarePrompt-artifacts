Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers, 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m]`, `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m]` and sorted list `b`, and the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, and `sm` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All the conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid, including the range of values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and the relationship between `sm` and `k`.
