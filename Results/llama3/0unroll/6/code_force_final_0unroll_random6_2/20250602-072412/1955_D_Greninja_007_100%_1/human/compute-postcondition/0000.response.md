Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers, 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], ans is 0, sm is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes without modifying the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, which remain integers within the specified range. The lists `a` and `b` also retain their original values and lengths. Two new Counter objects, `cb` and `ca`, are created to store the frequency of each integer in the sorted lists `b` and `a[:m]`, respectively. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the variable `sm` is assigned the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted lists `a[:m]` and `b`.
