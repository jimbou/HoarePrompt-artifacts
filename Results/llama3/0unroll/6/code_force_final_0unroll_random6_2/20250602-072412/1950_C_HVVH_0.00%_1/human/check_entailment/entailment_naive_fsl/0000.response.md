Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 12:00, the program should output 12:00 PM, but it outputs 12:00 AM. This is because the program sets day to 'AM' when h is 0, but it should set day to 'PM' when h is 12.

Additionally, the program sets day to 'PM' when h is greater than 12, but it should only set day to 'PM' when h is greater than 12 and not equal to 12. 

The correct code should be:

```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```
