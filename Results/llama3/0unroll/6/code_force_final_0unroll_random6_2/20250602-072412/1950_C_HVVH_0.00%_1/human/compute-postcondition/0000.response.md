Output State: **day is 'AM', n is a positive integer between 1 and 1440, stdin contains t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm)**

The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable n. Since stdin contains a positive integer t followed by t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format, the value of n will be a positive integer between 1 and 1440. After the execution of the code, the value of day remains 'AM', and the value of n is set to a positive integer between 1 and 1440. The stdin still contains t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
