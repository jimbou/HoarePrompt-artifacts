Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, and then calculates the bets for each outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.

2. Then, for each outcome, the program calculates the bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.

3. The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the bets. This is done by defining a function `func_1` that calculates the HCF of a list of numbers.

4. The program then divides each bet by the HCF to minimize the bets while still satisfying the condition that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

5. Finally, the program checks if the sum of the minimized bets is greater than or equal to the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the minimized bets.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
