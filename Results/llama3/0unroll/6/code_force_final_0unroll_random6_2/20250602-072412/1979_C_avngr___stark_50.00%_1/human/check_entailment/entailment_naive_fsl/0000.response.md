Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, then the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, and the case where the multipliers are all different. It also correctly handles the case where the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM, in which case it prints -1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
