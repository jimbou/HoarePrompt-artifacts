Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to determine how to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers k_i, which is stored in the variable m. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet, which is the LCM divided by the multiplier k_i. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized.

The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts of coins to bet, which is stored in the variable hcf. This is done to reduce the amounts of coins to bet while still ensuring that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized.

Finally, the program checks if the sum of the reduced amounts of coins to bet is greater than or equal to the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the reduced amounts of coins to bet for each outcome.

The program uses a helper function func_1 to calculate the HCF of a list of numbers. This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the HCF.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. The program correctly calculates the LCM and HCF of the multipliers and the amounts of coins to bet, and it correctly checks if the sum of the reduced amounts of coins to bet is greater than or equal to the LCM divided by the HCF.

Correctness: **True**
