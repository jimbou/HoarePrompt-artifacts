Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.

To minimize the total amount of coins bet, the program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the amounts calculated in the previous step and divides each amount by the HCF. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is minimized while still satisfying the condition that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
