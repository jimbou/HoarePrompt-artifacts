#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list of integers, `hcf` is an integer equal to the highest common factor of all the elements in `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the highest common factor of all the integers in the list `numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the highest common factor (HCF) of a list of integers. It takes a list of integers as input, iterates through the list to find the HCF, and returns the result. The input list remains unchanged. The function's purpose is to determine the greatest common divisor of all integers in the provided list.
