Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the highest common factor (HCF) of a list of integers. This function is used to find the HCF of the bets for each outcome, which is then used to adjust the bets to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program's logic is correct. It first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is the minimum amount that needs to be bet to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for each outcome. The HCF of these bets is calculated and used to adjust the bets to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
