Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing a single element -1, ans is a list of length n containing all elements as -1.**

In this output state, the initial state of `a` and `n` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. The `left` variable is assigned a list containing a single element, 0. The `last` variable is assigned a list containing a single element, -1. The `ans` variable is assigned a list of length `n` (which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a)) containing all elements as -1.
