This function takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` as input, where `x` is an element in `a`. It returns the index of `x` in `a` plus 1 if `x` is not less than 0 and the index returned by the function `bl(a, x)` points to `x` in `a`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1. If the index returned by `bl(a, x)` does not point to `x` in `a`, it returns that index.
