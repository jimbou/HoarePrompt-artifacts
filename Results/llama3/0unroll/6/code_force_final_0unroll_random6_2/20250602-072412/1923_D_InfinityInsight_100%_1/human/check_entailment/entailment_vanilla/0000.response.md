Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime in a line of slimes. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` is a helper function that uses binary search to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. It first creates a list `left` that stores the cumulative sum of the slime sizes from left to right. It also creates a list `last` that stores the index of the last slime that is different from the current slime.

The function then iterates over the list of slime sizes. For each slime, it checks if the current slime is smaller than the previous slime. If it is, the slime can be eaten by the previous slime in 1 second, so it sets the answer for the current slime to 1.

If the current slime is not smaller than the previous slime, the function calculates the cumulative sum of the slime sizes up to the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus 1. It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime that is greater than or equal to this cumulative sum. If this index is less than the index of the last slime that is different from the current slime, it updates the index.

If the index is less than 0, it means that there is no slime that can eat the current slime, so it skips to the next slime. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten by subtracting the index from the current index plus 1.

Finally, the function returns the list of answers for each slime.

Correctness: **True**
