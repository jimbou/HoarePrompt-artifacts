#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers and x is an integer such that x is in a. The function bl(a, x) is defined and returns an index in a.

    #The program returns the index of an integer `x` in list `a` that is not equal to `x`, where `x` is not less than 0 and is an element in list `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` as input, where `x` is an element in `a`. It returns the index of `x` in `a` plus 1 if `x` is not less than 0 and the index returned by the function `bl(a, x)` points to `x` in `a`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1. If the index returned by `bl(a, x)` does not point to `x` in `a`, it returns that index.

    #The program returns the list 'ans' which contains the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index, with each element being the maximum length of the subsequence up to that index.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index in a given list of non-negative integers. It takes a list 'a' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is the number of elements to consider in the list. The function returns a list 'ans' where each element at index 'i' represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index 'i'. If no such subsequence exists, the corresponding element in 'ans' will be -1. The function considers all potential cases, including when the input list is empty or contains duplicate elements.
