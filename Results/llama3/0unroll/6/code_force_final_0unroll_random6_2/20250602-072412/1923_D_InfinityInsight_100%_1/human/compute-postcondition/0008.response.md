Functionality: **This function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index in a given list of non-negative integers. It takes a list 'a' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is the number of elements to consider in the list. The function returns a list 'ans' where each element at index 'i' represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index 'i'. If no such subsequence exists, the corresponding element in 'ans' will be -1. The function considers all potential cases, including when the input list is empty or contains duplicate elements.**
