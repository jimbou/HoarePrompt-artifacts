Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
3 2 4 2

The program outputs:

2 1 2 1

However, the correct output should be:

2 1 -1 1

The program incorrectly assumes that the slime at index 2 can be eaten by the slime at index 1, when in fact it cannot. This is because the slime at index 1 is not larger than the slime at index 2.

The program also does not handle the case where a slime is not eaten by any other slime. In this case, the program should output -1, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
