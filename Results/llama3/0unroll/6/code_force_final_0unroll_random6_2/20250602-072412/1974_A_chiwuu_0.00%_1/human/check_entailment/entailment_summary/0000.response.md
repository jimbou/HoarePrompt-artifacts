Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The program takes the number of applications with 1x1 icons (x) and 2x2 icons (y) as input and calculates the minimum number of screens required.

The program first calculates the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons (t). If the total number of cells required for the 2x2 icons (t * 2) is a multiple of 5, it calculates the number of screens as t = t // 5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of screens as t = t // 5 + 1.

Next, the program calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (t1 = t * 15 - b * 4). If the remaining space is sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (t1 >= a), it keeps the current value of t. Otherwise, it calculates the additional space needed for the 1x1 icons (t2 = a - t1) and adds the required number of screens to t.

The program then prints the calculated value of t for each input pair (x, y).

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required for each input pair. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
