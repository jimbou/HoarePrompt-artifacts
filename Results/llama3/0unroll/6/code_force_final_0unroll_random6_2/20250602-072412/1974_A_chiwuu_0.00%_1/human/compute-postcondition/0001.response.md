Output State: The output state will be a list of `n` integers, each representing the calculated value of `t` for the corresponding input pair `(a, b)`. The value of `t` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop body, which involve arithmetic operations and conditional statements. The output state will not change the values of `n`, `x`, or `y`, as they are not modified within the loop.
