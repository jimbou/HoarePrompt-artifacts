This function reads a series of input pairs (x, y) from standard input, calculates a value t based on the given formula, and prints the calculated value of t for each pair. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no value, instead, it prints the calculated values to the standard output. The output is a list of integers, each representing the calculated value of t for the corresponding input pair (x, y).
