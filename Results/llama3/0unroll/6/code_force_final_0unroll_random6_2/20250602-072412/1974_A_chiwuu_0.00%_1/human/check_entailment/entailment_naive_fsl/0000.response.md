Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells), dividing by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows), and rounding up to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a screen).

2. It then calculates the number of cells remaining on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and subtracting the number of cells taken up by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons).

3. If the number of remaining cells is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons, then the program simply prints the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. This is because the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons.

4. If the number of remaining cells is less than the number of 1x1 icons, then the program calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the 1x1 icons. This is done by subtracting the number of remaining cells from the number of 1x1 icons, dividing by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and rounding up to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a screen). The program then adds this number to the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons and prints the result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no 2x2 icons, the case where there are no 1x1 icons, and the case where the number of 1x1 icons is greater than the number of remaining cells on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons.
