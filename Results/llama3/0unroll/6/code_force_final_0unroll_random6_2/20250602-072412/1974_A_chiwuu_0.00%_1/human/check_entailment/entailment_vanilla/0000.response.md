Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of screens with a grid size of 5x3, and there are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (n) and then iterates through each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. It calculates the total number of cells required for the 2x2 icons (t = b * 2) and then determines the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate these icons. If the total number of cells is a multiple of 5, it calculates the number of screens as t // 5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of screens as t // 5 + 1.

4. It then calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (t1 = t * 15 - b * 4).

5. If the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (t1 >= a), it keeps the current number of screens (t). Otherwise, it calculates the additional number of screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons (t2 = a - t1) and adds it to the current number of screens.

6. Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **True**
