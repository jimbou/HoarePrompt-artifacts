Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by the code and remain as specified in the initial state.
