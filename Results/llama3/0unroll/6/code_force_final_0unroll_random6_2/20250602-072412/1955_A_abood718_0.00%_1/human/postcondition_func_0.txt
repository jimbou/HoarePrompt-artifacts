This function reads input from stdin, processes t sets of three integers (A, B, C), and prints the results of different calculations based on the values of A, B, and C. For each set, if B * 2 is less than C, it prints A * B. If A is even, it prints A * C / 2. If A is odd, it prints A // 2 on the first line and (A // 2) * C + B on the second line. The function generates t lines of output, with some lines containing one integer and others containing two integers.
