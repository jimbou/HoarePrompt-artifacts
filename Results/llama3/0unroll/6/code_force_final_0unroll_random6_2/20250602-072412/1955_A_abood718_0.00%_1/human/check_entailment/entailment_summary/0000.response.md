Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (C). If it is, it prints the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, it checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, it prints the cost of buying A yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (A // 2), and then prints the cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price plus the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price ((A // 2) * C + B).

However, there is a mistake in the program. When the number of yogurts is odd, it prints the number of pairs of yogurts (A // 2) on the first line, which is incorrect. It should only print the total cost on one line.

Correctness: **False**
