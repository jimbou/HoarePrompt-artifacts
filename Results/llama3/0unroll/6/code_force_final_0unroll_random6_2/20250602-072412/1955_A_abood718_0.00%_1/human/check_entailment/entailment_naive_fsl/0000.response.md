Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts. In the case where A is odd and B * 2 >= C, the program prints the number of pairs of yogurts (X) and then prints X * C + B, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be X * C + B * (A % 2), because the remaining yogurt (A % 2) should be bought at the regular price B, not at the promotion price C.

For example, if A = 3, B = 5, and C = 11, the program will print 1 and then 1 * 11 + 5, which is 16, but the correct answer is 15 (2 yogurts at the promotion price 11 and 1 yogurt at the regular price 5).
