Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line.

The program iterates through the lists 'a' and 'b' in reverse order, maintaining a cumulative sum 'x' of the minimum of 'a[i]' and 'b[i]'. When 'i' is less than 'm', it updates 'pergunta' with the minimum value between its current value and the sum of 'x' and 'a[i]'. This is because Kirill can choose to bribe the person at position 'i' and pay 'a[i]' coins, and then pay 'x' coins to the people between 'i' and 'm'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when 'm' is 1 or when 'n' is equal to 'm'. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

Correctness: **True**
