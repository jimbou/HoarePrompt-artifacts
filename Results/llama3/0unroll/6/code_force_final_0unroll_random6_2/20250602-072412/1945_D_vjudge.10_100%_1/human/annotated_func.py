#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is the sum of the minimum of a_i and b_i for all i from 0 to n-1.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: [pergunta] (where pergunta is the value of the variable pergunta)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum value of a given variable 'pergunta' by iterating through two lists 'a' and 'b' of length 'n' in reverse order, updating 'pergunta' with the minimum value between its current value and the sum of 'x' (the cumulative sum of the minimum of 'a[i]' and 'b[i]') and 'a[i]' when 'i' is less than 'm'. The function then prints the updated value of 'pergunta'.
