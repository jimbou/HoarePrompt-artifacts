Output State: **pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is 0**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `x` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`, remain unchanged. The length of lists `a` and `b` is still `n`, and the constraints on the values of `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are still valid.
