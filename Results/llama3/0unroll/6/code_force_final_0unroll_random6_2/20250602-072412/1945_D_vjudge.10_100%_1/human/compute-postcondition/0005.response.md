Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum value of a given variable 'pergunta' by iterating through two lists 'a' and 'b' of length 'n' in reverse order, updating 'pergunta' with the minimum value between its current value and the sum of 'x' (the cumulative sum of the minimum of 'a[i]' and 'b[i]') and 'a[i]' when 'i' is less than 'm'. The function then prints the updated value of 'pergunta'.**
