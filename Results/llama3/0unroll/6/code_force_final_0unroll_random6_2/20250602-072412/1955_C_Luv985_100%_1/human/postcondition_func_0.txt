This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of pairs of integers that can be made equal by subtracting a certain value from each pair, given a list of integers and a target value k. The function iterates through the list, comparing pairs of integers from the start and end, subtracting the minimum value from each pair, and updating the target value k. It counts the number of pairs that can be made equal and prints the result.
