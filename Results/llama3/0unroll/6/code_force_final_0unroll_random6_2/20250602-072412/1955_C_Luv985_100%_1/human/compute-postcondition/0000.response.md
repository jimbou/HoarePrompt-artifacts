Output State: **T is a positive integer, stdin contains T - 1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, and then a list of n space-separated integers. n and k are positive integers, k is less than or equal to 10^15, n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The list of integers contains positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.**

Explanation: The code reads the first input from stdin, which is the number of test cases T. After this line executes, T - 1 test cases remain in stdin. The value of T is assigned to the variable T. No other variables are affected.
