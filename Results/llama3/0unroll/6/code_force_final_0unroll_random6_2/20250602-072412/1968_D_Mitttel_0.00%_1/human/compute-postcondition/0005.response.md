Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of space-separated integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t). For each test case, it reads in additional integers representing the size of an array (n), a value k, and two more integers PB and PS. It then reads in two arrays of integers, p and a, each of size n. The function calls another function, func_1, with these inputs and appends the result to a list of results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the results list.**
