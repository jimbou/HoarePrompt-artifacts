Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on their scores, which are calculated by traversing a permutation list 'p' and accumulating values from list 'a' for 'k' steps. The program handles cycles in the permutation by adding the score of full cycles and remaining steps.

Function `func_1` determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', which are calculated using the `calculate_score` function. Function `calculate_score` calculates the score by traversing the permutation list 'p' and accumulating values from list 'a' for 'k' steps, handling cycles in the permutation. Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the scores and determine the winner of the game. It handles cycles in the permutation and accumulates the scores correctly. The input is read and processed correctly, and the results are printed as expected.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
