Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The score is increased by the product of the number of full cycles and the cycle score, current_pos remains the kth element of p, steps remains k, visited remains a dictionary containing the first k elements of p as keys and their corresponding indices as values, cycle_start remains unchanged, start_pos remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, p remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, cycle_length is 0, cycle_score is the sum of the elements of a in the cycle, and cycle_pos is the element of p that is the last element of the cycle.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
