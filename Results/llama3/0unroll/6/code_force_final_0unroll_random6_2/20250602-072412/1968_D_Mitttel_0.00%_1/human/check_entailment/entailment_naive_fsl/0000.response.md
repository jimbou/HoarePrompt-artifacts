Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation and adding the corresponding values from the array `a`. The program also correctly handles the case where the game lasts for `k` turns and the players move according to the permutation.

The `calculate_score` function is the core of the program, and it correctly implements the logic to calculate the score for a given starting position. It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions that have been visited and to detect cycles in the permutation. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and adds it to the total score.

The `func_1` function correctly calls the `calculate_score` function for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The `func_2` function reads the input data and calls the `func_1` function for each test case. It correctly handles the input data and prints the results for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description, and it handles all the potential cases correctly.
