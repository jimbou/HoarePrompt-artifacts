Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is a space-separated list of integers, index is 1, t is an integer equal to the first integer in the first string of data, results is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

Explanation:

The code reads the entire contents of stdin into the variable `data`, splitting it into a list of strings separated by spaces. Since `data` was initially a list of strings where each string is a space-separated list of integers, this operation does not change the structure of `data`, but it does change its contents to reflect the input from stdin.

The `index` variable is set to 0, and then incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.

The `t` variable is assigned the value of the first integer in the first string of `data`, which is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

The `results` variable is initialized as an empty list.

Since the entire contents of stdin are read into `data`, stdin becomes empty after the execution of the code.
