Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`.

`func_1` is the main function that takes the input parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calls the `calculate_score` function to calculate the scores for both Bodya and Sasha. It then compares the scores and returns the result.

`calculate_score` is a function that calculates the score for a given starting position. It uses a while loop to iterate through the permutation and calculate the score. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and adds it to the total score.

`func_2` is a function that reads the input from the standard input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha and returns the result based on the comparison of the scores.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `calculate_score` function uses a global variable `a` which is not defined in the function. The `a` variable is defined in the `func_2` function and is not accessible in the `calculate_score` function. To fix this issue, the `a` variable should be passed as a parameter to the `calculate_score` function.

Correctness: **False**
