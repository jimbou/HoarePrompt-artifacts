Output State: The loop has executed t iterations, and the results list now contains t elements, each representing the result of the func_1 function call for the corresponding iteration. The index variable has been incremented by 4 + 2n for each iteration, where n is the value of the variable n in each iteration. The data list remains unchanged, as does the stdin variable.
