Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a sequence of lines, each containing three digits (between 0 and 9).
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The output will be a sequence of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the values of a, b, and c in each iteration. The number of lines will be equal to the value of q. The value of q will be unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer q from standard input, followed by q sequences of three digits each. It then classifies each sequence as 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of the digits and prints the classification for each sequence. The function does not modify the input values and produces q lines of output.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
