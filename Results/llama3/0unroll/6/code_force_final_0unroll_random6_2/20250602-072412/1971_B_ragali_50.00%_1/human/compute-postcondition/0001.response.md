Output State: **The output state is a series of strings, each of which is either the original string, its reverse, or a rotation of the original string by half its length, depending on whether the string has more than one unique character and whether it is a palindrome or not. If a string has only one unique character, the output is 'NO'. The number of strings in the output state is equal to the value of `t`.**
