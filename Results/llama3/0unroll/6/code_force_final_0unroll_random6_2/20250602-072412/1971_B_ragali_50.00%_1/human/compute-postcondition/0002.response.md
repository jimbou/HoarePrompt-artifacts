Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings. For each string, it checks if the string has more than one unique character. If it does, the function prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string: either the string rotated by half its length, its reverse, or the original string if it's a palindrome. If the string has only one unique character, the function prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process t times, resulting in a series of strings as output, where each string is either the original, its reverse, or a rotation of the original, or 'NO' if the string has only one unique character.**
