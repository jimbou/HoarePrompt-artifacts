Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts a series of lines as input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. The function then generates a binary representation of k, with the least significant bit on the left and the most significant bit on the right, and fills the remaining bits with zeros if n is greater than the number of bits in k. Finally, it prints the resulting binary representation as a series of space-separated integers, with each line representing a test case.**
