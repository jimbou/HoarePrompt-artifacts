Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, where n is the number of non-negative integers to be printed and k is the sum of these integers.

3. It then initializes an empty list arr to store the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of k.

4. The program uses a while loop to iterate over the binary representation of k from right to left (i.e., from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). If a bit is 1, it appends the position of the bit to the list arr.

5. After that, it initializes an empty list ans to store the sequence of integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

6. The program then iterates over the list arr. For each position i in arr, it appends 2^i to the list ans. This is because 2^i has a 1 at the i-th position in its binary representation and 0s elsewhere, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

7. If the length of ans is less than n-1, it appends k0 - sum(ans) to ans, where k0 is the original value of k. This ensures that the sum of the integers in ans is equal to k.

8. Finally, the program appends 0s to ans until its length is equal to n. This is because the problem statement allows the sequence to contain zeros.

9. The program then prints the sequence ans.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
