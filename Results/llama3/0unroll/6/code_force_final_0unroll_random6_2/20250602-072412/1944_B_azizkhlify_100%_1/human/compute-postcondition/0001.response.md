Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function rearranges the integers in each test case such that the first k pairs of identical numbers are placed at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the remaining numbers in their original order. If k is greater than the number of pairs of identical numbers, the remaining numbers are placed at the end of the sequence in their original order. The function prints the rearranged sequence for each test case.**
