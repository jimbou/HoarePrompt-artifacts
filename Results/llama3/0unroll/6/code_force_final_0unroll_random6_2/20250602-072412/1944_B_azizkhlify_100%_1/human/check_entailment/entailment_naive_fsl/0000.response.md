Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

4
2 1
1 2 2 1

The program outputs:

2 1
2 1

However, the problem description requires that the two arrays l and r should be subsets of [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}] respectively. In this case, the program outputs the same array for both l and r, which is not a valid solution according to the problem description.

The program also does not handle the case when k is equal to n/2 correctly. In this case, the program should output two arrays of length 2k, but the program only outputs one array of length k.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
