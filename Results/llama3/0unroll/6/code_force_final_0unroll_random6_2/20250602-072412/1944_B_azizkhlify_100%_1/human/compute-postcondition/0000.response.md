Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines, each representing the result of a test case. Each line will contain a sequence of numbers, where each number appears twice, and the sequence is a rearrangement of the input sequence. The rearrangement is done such that the first k pairs of identical numbers are placed at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the remaining numbers in their original order. If k is greater than the number of pairs of identical numbers, the remaining numbers are placed at the end of the sequence in their original order.**
