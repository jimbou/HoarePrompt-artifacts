#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n
        
        r = [0] * n
        
        re = ul = ur = 0
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            r[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                l[a[i] - 1] = 0

            if ul == k * 2:
                break
        
        k = 2 * k - ul
        
        if k:
            for i in range(n):
                if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                    print(a[i], end=' ')

                    break

    #State: The output state will contain multiple lines, each representing the result of a test case. Each line will contain a sequence of numbers, where each number appears twice, and the sequence is a rearrangement of the input sequence. The rearrangement is done such that the first k pairs of identical numbers are placed at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the remaining numbers in their original order. If k is greater than the number of pairs of identical numbers, the remaining numbers are placed at the end of the sequence in their original order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function rearranges the integers in each test case such that the first k pairs of identical numbers are placed at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the remaining numbers in their original order. If k is greater than the number of pairs of identical numbers, the remaining numbers are placed at the end of the sequence in their original order. The function prints the rearranged sequence for each test case.
