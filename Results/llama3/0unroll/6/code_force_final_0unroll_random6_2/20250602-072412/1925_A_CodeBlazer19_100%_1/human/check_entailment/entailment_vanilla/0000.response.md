Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. It then prints the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.

The key insight here is that the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. By repeating this string `n` times, the program is effectively creating a string that contains all possible substrings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The reason this works is that any substring of length `n` can be formed by selecting one character from each of the `n` repetitions of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]`. Since the string is repeated `n` times, every possible combination of characters is present in the resulting string.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
