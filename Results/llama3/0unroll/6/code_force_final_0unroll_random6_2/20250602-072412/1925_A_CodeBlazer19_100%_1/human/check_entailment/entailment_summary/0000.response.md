Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers (`n` and `k`) and uses them to generate the required string.

3. The string is generated by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This is done by slicing the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' up to the `k`-th character and then repeating this slice `n` times.

4. The generated string is then printed for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, consuming all input lines and producing output for each pair of integers read.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
