Functionality: **Replaces a specified sublist in a list of non-negative integers with a repeated value.**

The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the input list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` repeated `l - r + 1` times. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list. The function returns the modified list `lst`.
