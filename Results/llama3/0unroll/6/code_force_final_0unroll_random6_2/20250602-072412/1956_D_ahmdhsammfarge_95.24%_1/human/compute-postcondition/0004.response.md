Output State: **r is an integer, l is an integer, lst is a list of non-negative integers where the sub-list lst[r:l + 1] is replaced with a list of l - r + 1 repeated l - r + 1 times, ops is a list of lists of two integers where two new sub-lists [r + 1, r + 1] and [r + 1, l + 1] are appended.**

The code first appends a new sub-list [r + 1, r + 1] to ops. Then, it calls the function func_2(r, l, ops), but since the function's implementation is not provided, we assume it does not modify the variables r, l, lst, or ops. After the function call, another sub-list [r + 1, l + 1] is appended to ops. The variable n is then assigned the value of l - r + 1. Finally, the sub-list lst[r:l + 1] is replaced with a list of n repeated n times.
