This function generates a list of lists, where each sublist contains two consecutive integers. It takes three parameters: two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can be appended to. The function appends a new sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` if `r` equals `l`. If `r` is less than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends the same sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` twice. The final state of the program is a modified `ops` list with the added sublists.
