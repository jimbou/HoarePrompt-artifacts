Output State: **`r` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of two integers, and `ops` now includes a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The current value of `min(lst[r:l + 1])` is 0, and `ops` has been appended with a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `ops` has been updated to include a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, which is a combination of the current values of `r` and `l`. The condition that the current value of `min(lst[r:l + 1])` is 0 still holds true.
