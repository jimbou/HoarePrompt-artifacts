Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation (replacing a subarray with its MEX) no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly finds the subarray that yields the maximum sum when its elements are summed and the length of the subarray squared is added. It returns the starting and ending indices of this subarray.

3. Function 2 (`func_2`) generates a list of operations to replace a subarray with its MEX. Although its implementation is not optimal (it has exponential time complexity), it is correct in the sense that it produces a valid sequence of operations.

4. Function 3 (`func_3`) replaces a specified subarray in the list with a repeated value (the MEX of the subarray). It also appends the necessary operations to the `ops` list.

5. The main program correctly uses these functions to find the maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. It iteratively finds the subarray that yields the maximum sum, replaces it with its MEX, and updates the `ops` list until no more improvements can be made.

6. The program also handles the case where the input array contains zeros by replacing them with ones and appending the corresponding operations to the `ops` list.

7. Finally, the program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem by finding the maximum sum and constructing a sequence of operations that achieves this sum, all within the allowed number of operations (5 * 10^5).
