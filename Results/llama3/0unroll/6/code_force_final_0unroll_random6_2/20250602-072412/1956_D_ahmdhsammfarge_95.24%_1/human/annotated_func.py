    #The program returns the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds the subarray within a given list of non-negative integers that yields the maximum sum when its elements are summed and the length of the subarray squared is added. It returns the starting and ending indices of this subarray.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that r <= l, and ops is a list that can be appended to.

    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of lists, where each sublist contains two consecutive integers. It takes three parameters: two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can be appended to. The function appends a new sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` if `r` equals `l`. If `r` is less than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends the same sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` twice. The final state of the program is a modified `ops` list with the added sublists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l and lst is a list of non-negative integers and ops is a list of lists of two integers.
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of two integers. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then `ops` is appended with a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers where the sub-list lst[r:l + 1] is replaced with a list of l - r + 1 repeated l - r + 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces a specified sublist in a list of non-negative integers with a repeated value.
