Output State: **`r` is an integer, `l` is an integer, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of two integers, and `ops` now includes a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`**.

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `lst` is still a list of non-negative integers. The list `ops` has been modified to include a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, where `r + 1` and `l + 1` are the incremented values of `r` and `l`, respectively.
