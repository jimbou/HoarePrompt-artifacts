Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, consider the input [0, 0, 0, 0]. The program will return (0, 3) as the optimal range to maximize the sum, but it does not provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The correct sequence of operations would be to first set the entire range to 1, and then set the entire range to 4, but the program does not generate this sequence.

In general, the program does not correctly handle cases where the optimal strategy involves setting a range to a value greater than 1, and then setting a sub-range to an even larger value. The program only considers setting a range to a value of 1, and then setting a sub-range to a value of 2, which is not sufficient to achieve the maximum sum in all cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
