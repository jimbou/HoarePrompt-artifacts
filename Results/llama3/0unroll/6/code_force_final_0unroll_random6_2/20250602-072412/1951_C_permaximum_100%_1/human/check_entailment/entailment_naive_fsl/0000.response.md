Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The issue lies in the way it handles the price increase after purchasing tickets. The program increases the price of all remaining days by the number of tickets purchased, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the price increase should only affect the days after the current day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will purchase 2 tickets on the first day, increasing the price of all remaining days by 2. However, the correct behavior is to increase the price of only the days after the first day (i.e., days 2, 3, and 4) by 2.

To fix this issue, the program needs to keep track of the price increase separately for each day and only apply it to the days after the current day.
