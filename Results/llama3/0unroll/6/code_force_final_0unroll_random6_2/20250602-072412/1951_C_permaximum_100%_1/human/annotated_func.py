#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, prices is a list of n positive integers, and k is less than or equal to n*m.
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: tickets_bought = k, total_cost = sum of prices of k tickets with price increase, price_increase = k, pq is empty
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost of k tickets with a price increase, where the price increase is equal to k.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying k tickets with a price increase, where the price increase is equal to the number of tickets bought. The function takes in a list of ticket prices, the number of tickets to buy (k), and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single transaction (m). It returns the total cost of the tickets with the price increase applied.
