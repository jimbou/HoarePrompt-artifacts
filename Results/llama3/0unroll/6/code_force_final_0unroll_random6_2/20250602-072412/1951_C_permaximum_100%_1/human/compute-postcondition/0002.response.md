Output State: **tickets_bought = k, total_cost = sum of prices of k tickets with price increase, price_increase = k, pq is empty**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of tickets bought (tickets_bought) is equal to k, the total cost is the sum of the prices of k tickets with the price increase, the price increase is equal to k, and the priority queue (pq) is empty.
