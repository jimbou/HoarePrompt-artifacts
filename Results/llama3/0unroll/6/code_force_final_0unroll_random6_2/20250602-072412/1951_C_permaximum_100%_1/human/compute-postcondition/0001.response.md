Output State: tickets_bought = k, total_cost = sum of the prices of the k cheapest tickets, price_increase = k.

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The number of tickets bought (tickets_bought) has reached the desired value k. The total cost (total_cost) is the sum of the prices of the k cheapest tickets, which were purchased in the loop. The price increase (price_increase) has also reached k, indicating that the price of each ticket has increased by k after the loop finishes.
