Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the cheapest ticket prices, and it correctly updates the price increase after each purchase. The program also ensures that it does not buy more tickets than the maximum allowed per day (m) and that it does not buy more tickets than the total number of tickets needed (k).

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. The use of a priority queue is efficient, as it allows the program to quickly find the cheapest ticket prices. The program also handles the price increase correctly, which is a key aspect of the problem.

One potential issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where the number of tickets needed (k) is greater than the total number of tickets available (n*m). However, this is not a problem according to the problem description, which states that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n*m and 10^9.

Correctness: **True**
