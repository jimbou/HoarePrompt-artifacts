Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).

3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list `prices`.

4. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the parameters n, m, k, and prices.

5. Inside the function, it creates a priority queue (pq) using the `heapq` module, where each element is a tuple containing the price and the day index. The priority queue is initialized with the prices and their corresponding day indices.

6. The function then enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets have been bought.

7. Inside the loop, it pops the smallest price from the priority queue, adds the current price increase to it, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day (tickets_to_buy). The number of tickets to buy is the minimum of the maximum allowed tickets per day (m) and the remaining tickets to be bought (k - tickets_bought).

8. It then updates the total cost by adding the product of the price and the number of tickets to buy, increments the tickets_bought counter by the number of tickets to buy, and updates the price increase by the number of tickets to buy.

9. Once all k tickets have been bought, the function returns the total cost.

10. The program prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly implements the greedy strategy to minimize the total cost, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. It uses a priority queue to efficiently select the day with the smallest price, and it updates the prices and the price increase accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
