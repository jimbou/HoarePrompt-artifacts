Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of purchasing no more than m tickets per day and the price increase after each purchase.

The program uses a priority queue (pq) to store the prices of tickets for each day, along with the day number. The pq is initialized with the prices and day numbers, and then heapified to maintain the minimum price at the top.

The program then enters a while loop, which continues until all k tickets have been bought. In each iteration, the program pops the minimum price from the pq, adds the current price increase to it, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day (which is the minimum of m and the remaining tickets to buy).

The program then updates the total cost by adding the product of the price and the number of tickets bought, increments the tickets bought, and updates the price increase by adding the number of tickets bought.

After the loop, the program returns the total cost, which represents the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the constraints of the problem properly. It ensures that the price increase is applied correctly after each purchase and that the total cost is calculated accurately.

Correctness: **True**
