The first line inserts 0 at the beginning of the list nums, effectively adding a new element to the list. The second line assigns the value 0 to the variable cd.

Output State: **The number of test cases is reduced by 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer, nums is a sorted list of distinct integers with 0 added at the beginning, cd is 0**
