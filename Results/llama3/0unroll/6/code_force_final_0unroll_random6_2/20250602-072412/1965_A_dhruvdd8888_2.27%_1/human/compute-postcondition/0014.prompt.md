You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input.
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None
    #State: The number of test cases is reduced by 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer, nums is a sorted list of distinct integers. The length of nums is more than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    #State: *The number of test cases is reduced by 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer, nums is a sorted list of distinct integers. The length of nums is more than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The number of test cases remains the same, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer, nums is a sorted list of distinct integers with 0 added at the beginning, cd is the number of consecutive pairs of integers in nums that differ by 1.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns and prints the string 'Bob'
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_3: The program returns and prints the string 'Bob'

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
