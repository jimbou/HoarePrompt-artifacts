Output State: **The number of test cases is reduced by 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer, nums is a sorted list of distinct integers.**

Explanation:

The first line of the code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This reduces the number of test cases in the input by 1.

The second line reads a set of integers from the input, which are the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n for the current test case. The set data structure automatically removes any duplicate integers.

The third line sorts the set of integers in ascending order, resulting in a sorted list of distinct integers.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the output state is that the number of test cases is reduced by 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, N is an integer representing the number of integers in the current test case, and nums is a sorted list of distinct integers.
