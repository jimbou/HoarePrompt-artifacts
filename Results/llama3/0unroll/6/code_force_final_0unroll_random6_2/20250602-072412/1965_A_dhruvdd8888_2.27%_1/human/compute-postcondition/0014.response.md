Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on a set of distinct integers. The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the winner's name ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each case. The winner is determined by the length of the input set and the presence of consecutive pairs of integers that differ by 1. If the set contains only one or two elements, the function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' respectively. Otherwise, it checks for consecutive pairs and prints 'Bob' if the count is odd, or 'Alice' if the count is even. The function returns None in all cases.**
