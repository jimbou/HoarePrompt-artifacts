Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program first counts the frequency of each stick length and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

The program correctly handles the case where three sticks of the same length are chosen, as well as the case where two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length are chosen. The program also correctly handles the case where all three sticks are of different lengths.

The program uses the formula for combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of n sticks, which is correct. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of sticks of a certain length is less than 3, in which case the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
