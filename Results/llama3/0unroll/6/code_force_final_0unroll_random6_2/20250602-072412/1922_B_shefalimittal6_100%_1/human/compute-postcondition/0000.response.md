Output State: **stdin is empty, data contains all the input data from stdin, idx is 1, t is an integer representing the number of test cases, results is an empty list**

Here's a description of the output state:

The code reads all the input data from stdin and stores it in the `data` list. The `idx` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `data` list, and it is incremented by 1 after reading the first integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `t` variable now holds the value of the first integer in the input data. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list, ready to store the results of the test cases. Stdin is now empty since all the input data has been read and stored in the `data` list.
