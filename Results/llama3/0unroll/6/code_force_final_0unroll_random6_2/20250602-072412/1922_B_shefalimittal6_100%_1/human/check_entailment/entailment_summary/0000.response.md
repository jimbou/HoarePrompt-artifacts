Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of sticks in each test case, and the lengths of the sticks.
2.  It initializes an array `v` to store the frequency of each stick length, which is a good approach to solve this problem.
3.  The program then iterates over the stick lengths and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle. It correctly handles the cases where there are at least 2 sticks of the same length and at least 3 sticks of the same length.
4.  The program uses the formula `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length, which is correct.
5.  The program also uses the formula `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length, which is correct.
6.  The program accumulates the results for each test case and stores them in the `results` list.
7.  Finally, the program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary accurately describes its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
