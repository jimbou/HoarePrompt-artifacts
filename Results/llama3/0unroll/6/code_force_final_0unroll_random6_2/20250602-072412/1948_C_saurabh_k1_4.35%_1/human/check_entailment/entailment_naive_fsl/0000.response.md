Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It only checks the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row, which is not sufficient to determine the reachability of the cell (2, n).

For example, consider the case where n = 4, and the grid is:

>><<
>><>

The program will print 'Yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

A correct solution would need to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by exploring all possible paths.
