Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints output to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and two strings a and b of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. The function then checks the second last character of the second string b and prints 'Yes' if it is '>' and 'No' if it is '<'. The function does not modify the input state and only prints output to the console.**
