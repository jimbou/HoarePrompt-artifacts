Output State: The list 'ans' now contains the cumulative sum of the elements in 'arr' plus one, where each element is at least as large as the corresponding element in 'arr'. The first element of 'ans' is 'arr[0] + 1', and the rest of the elements are the sum of the previous element in 'ans' and the current element in 'arr', or the previous element in 'ans' multiplied by the number of times it needs to be added to itself to be greater than the current element in 'arr'. The value of 'n' remains unchanged.
