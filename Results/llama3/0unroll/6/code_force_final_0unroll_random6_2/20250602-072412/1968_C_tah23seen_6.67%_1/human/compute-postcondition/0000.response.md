Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, ans is a list of n integers where the first element is arr[0] + 1 and the rest are 0.**

The code initializes a new list `ans` with `n` zeros and then assigns the value of `arr[0] + 1` to the first element of `ans`. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain 0. The values of `arr` and `n` are not modified by the code.
