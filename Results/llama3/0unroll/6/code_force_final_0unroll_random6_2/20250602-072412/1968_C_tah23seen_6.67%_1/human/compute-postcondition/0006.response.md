Functionality: This function takes a list of positive integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is the length of 'arr' plus one. It returns a list 'ans' of length 'n', where the first element is 'arr[0] + 1', the last element is the sum of the second last element of 'ans' and the last element of 'arr', and all other elements are the minimum number of operations required to make each element in 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr' using the previous elements in 'ans'. The function modifies the input list 'arr' by adding elements to it, and the final state of the program is the returned list 'ans'.
