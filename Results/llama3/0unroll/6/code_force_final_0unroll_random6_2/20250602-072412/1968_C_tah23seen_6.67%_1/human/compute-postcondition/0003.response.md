Output State: **The list 'ans' now contains the minimum number of operations required to make each element in 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr' using the previous elements in 'ans'. The first element of 'ans' remains 'arr[0] + 1'. The last element of 'ans' is now the sum of the second last element of 'ans' and the last element of 'arr'.**

In this output state, the list 'ans' has been updated such that the last element is now the sum of the second last element of 'ans' and the last element of 'arr'. This means that the last element of 'ans' now represents the minimum number of operations required to make the last element of 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr' using the previous elements in 'ans'. The first element of 'ans' remains unchanged, which is 'arr[0] + 1'. The rest of the elements in 'ans' also remain unchanged.
