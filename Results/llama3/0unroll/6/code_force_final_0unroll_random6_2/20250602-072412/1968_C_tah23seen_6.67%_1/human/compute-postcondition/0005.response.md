Functionality: This function generates a list of minimum operations required to make each element in the input list 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr' using the previous elements in the output list 'ans'. It takes a list of positive integers 'arr' and its length 'n' as input, and returns a list 'ans' where the first element is 'arr[0] + 1', the last element is the sum of the second last element of 'ans' and the last element of 'arr', and all other elements are the minimum number of operations required to make each element in 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr' using the previous elements in 'ans'.
