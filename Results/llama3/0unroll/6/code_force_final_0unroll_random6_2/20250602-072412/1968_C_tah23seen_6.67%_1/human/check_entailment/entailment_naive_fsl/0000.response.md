Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

    3
    1 5

The program will output:

    2 7 5

However, this output does not satisfy the condition that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 5 mod 2 is not equal to 1.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the values of a_i. The line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` is not sufficient to ensure that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}. A correct solution would need to take into account the modular arithmetic and ensure that the values of a_i are chosen such that the condition is satisfied.
