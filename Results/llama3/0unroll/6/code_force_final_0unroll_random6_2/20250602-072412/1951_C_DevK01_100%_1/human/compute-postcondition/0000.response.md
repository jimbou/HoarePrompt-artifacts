The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.**
