Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m) and the price per ticket for each day (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each day (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then calculates the minimum cost to buy k tickets by first sorting the prices per ticket in ascending order. It then determines the number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the daily ticket limit (m). If the number of days is equal to the number of tickets, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices per ticket multiplied by the number of tickets, plus the additional cost due to the daily ticket limit.

If the number of days is not equal to the number of tickets, it calculates the cost by first removing the last day's price from the sorted list and then calculating the cost for the remaining days. It then adds the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day.

The program prints the calculated cost to the console for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
