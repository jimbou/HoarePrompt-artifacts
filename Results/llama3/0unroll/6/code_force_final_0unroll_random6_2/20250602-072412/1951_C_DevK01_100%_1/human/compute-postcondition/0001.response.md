Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will read two lines of input from stdin. The first line will contain three integers n, m, and k, and the second line will contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The loop will calculate the minimum cost to buy k tickets over n days, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (m) and the price per ticket for each day (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The calculated cost will be printed to the console. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will exit.**
