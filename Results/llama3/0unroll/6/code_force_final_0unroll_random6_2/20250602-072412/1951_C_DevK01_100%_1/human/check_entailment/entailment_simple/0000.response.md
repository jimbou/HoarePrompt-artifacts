Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (m) and the price per ticket for each day (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program first reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then calculates the minimum cost to buy k tickets by considering the following cases:

1. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (m) is equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), the program calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets for each day, multiplied by the number of tickets bought each day, plus the additional cost due to the increase in price per ticket for each day.

2. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (m) is not equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), the program calculates the cost as the cost of buying the remaining tickets (k - (n - 1) * m) at the price of the last day, plus the cost of buying the remaining tickets at the prices of the previous days, plus the additional cost due to the increase in price per ticket for each day.

The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles the different cases and calculates the minimum cost to buy k tickets.

Correctness: **True**
