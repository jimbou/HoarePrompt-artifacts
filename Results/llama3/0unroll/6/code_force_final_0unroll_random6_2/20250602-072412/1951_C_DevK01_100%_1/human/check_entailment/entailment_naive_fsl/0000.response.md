Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum amount of tickets that can be purchased each day (m). In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost by assuming that the remaining tickets can be bought at the price of the last day, which is not necessarily true.

For example, if the input is:

4 2 5
8 6 4 2

The program will output 34, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 36.

The correct approach would be to use a priority queue to keep track of the prices of the tickets for each day, and then use a greedy algorithm to buy the tickets with the lowest price first. This way, we can ensure that we are always buying the tickets with the lowest price, which will result in the minimum cost.
