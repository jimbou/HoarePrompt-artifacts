Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering the daily ticket limit m and the price per ticket for each day. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to be bought. The second line contains the prices per ticket for each day.

The program calculates the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets over the given days, considering the daily ticket limit, and prints the calculated cost to the console. The program repeats this process for each test case and then terminates.

The program uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It first sorts the prices per ticket for each day in ascending order. Then, it calculates the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets over the given days, considering the daily ticket limit.

The program handles two cases:

1.  If the total number of tickets to be bought is a multiple of the daily ticket limit, the program calculates the minimum cost by multiplying the daily ticket limit by the sum of the prices per ticket for each day, and adding the cost of the remaining tickets.
2.  If the total number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the daily ticket limit, the program calculates the minimum cost by multiplying the daily ticket limit by the sum of the prices per ticket for each day, adding the cost of the remaining tickets, and adding the cost of the remaining tickets multiplied by the number of days.

The program uses the math.ceil function to calculate the ceiling of the division of the total number of tickets to be bought by the daily ticket limit, which is used to determine the number of days required to buy the specified number of tickets.

The program uses the min function to ensure that the daily ticket limit does not exceed the total number of tickets to be bought.

Overall, the program correctly implements the greedy approach to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
