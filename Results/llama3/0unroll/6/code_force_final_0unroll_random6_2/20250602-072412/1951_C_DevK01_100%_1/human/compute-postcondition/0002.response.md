Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to be bought. The second line contains the prices per ticket for each day. The function calculates the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets over the given days, considering the daily ticket limit, and prints the calculated cost to the console. The function repeats this process for each test case and then terminates.**
