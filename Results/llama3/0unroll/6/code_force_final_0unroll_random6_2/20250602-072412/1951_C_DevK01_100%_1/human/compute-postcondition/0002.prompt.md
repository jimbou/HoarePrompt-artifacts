You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will read two lines of input from stdin. The first line will contain three integers n, m, and k, and the second line will contain n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The loop will calculate the minimum cost to buy k tickets over n days, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (m) and the price per ticket for each day (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The calculated cost will be printed to the console. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will exit.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
