Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the count of "mapie" to avoid double counting. This approach is correct because it considers all possible cases where the string can be made beautiful by removing characters.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:

* When the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "map" or "pie"), it outputs 0.
* When the string contains only "map" or only "pie", it outputs the correct count.
* When the string contains both "map" and "pie", it outputs the correct count.
* When the string contains "mapie", it correctly subtracts the count to avoid double counting.

The program also handles the case where the string is empty or contains only one character, in which case it outputs 0.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
