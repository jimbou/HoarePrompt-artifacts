Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie' for each test case.

The program uses the `count` method of the string class to count the occurrences of each substring, which is an efficient and accurate way to do so. It also correctly handles the case where 'mapie' is a substring of s, by subtracting its count from the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie'. This is because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie', so counting it separately would result in double-counting.

The program also correctly reads the input from standard input, using `int(input())` to read the integer n and `input()` to read the string s.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
