Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.
2. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` using the `count()` method.
3. It also correctly counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie" in the string `s`, which is a combination of "map" and "pie".
4. The program then prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie" for each test case. This is correct because if "mapie" is present in the string, it means that both "map" and "pie" are also present, so we need to subtract the count of "mapie" to avoid double-counting.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
