Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, as well as the friendship values for each pair of friends.

2. The program calculates the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends.

3. The program correctly calculates the sum of the products of the modular inverses of the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the number of operations, modulo 10^9 + 7, for each test case.

4. The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
