Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
2.  It calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is done using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, which is a common way to calculate modular inverses in Python.
3.  It initializes two variables, `s` and `a`, to zero. `s` will store the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and `a` will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
4.  It reads the `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, which represent the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. It adds the friendship value `f_i` to `a`.
5.  It calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. This is done by adding the product of the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, the current excursion number `i`, the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, and the number of pairs of friends `m` to `s`. It also adds the product of the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs and the sum of the initial friendship values `a` to `s`.
6.  Finally, it prints the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is `E[S] = âˆ‘[i=1 to k] (c \* i \* c \* m + c \* a)`, where `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `i` is the current excursion number, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, and `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values.

Correctness: **True**
