Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers each.

2. It calculates the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children (n * (n - 1) // 2) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends.

3. It calculates the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends, which is used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

4. It calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions by iterating over each excursion and adding the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends, the number of pairs of friends, and the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. It prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, which is:

E[sum of friendship values] = âˆ‘(probability of choosing a pair of friends * number of pairs of friends * sum of friendship values)

The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
