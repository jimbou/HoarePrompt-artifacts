Output State: The `alphabet` string remains unchanged, containing all lowercase English letters. The stdin contains no inputs, as all inputs have been consumed by the loop. The loop has executed a certain number of times (between 1 and 100), and for each execution, it has printed a string of three characters to the stdout. The strings printed are in the format of either 'aaX', 'aXz', or 'Xzz', where X is a lowercase English letter. The total number of strings printed is equal to the initial input integer (1 <= t <= 100).
