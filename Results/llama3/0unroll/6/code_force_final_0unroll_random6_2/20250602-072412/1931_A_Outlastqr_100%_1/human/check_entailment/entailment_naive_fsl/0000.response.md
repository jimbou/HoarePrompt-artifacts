Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. It handles all possible cases by considering the range of the input number `n` and constructing the corresponding word accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the cases:

* If `n > 52`, the program constructs a word by taking the `n-53`th letter of the alphabet and appending 'zz'. This is correct because the maximum sum of three letters is 78 (26+26+26), and `n-53` will give the correct letter for the first position.
* If `n > 27`, the program constructs a word by taking the `n-28`th letter of the alphabet and appending 'az'. This is correct because the sum of the first two letters must be at least 28 to reach a total sum of `n`.
* If `n == 27`, the program constructs the word 'aay'. This is correct because the only way to reach a sum of 27 is with the letters 'a', 'a', and 'y'.
* If `n <= 27`, the program constructs a word by taking the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet and appending 'aa'. This is correct because the sum of the first two letters must be at least 3 to reach a total sum of `n`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each input. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
