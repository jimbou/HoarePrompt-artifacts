Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The encoding is done by summing the positions of the characters in the alphabet.

The provided program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first defines the alphabet as a string of lowercase Latin letters.
2. It then reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer (n) and initializes an empty string (word) to store the decoded word.
4. The program then checks the value of n and constructs the decoded word accordingly:
	* If n is greater than 52, it means the first letter is not 'a' (since 'a' has an index of 1). In this case, it adds the corresponding letter to the word and appends 'zz' to get the lexicographically smallest word.
	* If n is greater than 27, it means the first letter is 'a', and the second letter is not 'a'. In this case, it adds 'a' to the word, followed by the corresponding letter, and then 'z' to get the lexicographically smallest word.
	* If n is equal to 27, it means the word is 'aay', which is the lexicographically smallest word that can be encoded to 27.
	* If n is less than or equal to 27, it means the first two letters are 'aa', and the third letter is the one corresponding to the remaining value (n - 3). In this case, it adds 'aa' to the word and then the corresponding letter.
5. Finally, the program prints the decoded word for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded integer.

Correctness: **True**
