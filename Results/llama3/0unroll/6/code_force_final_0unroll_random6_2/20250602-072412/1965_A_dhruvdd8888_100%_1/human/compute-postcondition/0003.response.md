Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of positive integers containing the number of stones in each pile and 0, ls is the sum of all the numbers in the nums list, nw is True, cw is True**

The code block consists of two lines that assign boolean values to the variables `nw` and `cw`. The first line sets `nw` to `True`, and the second line sets `cw` to `True`. These assignments do not affect the values of `N`, `nums`, or `ls`, which remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the final output state includes the original values of `N`, `nums`, and `ls`, along with the newly assigned values of `nw` and `cw`.
