stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases is given by a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) on the first line of the input.
