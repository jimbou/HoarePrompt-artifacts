stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer and represents the number of piles. The list of integers represents the number of stones in each pile and contains the same number of elements as the first integer. All integers in the list are positive and do not exceed 10^9.
