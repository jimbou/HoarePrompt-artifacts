Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of positive integers containing the number of stones in each pile and 0, ls is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to N. Since the first input is a positive integer, N becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a set of strings representing the space-separated list of integers to nums. The third line adds the string '0' to nums. The fourth line converts all strings in nums to integers and sorts them in ascending order. The fifth line assigns 0 to ls. The value of stdin is reduced by two inputs.
