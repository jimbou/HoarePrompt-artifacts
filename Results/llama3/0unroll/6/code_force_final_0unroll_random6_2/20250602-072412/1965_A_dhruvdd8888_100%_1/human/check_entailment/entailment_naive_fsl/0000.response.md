Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input is a single pile with an even number of stones. In this case, the program will print "Alice" as the winner, but according to the problem description, the first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses. Since there is only one pile, Alice will be the first player to empty it, and therefore she will lose.

For example, if the input is:

1
2

The program will print "Alice", but the correct output should be "Bob".
