Output State: `ans_list` contains multiple integers, each representing the final answer for a test case. The final answer for each test case is calculated based on the input values of n, k, and the sorted list a. The calculation involves iterating through the sorted list, updating the answer and remaining elements based on the difference between consecutive elements and the available value k. The final answer is then appended to `ans_list`.
