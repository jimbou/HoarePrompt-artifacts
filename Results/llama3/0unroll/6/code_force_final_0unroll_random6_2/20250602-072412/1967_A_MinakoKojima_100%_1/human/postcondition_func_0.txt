This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it sorts the integers, calculates a result based on the sorted integers and the value of k, and appends this result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list to the console, one value per line. The function does not modify the input values.
