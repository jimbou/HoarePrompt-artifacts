Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be obtained. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of subarrays that can be formed with the given cards.

The program sorts the cards in ascending order and then tries to form subarrays by adding the difference between the current card and the previous card to the answer. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that the cards can be rearranged to form subarrays.

For example, consider the case where n = 3, k = 4, and the cards are [1, 2, 3]. The program will sort the cards as [1, 2, 3] and then try to form subarrays by adding the difference between the current card and the previous card to the answer. However, this will result in an incorrect answer because the program does not consider the fact that the cards can be rearranged to form subarrays.

A correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm to form subarrays. The algorithm should start by forming subarrays with the smallest possible length (i.e., 1) and then gradually increase the length of the subarrays until it is not possible to form any more subarrays.

Here is a correct implementation of the algorithm:

```python
import math

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)

func()
```

This implementation correctly calculates the maximum score that can be obtained by forming subarrays with the given cards.
