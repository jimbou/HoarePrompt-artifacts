Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it implements a greedy algorithm that splits the input array into two subsequences, `s` and `t`, in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The algorithm works by maintaining two variables, `a` and `b`, which represent the last elements of `s` and `t`, respectively. Initially, `a` and `b` are set to infinity.

The algorithm then iterates through the input array. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`. If `x` is less than or equal to `a`, it updates `a` to `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, it updates `b` to `x`. If `x` is greater than both `a` and `b`, it updates `a` to `x` and increments the penalty counter `c`.

The algorithm ensures that `a` is always less than or equal to `b`, which means that `s` is always a non-increasing subsequence and `t` is always a non-decreasing subsequence. This minimizes the total penalty, as any increase in `s` or `t` would result in a higher penalty.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input array has only one element or where all elements are equal. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
