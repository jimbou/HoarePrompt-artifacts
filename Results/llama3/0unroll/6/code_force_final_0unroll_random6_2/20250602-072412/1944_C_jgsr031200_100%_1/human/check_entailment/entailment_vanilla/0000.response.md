Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, where Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`. The goal is to find the final score of the game if both players play optimally. The score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the elements of the array `arr`. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes the array `arr` as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array using a frequency array `freq`.

The function then iterates over the frequency array and checks for the following conditions:

1. If the frequency of an element is greater than or equal to 2, it skips to the next element.
2. If the frequency of an element is 1, it increments a counter `cou`.
3. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency of an element is 0, it prints the current index `i` and breaks the loop.

The program then calls the function `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

The reasoning behind this program is as follows:

* The frequency array `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
* The counter `cou` is used to keep track of the number of elements that have a frequency of 1.
* The program iterates over the frequency array and checks for the conditions mentioned above. If the frequency of an element is greater than or equal to 2, it skips to the next element because it is not possible for Alice to pick this element and maximize the score. If the frequency of an element is 1, it increments the counter `cou` because this element can be picked by Alice to maximize the score. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency of an element is 0, it prints the current index `i` because this is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array `c`, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
