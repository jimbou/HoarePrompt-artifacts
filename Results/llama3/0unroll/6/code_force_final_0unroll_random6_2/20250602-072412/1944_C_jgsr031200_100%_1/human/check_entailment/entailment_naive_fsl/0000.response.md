Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to find the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a frequency array freq to count the occurrences of each number in the input array arr. It then iterates through the frequency array, and for each number i, it checks if the frequency is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it skips to the next number. If the frequency is 1, it increments a counter cou. If the frequency is 0, it prints the current number i and breaks the loop.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game's rules and the definition of MEX. It correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the input array and uses this information to determine the final score.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are no numbers in the input array, the program will print 0, which is the correct MEX.
* If there is only one number in the input array, the program will print 1, which is the correct MEX.
* If there are multiple numbers in the input array, the program will correctly count the occurrences of each number and determine the final score based on the MEX definition.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
