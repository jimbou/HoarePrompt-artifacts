Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. A new variable `cou` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
