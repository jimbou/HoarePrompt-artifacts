Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. The program first calculates the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n and checks if the frequency of the current number is 1 or 0. If the frequency is 1, it increments the counter `cou`. If `cou` becomes 2 or the frequency of the current number is 0, it prints the current number, which is the smallest number that appears at most once in the array or the smallest number that does not appear in the array.

Correctness: **True**
