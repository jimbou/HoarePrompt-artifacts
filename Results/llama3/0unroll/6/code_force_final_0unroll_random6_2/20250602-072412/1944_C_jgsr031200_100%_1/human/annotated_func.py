#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of non-negative integers where `freq[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `cou` is 2, and the value of `i` is the smallest number in the range [0, n] that appears at most once in `arr`. The value of `freq` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer n as input, calculates the frequency of each integer in the list, and prints the smallest number in the range [0, n] that appears at most once in the list. If no such number exists, it prints the smallest number in the range [0, n] that does not appear in the list. The function does not return any value.
