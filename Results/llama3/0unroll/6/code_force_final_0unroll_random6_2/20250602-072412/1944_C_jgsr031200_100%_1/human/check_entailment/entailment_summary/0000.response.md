Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob minimizes it. The program first calculates the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it iterates over the range [0, n] and checks if the current number appears at most once in the array. If it does, it increments a counter. If the counter reaches 2 or if the current number does not appear in the array, it prints the current number as the final score.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice can maximize the score by choosing the smallest number that appears at most once in the array, while Bob can minimize the score by choosing the smallest number that appears more than once in the array. The program correctly implements this strategy and prints the final score.

Correctness: **True**
