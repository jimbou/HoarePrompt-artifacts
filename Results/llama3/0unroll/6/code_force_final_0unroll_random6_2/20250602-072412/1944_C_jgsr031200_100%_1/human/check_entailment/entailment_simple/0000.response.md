Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the input array `arr` and creates a frequency array `freq` to store the frequency of each number in `arr`.

2. It then iterates over the range `[0, n]` and checks the frequency of each number. If the frequency is 0 or 1, it increments a counter `cou`. If the frequency is greater than 1, it skips to the next number.

3. If `cou` becomes 2 or if it encounters a number with frequency 0, it prints that number as the final score and breaks the loop.

The logic is correct because:

* If a number appears more than once in `arr`, Alice can always pick one of them and Bob can pick the other, resulting in a score of 0 for that number.
* If a number appears exactly once in `arr`, Alice can pick it and Bob cannot, resulting in a score of 1 for that number.
* If a number does not appear in `arr`, the score for that number is 0.

The program correctly finds the smallest number in the range `[0, n]` that appears at most once in `arr`, which is the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
