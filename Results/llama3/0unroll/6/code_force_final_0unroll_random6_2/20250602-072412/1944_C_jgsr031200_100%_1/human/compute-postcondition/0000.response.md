Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers. The new variable `freq` is introduced, which is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is not specified, but it is implied to be a non-negative integer, possibly related to the length or content of the list `arr`.
