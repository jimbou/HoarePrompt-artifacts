Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows deleting an element and inserting its digits in the same position, but the program only inserts the digits at the next position. This can lead to incorrect results when the element being deleted is not the last element in the array.

For example, if the input is [12, 3, 45, 67] and we want to delete the second element (3), the program will insert the digits 3 at the next position, resulting in [12, 3, 3, 45, 67], which is not the correct result according to the problem description. The correct result should be [12, 3, 4, 5, 67].

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the operation and is incorrect.
