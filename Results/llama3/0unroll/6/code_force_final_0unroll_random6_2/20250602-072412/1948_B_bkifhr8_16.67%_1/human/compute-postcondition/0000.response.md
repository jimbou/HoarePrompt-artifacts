Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers, which is a sorted version of `lst`.**

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new variable `sorted_lst` is introduced, which is a sorted version of the original list `lst`. The sorting is done in ascending order by default. The original list `lst` is not modified, and the sorted list is stored in the new variable `sorted_lst`.
