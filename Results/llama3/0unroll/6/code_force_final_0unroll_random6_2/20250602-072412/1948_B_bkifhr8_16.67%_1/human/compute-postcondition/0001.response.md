Output State: **The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted, and False otherwise.**

Explanation: Since `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`, the comparison `lst == sorted_lst` checks if the original list `lst` is already sorted. If `lst` is already sorted, the comparison will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.
