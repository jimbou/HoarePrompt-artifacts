Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
4. The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` are split such that each array has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of an array with equal '+' and '-' characters is 0.
5. The program calculates the minimum possible penalty by subtracting twice the number of '-' characters from the total length of the string `n`. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum of the array, and we want to cancel out these contributions by adding an equal number of '+' characters.
6. However, if the number of '-' characters is equal to the total length of the string `n`, it means that the string consists only of '-' characters. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is simply the total length of the string `n`, because we cannot split the string into arrays with equal '+' and '-' characters.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
