Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters.

2. It correctly calculates the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

3. The program then calculates the minimum possible penalty by using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise `n`. This formula is correct because the penalty is the absolute value of the sum of the array multiplied by its length. 

   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it means that the number of "+" characters is not equal to the number of "-" characters. In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to group all the "+" characters together and all the "-" characters together. The sum of the array will be `n - neg - neg` (the number of "+" characters minus the number of "-" characters), and the length of the array will be `n`. Therefore, the penalty will be `n - 2 * neg`.

   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that the number of "+" characters is equal to the number of "-" characters. In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to group each "+" character with a "-" character. The sum of each group will be 0, and the length of each group will be 2. Therefore, the penalty will be `n`.

4. The program prints the calculated penalty to the standard output.

Correctness: **True**
