The code prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s` of length `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` and the string `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it will output `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to neg, otherwise n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s of length n)**
