Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the input string and then printing the difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of negative signs. If the number of negative signs is equal to the total length of the string, it prints the total length of the string.

The program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly implements the logic of splitting the array into subarrays with alternating signs and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, which is equivalent to the difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of negative signs.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string consists only of positive signs or only of negative signs. In these cases, the program correctly prints the total length of the string as the minimum possible penalty.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
