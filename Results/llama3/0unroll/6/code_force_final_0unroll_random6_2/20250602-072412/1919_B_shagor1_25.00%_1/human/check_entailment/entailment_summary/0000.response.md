Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input string `s` and calculates the number of "-" characters (`neg`) in the string.
2. It then calculates the difference between the total number of characters (`n`) and twice the number of "-" characters (`2 * neg`). This is because each "-" character contributes -1 to the sum, and each "+" character contributes 1. By subtracting twice the number of "-" characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the array `a`.
3. If the total number of characters is equal to the number of "-" characters (`n == neg`), it means that the sum of the array `a` is 0. In this case, the program returns the total number of characters (`n`), which is the minimum possible penalty.
4. Otherwise, the program returns the calculated difference (`n - 2 * neg`), which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
