Functionality: **This function reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer n and a string s of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates the difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of "-" characters in the string. If the total number of characters is equal to the number of "-" characters, it returns the total number of characters. Otherwise, it returns the calculated difference. The function prints the result to the standard output.**
