Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments and performs the following steps:

1. Reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the string `s`.
2. Reads a string `s` from the input, which consists of characters '+' and '-'.
3. Initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '-' characters in the string.
4. Iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is '-', increments the `neg` variable by 1.
5. Prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise prints `n`.

The program then reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a while loop that runs `t` times, calling the `func_1()` function in each iteration.

The reasoning behind the program is as follows:

* The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. Since the sum of a subarray can be either positive or negative, the penalty will be minimized when the sum is 0.
* The sum of a subarray can be 0 only when it contains an equal number of '+' and '-' characters.
* Therefore, the program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg`, where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the number of '-' characters.
* If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that the string contains only '-' characters, and the penalty is `n`.

Correctness: **True**
