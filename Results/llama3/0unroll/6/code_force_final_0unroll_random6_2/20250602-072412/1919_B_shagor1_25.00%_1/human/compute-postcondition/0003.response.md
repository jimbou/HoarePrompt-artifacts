The code prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-".

Output: **neg is the number of '-' characters in s, n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the result of the expression n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n is being printed**
