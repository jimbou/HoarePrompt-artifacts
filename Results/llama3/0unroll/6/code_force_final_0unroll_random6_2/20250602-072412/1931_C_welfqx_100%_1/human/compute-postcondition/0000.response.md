The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= `n`).**
