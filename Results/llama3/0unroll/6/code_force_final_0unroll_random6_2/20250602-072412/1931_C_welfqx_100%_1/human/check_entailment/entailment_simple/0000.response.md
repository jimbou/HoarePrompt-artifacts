Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of an array equal. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if the array is already equal or has only one element. If so, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal, and prints the difference between the length of the array and the maximum of these two lengths.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already equal or has only one element. It also correctly calculates the length of the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal. The use of the `cn` and `ck` variables to keep track of the length of the longest prefix and suffix, respectively, is a good approach. The program also correctly prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

However, the program can be improved for better readability and efficiency. For example, the variable names `f`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are not very descriptive and could be renamed to better indicate their purpose. Additionally, the program uses a lot of repeated code, which could be refactored into separate functions to improve readability and maintainability.

Correctness: **True**
