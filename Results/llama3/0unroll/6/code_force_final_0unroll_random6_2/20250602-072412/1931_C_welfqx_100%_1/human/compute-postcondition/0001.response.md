Output State: **The output state will contain `t` lines, each representing the minimum number of operations required to make the corresponding input array `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` a palindrome. If the input array is already a palindrome or has only one element, the output will be 0. Otherwise, the output will be the difference between the length of the array `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck`, where `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of the array that is a palindrome, and `ck` is the length of the longest suffix of the array that is a palindrome.**
