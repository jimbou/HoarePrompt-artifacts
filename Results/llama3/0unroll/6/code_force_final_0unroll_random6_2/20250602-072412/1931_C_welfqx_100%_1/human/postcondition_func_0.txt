This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of operations required to make each input array a palindrome. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly. The function takes an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, representing the length of the array, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The function calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array a palindrome and prints this value for each test case. If the input array is already a palindrome or has only one element, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is the difference between the length of the array n and the maximum of the lengths of the longest prefix and suffix that are palindromes.
