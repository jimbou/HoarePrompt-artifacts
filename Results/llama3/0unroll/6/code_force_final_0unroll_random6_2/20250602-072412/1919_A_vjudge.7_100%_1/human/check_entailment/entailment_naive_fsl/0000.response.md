Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins is even (a + b & 1 == 0). If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because if the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of coins, allowing Bob to make the last move.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It does not matter what the individual values of a and b are, as long as their sum is even or odd, the program will correctly determine the winner.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
