Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The key insight to this problem is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move. This is because the last move will always be to remove the last coin from the opponent's wallet, leaving them with an empty wallet and unable to make a valid move.

The program uses the fact that the sum of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is either even or odd. If the sum is even, then Alice and Bob will alternate making moves, and Bob will have the opportunity to make the last move, winning the game. If the sum is odd, then Alice will have the opportunity to make the last move, winning the game.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator `&`. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

Correctness: **True**
