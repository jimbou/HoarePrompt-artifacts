Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program uses a simple and elegant approach to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (&). If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", otherwise it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. Since each player can only remove one coin at a time, the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) will alternate between even and odd on each turn. If the sum is even, Bob will win, because he will always have a valid move (either swapping wallets or removing a coin). If the sum is odd, Alice will win, because she will always have a valid move (either swapping wallets or removing a coin).

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
