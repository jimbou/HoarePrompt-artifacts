Output State: **The output will be a series of 'Bob' and 'Alice' printed to the console, where 'Bob' is printed when the sum of a and b is even, and 'Alice' is printed when the sum of a and b is odd. The number of lines printed will be equal to the value of `test`. The value of `test` remains unchanged. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes execution.**
