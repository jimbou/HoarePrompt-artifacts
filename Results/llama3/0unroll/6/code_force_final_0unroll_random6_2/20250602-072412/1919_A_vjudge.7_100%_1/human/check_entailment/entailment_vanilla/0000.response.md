Reasoning:

The problem is asking to determine who will win a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.

The provided program uses a simple approach to solve the problem. It takes the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the sum of the coins is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, which means Bob will always have a valid move. On the other hand, if the sum of the coins is odd, Alice will always have a valid move, and Bob will be forced to make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of coins.

This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that the players can exchange wallets and remove coins, and it uses the parity of the sum of the coins to determine who will win.

Correctness: **True**
