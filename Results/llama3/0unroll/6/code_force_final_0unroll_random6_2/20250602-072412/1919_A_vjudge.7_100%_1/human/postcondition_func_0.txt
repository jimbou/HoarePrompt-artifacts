This function reads a series of input lines from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer 'test' representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers 'a' and 'b'. It then prints 'Bob' to the console if the sum of 'a' and 'b' is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, repeating this process for each test case. The function does not return any value, and its only effect is printing the results to the console.
