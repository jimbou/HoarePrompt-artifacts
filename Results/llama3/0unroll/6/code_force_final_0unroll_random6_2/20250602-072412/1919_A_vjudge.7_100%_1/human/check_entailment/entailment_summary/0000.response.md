Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move involves choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, followed by removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, and that player loses.

The provided program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, the program prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob wins. If the sum is odd, the program prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice wins.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. Since each player removes 1 coin from their wallet on their turn, the total number of coins in both wallets decreases by 1 on each turn. If the sum of the coins is even initially, it will remain even after each turn. Similarly, if the sum is odd initially, it will remain odd after each turn.

Since Alice makes the first move, she will always be the one to make the move that changes the parity of the sum from even to odd or vice versa. Therefore, if the sum is even initially, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd initially, Alice will win.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and printing the corresponding winner.

Correctness: **True**
