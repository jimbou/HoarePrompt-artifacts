Output State: **`path` is a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and this is printed: "! [path]" where path is a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is immediately written to the console. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
