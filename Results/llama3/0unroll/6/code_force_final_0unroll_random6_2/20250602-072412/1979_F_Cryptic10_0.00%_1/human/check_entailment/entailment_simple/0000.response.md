Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It uses a greedy approach to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph. The program repeatedly asks queries to find a vertex with the minimum degree that is not connected to another vertex. It then adds this vertex to the path and removes it from the graph. This process is repeated until all vertices have been added to the path.

The program is correct because it ensures that each vertex is added to the path at most once, and it never adds a vertex that is already in the path. This is guaranteed by the fact that the program removes each vertex from the graph after adding it to the path.

Additionally, the program ensures that the path is a Hamiltonian path by only adding vertices that are not connected to another vertex in the path. This is guaranteed by the fact that the program asks queries to find a vertex with the minimum degree that is not connected to another vertex.

Therefore, the program is correct and will always find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.

Correctness: **True**
