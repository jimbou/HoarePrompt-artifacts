Output State: **path is a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, remaining_vertices is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `path` will contain all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in some order, and the set `remaining_vertices` will be empty. This is because the loop continues to execute until all vertices have been added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
