    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State: *i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr, arr remains unchanged. i is less than or equal to j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:

        #The program returns the number of elements in the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index j, which is j - i + 1, where i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr and j is the current index.
    #State: *i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged. i is less than or equal to j, and j is equal to the last index of arr
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the last index of array 'arr' and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the length of the longest subarray that starts with a mismatched element from the start and end of the input array. It returns 0 if the input array is a palindrome, the number of elements in the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index j if j is not the last index, or the difference between the last index and the index of the first mismatched element if j is the last index.
