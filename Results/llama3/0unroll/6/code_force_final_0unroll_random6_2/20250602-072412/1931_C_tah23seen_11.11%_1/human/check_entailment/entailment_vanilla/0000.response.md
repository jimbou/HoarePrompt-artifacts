Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first checking if the array is already sorted in a way that the operation is not needed (i.e., the array is already equal from the start to the end). If not, it tries to find the longest prefix of the array that is equal to the first element, and then checks if the rest of the array is equal to the last element. If so, it returns the length of the middle part of the array that needs to be changed.

However, this approach is not correct. The problem statement allows for selecting any three integers i, j, and x, and assigning all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. The program does not consider all possible combinations of i, j, and x.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. The program will return 4, but the correct answer is 3, because we can select i = 2, j = 4, and x = 8, and assign all elements of the array with indexes from 2 to 4 the value 8, resulting in the array [1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1].

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
