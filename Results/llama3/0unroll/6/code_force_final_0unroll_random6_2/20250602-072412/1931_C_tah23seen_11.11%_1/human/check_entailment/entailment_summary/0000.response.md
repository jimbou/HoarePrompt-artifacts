Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of burles (i.e., the minimum number of elements that need to be changed) to make all elements of the array equal. However, the provided program does not correctly solve this problem.

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the input array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and end of the array. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0. Otherwise, it finds the first mismatched element from the start and end of the array and returns the length of the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index `j` (or the difference between the last index and the index of the first mismatched element if `j` is the last index).

However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem. The problem allows for changing a subarray of elements to a single value, not just changing individual elements. The program does not consider this and only checks for palindromes.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The program will return 4, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 5, because we can change the entire array to a single value (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`) with 5 burles.

Correctness: **False**
