Output State: **The program returns the number of elements in the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index j, which is j - i + 1, where i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr and j is the current index.**

In this output state, the program returns the length of the subarray that starts from the first mismatched element (at index i) and ends at the current index j. Since i is the index of the first mismatched element, it is less than or equal to j, and j is not equal to the last index of arr, the returned value is a positive integer that represents the number of elements in this subarray.
