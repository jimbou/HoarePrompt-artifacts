Functionality: **This function determines the length of the longest subarray that starts with a mismatched element from the start and end of the input array. It returns 0 if the input array is a palindrome, the number of elements in the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index j if j is not the last index, or the difference between the last index and the index of the first mismatched element if j is the last index.**
