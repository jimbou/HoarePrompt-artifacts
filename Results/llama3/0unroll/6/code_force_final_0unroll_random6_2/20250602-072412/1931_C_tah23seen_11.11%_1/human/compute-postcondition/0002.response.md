Output State: **i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr, arr remains unchanged**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable i now points to the first element from the start of the array arr that does not match the corresponding element from the end. Similarly, the variable j points to the first element from the end of the array arr that does not match the corresponding element from the start. The array arr itself remains unchanged, as the loop only increments or decrements the indices i and j without modifying the array elements.
