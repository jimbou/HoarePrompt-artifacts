Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, j is the last index of arr**

In this code snippet, two new variables `i` and `j` are introduced. The first line assigns the value 0 to `i`, and the second line assigns the last index of the list `arr` to `j`. The list `arr` remains unchanged. The final state includes the original list `arr` and the newly introduced variables `i` and `j` with their assigned values.
