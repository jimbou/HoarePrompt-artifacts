Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (a unit of cost) required to make all elements of an array equal by applying a single operation that assigns a value to all elements in a subarray.

The function `func_1(arr)` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The program first checks if the array is already equal by comparing elements from the start and end of the array. If the array is already equal, it returns 0.

If the array is not equal, it finds the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array (`i`) and the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array (`j`).

The program then checks if the first mismatched element from the start is the same as the next element. If it is, it increments `i` until it finds a mismatched element.

If `j` is not the last index of the array, the program returns the number of elements in the subarray from the first mismatched element to the current index `j`, which is `j - i + 1`.

If `j` is the last index of the array, the program returns the difference between the last index of the array and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array, which is `j - i`.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
