Output State: i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr.

In natural language, the output state is the indices of the first pair of elements from the start and end of the array that do not match. If all elements in the array are the same, the output state will be i equal to the length of the array and j equal to -1 (since j is the last index of arr, it will be decremented until it is less than i).
