Output State: **i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged. i is less than or equal to j**

In this output state, the loop has iterated through the array `arr` from the start, incrementing `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next one. Once it finds a mismatch (i.e., `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`), the loop exits, leaving `i` pointing to the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The value of `j`, which is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array, remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop. The array `arr` itself also remains unchanged.
