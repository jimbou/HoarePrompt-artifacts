#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. The second line contains a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program has printed out either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case, indicating whether Dmitry's favorite cube can be seen after the removal of k cubes, and the values of the variables t, a, b, o, n, f, k, fav, dic, and l have been updated accordingly for each test case. The stdin still contains the input values, but the program has already read and processed them. The program has also printed out the results for each test case, which can be 'YES' if the favorite cube can be seen, 'NO' if it cannot be seen, or 'MAYBE' if it can be seen but only if some cubes are removed in a specific order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. The second line contains a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes. For each test case, the function determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube can be seen after removing the specified number of cubes and prints 'YES' if it can be seen, 'NO' if it cannot be seen, or 'MAYBE' if it can be seen but only if some cubes are removed in a specific order.
