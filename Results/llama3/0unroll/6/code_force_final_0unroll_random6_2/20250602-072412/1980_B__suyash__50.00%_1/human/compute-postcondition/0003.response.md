Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. The second line contains a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes. For each test case, the function determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube can be seen after removing the specified number of cubes and prints 'YES' if it can be seen, 'NO' if it cannot be seen, or 'MAYBE' if it can be seen but only if some cubes are removed in a specific order.**
