Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. The second line contains a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes.

When the code `t = int(input())` is executed, it reads the first integer from the first line of the first test case, which is the number of cubes. Let's call this integer `num_cubes`.

The value of `t` is now equal to `num_cubes`.

The stdin still contains the remaining input, which is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, the number of removed cubes, and the list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes.

Output State: **`t` is equal to the number of cubes in the first test case, stdin contains the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, the number of removed cubes, and the list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes.**
