Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when the favorite cube's value is not unique and the number of removed cubes is equal to the number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube's value. In this case, the program will print "MAYBE" instead of "YES".

For example, consider the input:

5 2 3
4 3 3 2 3

In this case, the favorite cube's value is 3, which is not unique. The program will sort the cubes in non-increasing order and remove the first 3 cubes. Since the favorite cube's value is not unique, it may be removed or left, depending on its position in the sorted list. However, the program will print "MAYBE" instead of "YES", which is incorrect.

The correct output for this case should be "YES", because the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, regardless of its position in the sorted list.
