Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a sequence of n numbers. The numbers in each sequence will be arranged in a specific pattern, where the numbers at even indices will be decreasing from n, and the numbers at odd indices will be increasing from 1 (or 2 if n is even), with a step of 2. For example, if n = 5, the output will be "5 2 3 4 1". If n = 6, the output will be "6 4 5 2 3 1".**
