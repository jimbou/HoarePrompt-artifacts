This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n. It then generates a sequence of n numbers, arranging them in a specific pattern where numbers at even indices decrease from n and numbers at odd indices increase from 1 (or 2 if n is even) with a step of 2. The function prints each generated sequence on a new line, resulting in a total of t lines of output, where t is the number of test cases.
