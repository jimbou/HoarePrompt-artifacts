The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`. The first input is the number of test cases, which is assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs are the test cases, which are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, and the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
