Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of printed values, each representing the calculated value of `ans` for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case are consumed by the loop and do not persist after the loop finishes. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it calculates and prints the value of `ans` based on the values of `n` and `m` for that test case.
