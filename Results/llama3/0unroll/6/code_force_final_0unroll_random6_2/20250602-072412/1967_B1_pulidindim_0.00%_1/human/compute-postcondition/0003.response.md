Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates and prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the result of a series of calculations involving n and m. The function iterates over all test cases, consuming the input values of n and m, and produces a series of printed values, each representing the calculated `ans` for a test case.**
