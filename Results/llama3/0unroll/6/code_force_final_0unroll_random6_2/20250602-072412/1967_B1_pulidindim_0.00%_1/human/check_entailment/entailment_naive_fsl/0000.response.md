Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where it calculates `g = n / count`. This line assumes that `n` is always divisible by `count`, which is not necessarily true. If `n` is not divisible by `count`, the result of `g` will be a floating-point number, and the subsequent calculations will be incorrect.

For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `m = 3`. The program will calculate `g = 10 / 3 = 3.33`, which is incorrect because `g` should be an integer. This will lead to incorrect results in the subsequent calculations.

To fix this issue, the program should use integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`) to calculate `g`. Additionally, the program should also handle the case where `n` is not divisible by `count` correctly.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n // count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g // count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```
With this correction, the program should produce the correct results for all inputs.
