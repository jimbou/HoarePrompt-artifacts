The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers (a_1 to a_n), and a string of n characters ('L' and 'R'). It then performs a series of modular multiplications based on the direction of the characters in the string, either multiplying the current result by the next or previous integer in the list. The function outputs a list of integers, where each integer is the result of these modular multiplications, in the reverse order of the input list. The function repeats this process for each test case.
