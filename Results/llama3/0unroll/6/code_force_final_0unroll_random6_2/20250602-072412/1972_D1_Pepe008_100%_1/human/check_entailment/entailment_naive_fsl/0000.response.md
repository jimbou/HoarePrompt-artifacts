Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the value of `x`. The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct.

A counterexample is when `a = 10` and `b = 8`. The program will output `12`, but the correct answer is `14`. This is because the program is not correctly counting the number of pairs where `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

For example, the pair `(10, 2)` is not counted by the program, but it satisfies the conditions because `10+2 = 12` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(10, 2) = 2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
