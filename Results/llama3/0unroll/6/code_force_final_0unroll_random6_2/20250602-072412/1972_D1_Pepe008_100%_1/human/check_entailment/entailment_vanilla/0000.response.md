Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `i`. The program uses the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs for each `i`.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program is subtracting 2 from the final result, which is not justified by the problem statement. This subtraction is likely an attempt to correct for some error, but it is not clear what error it is intended to correct.

2. The program is using the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs for each `i`. However, this formula is not correct. The correct formula should be based on the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)`, which is not taken into account by this formula.

3. The program is iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `b`, which is not necessary. The problem statement only requires `a+b` to be a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`, which means that `i` only needs to be a divisor of `b`.

4. The program is not correctly handling the case where `a` is less than `i * (i - 1)`. In this case, the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` will produce a negative result, which is not valid.

5. The program is not correctly handling the case where `a` is equal to `i * (i - 1)`. In this case, the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` will produce a result of 1, but the program is adding an additional 1 to the result, which is not correct.

Overall, the program is not correctly solving the problem and is producing incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
