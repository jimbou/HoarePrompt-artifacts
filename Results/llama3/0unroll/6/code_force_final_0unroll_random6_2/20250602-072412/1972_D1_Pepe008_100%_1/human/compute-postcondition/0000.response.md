Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by the code, and the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.
