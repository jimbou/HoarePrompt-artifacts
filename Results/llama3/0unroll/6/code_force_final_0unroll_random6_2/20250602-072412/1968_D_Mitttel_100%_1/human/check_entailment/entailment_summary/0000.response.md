Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the input values for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and adjusts the indices to be 0-based.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position `s` and with a limited number of steps `k`. This function correctly implements the logic to traverse the permutation, accumulate values from the array, and keep track of the maximum score that can be achieved within the given number of steps.

4. The program then calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions and compares their scores. If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw". If Bodya's score is higher, it prints "Bodya". Otherwise, it prints "Sasha".

5. The execution summary provided confirms that the `func_1` function correctly calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player within the given number of steps.

Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
