Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is an integer equal to the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged, with the addition of new variables introduced by the code. The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `p`, which is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p). The variables `mx` and `cur` are initialized to 0, and the list `vis` is created with `n` zeros, where `n` is the length of `p`.
