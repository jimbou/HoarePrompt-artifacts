Output State: **vis[s] is 1, mx is the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is the sum of a[s] and the previous value of cur, k is k - 1, and s is p[s].**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable vis[s] has been set to 1, indicating that the current state s has been visited. The variable mx now holds the maximum value between its previous value and the sum of cur, k, and a[s]. The variable cur has been updated to include the value of a[s]. The variable k has been decremented by 1. Finally, the variable s has been updated to point to the next state p[s].
