Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation and accumulate scores based on the values in an array. The game lasts for a certain number of turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by each player within the given number of turns. This function iterates through the permutation, accumulating scores and updating the maximum score that can be achieved within the remaining turns.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for both players, and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by each player, and the main part of the program correctly compares the scores to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
