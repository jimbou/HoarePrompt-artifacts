Output State: vis is a list of n integers such that 1 <= vis_i <= 1, mx is a non-negative integer, cur is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, and s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p).

The output state is the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable vis is a list of n integers, where each integer represents the number of times the corresponding index in the list p has been visited. The variable mx is the maximum value of the expression cur + k * a[s] during the execution of the loop. The variable cur is the sum of the values of a[s] for all iterations of the loop. The variable k is the remaining number of iterations after the loop has finished. The variable s is the final value of the list of two non-negative integers, which represents the last index visited in the list p.
