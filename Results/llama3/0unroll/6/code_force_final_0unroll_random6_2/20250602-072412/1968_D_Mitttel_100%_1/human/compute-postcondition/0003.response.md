Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s], where mx is the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is the sum of a[s] and the previous value of cur, k is k - 1, and s is p[s].**

In this output state, the program returns the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s]. The value of mx is the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s], which means it is the maximum value of the current mx and the sum of cur and k times a[s]. The value of cur is the sum of a[s] and the previous value of cur, which means it is the sum of the current a[s] and the previous value of cur. The value of k is k - 1, which means it is one less than the previous value of k. The value of s is p[s], which means it is the value of p at index s.
