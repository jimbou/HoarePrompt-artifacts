Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. 

The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns. It does this by simulating the game and keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved at each step.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for both players, and then compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` can be up to 10^9), by only simulating the game for the number of turns that are actually needed to determine the maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
