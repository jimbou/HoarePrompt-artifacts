Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, the program will print "YES" and output 2 6 1, but this is not a correct solution because Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall and 4 jewels at the second stall, for a total of 5 jewels, but the program claims she will buy 6 jewels.

The program only checks if n == k or if n + 2 > k * 2, but it does not consider other cases where it is possible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, it is possible to set up the stalls with prices 2 and 4, so that Alice buys 5 jewels in total.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible cases.
