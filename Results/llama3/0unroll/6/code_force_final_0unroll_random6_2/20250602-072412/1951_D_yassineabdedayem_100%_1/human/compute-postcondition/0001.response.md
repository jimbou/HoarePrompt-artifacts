Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. If 'YES', it will be followed by two more lines: the first line will contain either 1 or 2, and the second line will contain either a single number (1) or two numbers (n - k + 1 and 1). The value of t and the values of n and k in each line of stdin will be unchanged.**
