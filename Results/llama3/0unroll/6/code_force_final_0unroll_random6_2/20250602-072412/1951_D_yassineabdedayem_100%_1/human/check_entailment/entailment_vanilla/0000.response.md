Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If this is the case, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, and the second stall has a price of 1. This allows Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Correctness: **True**
