Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where Alice has exactly the same amount of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (n == k), and where Alice has more than twice the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy minus 2 (n + 2 > k * 2). In the first case, the program prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels. In the second case, the program prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls, one with a price of n - k + 1 and the other with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

The program also correctly handles the case where it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, printing 'NO' in this case.

Correctness: **True**
