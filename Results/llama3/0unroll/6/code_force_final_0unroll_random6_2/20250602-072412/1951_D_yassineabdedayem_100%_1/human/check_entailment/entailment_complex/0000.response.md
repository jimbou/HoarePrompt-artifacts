Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes into account the greedy behavior of Alice and the constraints on the number of stalls and prices.

The program first checks if n is equal to k, in which case the solution is trivial (one stall with a price of 1). If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If this condition is true, it means that Bob can set up two stalls: one with a price of n - k + 1 and another with a price of 1. This will ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

If neither of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up his store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. The output format is also correct, as it follows the specified format for 'YES' and 'NO' cases.

Correctness: **True**
