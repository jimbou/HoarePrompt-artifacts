Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. If n equals k, then Alice can buy exactly k jewels from a single stall with a price of 1. The program correctly outputs 'YES' and the price for a single stall.

2. If n + 2 is greater than k * 2, then Alice can buy exactly k jewels from two stalls. The first stall will have a price of n - k + 1, and the second stall will have a price of 1. The program correctly outputs 'YES' and the prices for the two stalls.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, then it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
