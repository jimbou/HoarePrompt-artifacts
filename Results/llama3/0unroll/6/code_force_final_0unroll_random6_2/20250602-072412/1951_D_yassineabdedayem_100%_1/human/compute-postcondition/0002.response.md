Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two positive integers n and k. It then determines whether it's possible to satisfy a certain condition based on the values of n and k. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES' followed by a specific output format indicating the solution; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and produces the corresponding output for each case, leaving the input values unchanged.**
