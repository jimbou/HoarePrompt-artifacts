Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7). t is an integer equal to its original value minus one, ans_f is an empty list.**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to t. Since t is between 1 and 5000, this line will consume one integer from stdin, leaving t-1 test cases. The second line initializes an empty list called ans_f. No other variables are affected.
