Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by 2n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum pairs of integers and stores the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated sums to the console.**
