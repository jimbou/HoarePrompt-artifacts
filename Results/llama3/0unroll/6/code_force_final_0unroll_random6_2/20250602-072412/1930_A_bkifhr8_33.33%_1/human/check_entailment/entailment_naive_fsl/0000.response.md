Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list `lst`. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. 

The expression `0 * 2` always evaluates to `0`, so the program is always removing the first element of the list twice, which is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect results or even an `IndexError` if the list has less than two elements.

For example, if the input is `3` and the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will remove the first element `1` twice, resulting in an incorrect list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Then, it will add the minimum of the first two elements of the remaining list to the score, which is `2`, and remove the first two elements again, resulting in an incorrect list `[4, 5, 6]`. This process will continue, resulting in an incorrect final score.

To fix this issue, the program should sort the list in ascending order and then remove the smallest two elements in each iteration. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            ans += lst[2 * i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected program first sorts the list in ascending order and then removes the smallest two elements in each iteration by adding the smallest element to the score and removing the smallest two elements from the list. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
