Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It iterates over each character in the input string, checking every substring of length 3 to see if it matches 'map' or 'pie'. If a match is found, it increments the counter 'ans' and moves the index 'i' 3 positions forward. If no match is found, it simply moves the index 'i' 1 position forward. This process continues until the end of the string is reached. The program then prints the total count of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
