Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates over the string, checking every substring of length 3. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the count and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward. This ensures that the program correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
