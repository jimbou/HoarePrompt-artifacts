Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and output 2, but the correct output should be 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

In the given program, the while loop checks for substrings of length 3, and if it finds a match, it increments the index `i` by 3. However, this approach does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. A correct approach would be to check for substrings of length 3 and 4 (for "mapie") and handle the overlapping cases accordingly.
