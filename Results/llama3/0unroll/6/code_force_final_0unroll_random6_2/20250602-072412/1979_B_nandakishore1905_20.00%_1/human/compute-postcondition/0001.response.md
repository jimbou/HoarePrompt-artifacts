Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two space-separated non-negative integers x and y. It calculates the absolute difference between x and y, and then performs specific operations based on the conditions: if the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference; if x is 0 and y is odd, it prints 1; if x is 0 and y is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference minus the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference. The function outputs the results of these operations for each test case.**
