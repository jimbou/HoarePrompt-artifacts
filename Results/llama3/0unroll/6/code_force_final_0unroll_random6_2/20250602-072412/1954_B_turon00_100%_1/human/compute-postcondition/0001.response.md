Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the corresponding test case. If the first element occurs only once or is the only element in the test case, the output is -1. The output list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the input.**
