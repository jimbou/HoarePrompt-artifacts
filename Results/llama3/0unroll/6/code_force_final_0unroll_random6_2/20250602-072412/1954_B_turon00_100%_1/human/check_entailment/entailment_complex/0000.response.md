Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the array elements.
2.  It initializes variables to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`cnt`) and the minimum count seen so far (`ans`).
3.  The program iterates through each array, updating `cnt` when it encounters the first element and updating `ans` when it encounters a different element or reaches the end of the array.
4.  After processing each array, the program checks if the minimum count is equal to the array size or if the array size is 1. If either condition is true, it outputs -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
