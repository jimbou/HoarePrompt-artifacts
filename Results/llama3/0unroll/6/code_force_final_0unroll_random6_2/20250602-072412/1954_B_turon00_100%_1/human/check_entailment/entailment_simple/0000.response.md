Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program iterates through each test case, reads the array, and keeps track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the minimum count (ans) whenever it encounters a different element or reaches the end of the array.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array has only one element or the first element occurs only once, in which case it outputs -1.

However, the program assumes that the input array is always beautiful, as stated in the problem description. If the input array is not beautiful, the program may produce incorrect results.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states provided, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
