Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since we have already read one integer. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing a single integer n and the second line containing n integers.
