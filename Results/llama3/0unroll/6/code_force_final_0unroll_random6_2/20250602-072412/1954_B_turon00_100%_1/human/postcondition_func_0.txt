This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in each test case. If the first element occurs only once or is the only element in the test case, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the same order as the input.
