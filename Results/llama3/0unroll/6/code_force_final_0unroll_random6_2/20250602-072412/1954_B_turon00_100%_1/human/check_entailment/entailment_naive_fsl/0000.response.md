Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only two distinct elements, and the first and last elements are the same. In this case, the program will output the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element, which is not the correct answer.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 3, because we need to remove at least three elements to make the array not beautiful.

The program only checks for the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it does not consider the case where the first and last elements are the same and there are other elements in between. Therefore, it is incorrect.
