Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element. If the first element occurs only once or is the only element in the array, it outputs -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when the first element occurs only once. It also correctly calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
