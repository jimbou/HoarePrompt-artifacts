Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It first calculates the total space required for the 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and then determines the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. It then checks if the remaining space on these screens is enough to accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the number of 1x1 or 2x2 icons is 0, and the cases where the total space required is a multiple of 15 (the size of a screen). It also correctly handles the cases where the number of 2x2 icons is odd, in which case an additional screen is needed to accommodate the remaining 2x2 icon.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
