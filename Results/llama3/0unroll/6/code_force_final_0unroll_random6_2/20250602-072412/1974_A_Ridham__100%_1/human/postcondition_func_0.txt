This function reads a series of input pairs (x, y) from stdin, calculates the total number of screens required for each pair based on specific space requirements, and prints a list of these screen counts. The function takes no explicit parameters but consumes input from stdin, and its output is a list of integers representing the total screens required for each input pair.
