Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. For each test case, it calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'No' otherwise. The function repeats this process for a number of test cases specified by an initial integer t, and outputs a sequence of 'Yes' or 'No' results, one for each test case.**
