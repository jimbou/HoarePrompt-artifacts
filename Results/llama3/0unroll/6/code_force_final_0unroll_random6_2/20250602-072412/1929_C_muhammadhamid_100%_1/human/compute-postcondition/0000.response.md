Output State: **The output state will be a sequence of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, indicating whether the value of 'a' is greater than or equal to the calculated value of 's' after the inner loop execution. The number of 'Yes' or 'No' outputs will be equal to the value of 't' in the initial state.**
