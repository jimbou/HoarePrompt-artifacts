Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described above. The program uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, which represent the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively.
3. The program initializes a variable `s` to 1, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.
4. The program then iterates `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses. In each iteration, it calculates the new value of `s` by adding the current value of `s` divided by `(k - 1)` (rounded up to the nearest integer) plus 1. This is because Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses, and in each loss, he loses the entire bet amount.
5. After the loop, the program checks if the initial number of coins Sasha has (`a`) is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount of coins (`s`). If it is, the program prints "Yes", indicating that Sasha can guarantee that he can win any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
