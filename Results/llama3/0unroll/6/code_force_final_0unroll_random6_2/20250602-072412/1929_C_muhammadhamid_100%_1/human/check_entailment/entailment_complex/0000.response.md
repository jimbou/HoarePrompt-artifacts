Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee winning any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have in this scenario is calculated as s.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins Sasha has (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s. If it is, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement, including the range of values for k, x, and a. It also correctly repeats the process for the specified number of test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
