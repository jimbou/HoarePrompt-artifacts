Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The variable `s` represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. The loop calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to recover from `x` consecutive losses, and the program prints "Yes" if Sasha has at least this amount of coins, and "No" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `x` is 1 or `a` is 1. The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is 2, which is the minimum possible value of `k`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
