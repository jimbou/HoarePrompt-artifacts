Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain two strings s and f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second and third lines contain two strings `s` and `f` of `n` characters, where each character is either '1' or '0' representing the presence or absence of a cat in a box.
