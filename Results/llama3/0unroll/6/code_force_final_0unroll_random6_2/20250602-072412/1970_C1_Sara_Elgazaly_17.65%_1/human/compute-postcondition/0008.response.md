Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs an undirected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph starting from node 1. The DFS traversal alternates between two states (True and False) at each step. After the traversal is complete, the function prints 'Hermione' if the final state is True and 'Ron' if the final state is False.**
