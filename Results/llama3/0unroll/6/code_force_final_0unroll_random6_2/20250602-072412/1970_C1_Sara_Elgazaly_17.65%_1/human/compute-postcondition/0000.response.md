Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the values of the first two integers from stdin to `x` and `y`. Since `x` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and `y` is 1, `x` becomes an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and `y` becomes 1. The second line creates an empty dictionary `lst`. No other variables are affected. Stdin still contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
