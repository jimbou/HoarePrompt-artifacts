Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary containing n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and each value is a list containing one or more integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and s is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
