Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary to store the count of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and checks if there are any numbers in the dictionary that have the same remainder when divided by x and y. If there are, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

However, the program has a logical error. The line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. This line is trying to calculate the remainder of -num when divided by x, but the modulo operator in Python returns the remainder of the division of the number before it by the number after it, not the negative of the number before it. 

To fix this error, the line should be changed to `mod_x = (x - num % x) % x`. This will correctly calculate the remainder of -num when divided by x.

Another issue with the program is that it is counting each pair twice. For example, if (i, j) is a beautiful pair, the program will count it once when it encounters a_i and again when it encounters a_j. To fix this, the program should only count each pair once. This can be done by only considering pairs where i < j.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_xy_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_xy = (num % x, num % y)
            mod_xy_key = ((x - num % x) % x, num % y)
            count += mod_xy_map.get(mod_xy_key, 0)
            mod_xy_map[mod_xy] = mod_xy_map.get(mod_xy, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
