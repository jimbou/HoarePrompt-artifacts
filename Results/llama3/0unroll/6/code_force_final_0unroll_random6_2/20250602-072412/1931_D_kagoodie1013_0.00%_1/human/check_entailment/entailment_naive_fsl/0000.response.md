Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The issue lies in the way it counts the pairs. It increments the count by the number of occurrences of the modular inverses of the current number modulo x and y, but it does not consider the fact that the pairs must have distinct indices.

For example, if the input is:

6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6

The program will count the pair (1, 1) as a beautiful pair, which is incorrect because the indices are not distinct.

To fix this issue, the program should only count the pairs where the indices are distinct. This can be achieved by using a different approach, such as using two nested loops to iterate over the array and count the pairs manually.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

This implementation correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array by iterating over all pairs of distinct indices and checking if the sum and difference of the corresponding elements are divisible by x and y, respectively.
