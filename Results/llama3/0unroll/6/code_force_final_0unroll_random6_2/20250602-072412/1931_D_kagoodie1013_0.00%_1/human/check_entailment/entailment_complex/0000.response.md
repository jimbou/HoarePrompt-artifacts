Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two dictionaries, mod_x_map and mod_y_map, to store the count of numbers in the array that have the same remainder when divided by x and y, respectively. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and increments the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions by the count of numbers that have the same remainder.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is currently counting the pairs of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by both x and y, but it is not considering the condition that a_i + a_j should be divisible by x and a_i - a_j should be divisible by y.

To fix this, the program should be modified to count the pairs of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and have the same remainder when divided by y, but with opposite signs. This is because a_i + a_j is divisible by x if and only if a_i and a_j have the same remainder when divided by x, and a_i - a_j is divisible by y if and only if a_i and a_j have the same remainder when divided by y but with opposite signs.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_xy_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_xy_map.get((-mod_x) % x, 0).get(mod_y, 0) + mod_xy_map.get(mod_x, {}).get((-mod_y) % y, 0)
            if mod_x not in mod_xy_map:
                mod_xy_map[mod_x] = {}
            mod_xy_map[mod_x][mod_y] = mod_xy_map[mod_x].get(mod_y, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
