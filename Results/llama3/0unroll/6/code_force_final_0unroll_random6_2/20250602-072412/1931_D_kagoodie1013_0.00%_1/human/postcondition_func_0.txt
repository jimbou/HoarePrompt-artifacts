This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by counting the total number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the conditions `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y == a_j % y`, where `a_i` and `a_j` are numbers in the test case array. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case, without modifying the input test cases.
