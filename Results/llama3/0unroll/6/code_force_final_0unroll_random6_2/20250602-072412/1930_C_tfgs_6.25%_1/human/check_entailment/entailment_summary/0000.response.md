Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem description.
2. It modifies the array `a` by adding the 1-based index plus one to each element, which is the first step in the problem description.
3. It removes duplicates from the array `a` by converting it to a set, which is the second step in the problem description.
4. It sorts the array `a` in descending order, which is the third step in the problem description.
5. It reconstructs the array `b` by inserting missing numbers between the elements of `a` and repeating each element a number of times equal to its frequency in the original array `a`. This is done by iterating through the sorted array `a` and inserting the missing numbers between each pair of elements.
6. Finally, it appends any remaining missing numbers at the end of the array `b` and prints the resulting array.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
