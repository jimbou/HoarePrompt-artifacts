Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer (>= 1) and represents the length of the list. The list contains integers (>= 1) and its length is equal to the first integer. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list 'a' contains elements that are the sum of the original elements and their 1-based index plus one, and 'n' remains unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list 'a' remains unchanged, 'n' remains unchanged, 'counter' contains the frequency of each element in the original list 'a' minus the number of times each element was appended to 'ans', 'cnt' is 0, and 'ans' contains all elements from the original list 'a' in descending order, with each element repeated a number of times equal to its frequency in the original list, and with all missing numbers between the elements of the original list 'a' inserted in descending order.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The list 'a' remains unchanged, 'n' remains unchanged, 'counter' contains the frequency of each element in the original list 'a' minus the number of times each element was appended to 'ans', 'cnt' is 0, and 'ans' contains all elements from the original list 'a' in descending order, with each element repeated a number of times equal to its frequency in the original list, with all missing numbers between the elements of the original list 'a' inserted in descending order, and with 'cnt' number of elements decremented by 1 appended at the end.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: All elements from the original list 'a' in descending order, with each element repeated a number of times equal to its frequency in the original list, with all missing numbers between the elements of the original list 'a' inserted in descending order, and with 'cnt' number of elements decremented by 1 appended at the end.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) representing the length of a list, followed by a list of integers. The function modifies the list by adding the 1-based index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then reconstructs the list by inserting missing numbers between the elements and repeating each element a number of times equal to its frequency in the original list. Finally, it appends any remaining missing numbers at the end of the list and prints the resulting list.
