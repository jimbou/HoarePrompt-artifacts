Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) representing the length of a list, followed by a list of integers. The function modifies the list by adding the 1-based index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then reconstructs the list by inserting missing numbers between the elements and repeating each element a number of times equal to its frequency in the original list. Finally, it appends any remaining missing numbers at the end of the list and prints the resulting list.**
