Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Since the list contains integers and its length is equal to `n`, `a` becomes a list of integers with a length equal to `n`. Stdin now contains one less test case. No other variables are affected.
