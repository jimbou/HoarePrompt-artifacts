Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, which is used in `func_2` to calculate the product of a list of integers.

`func_2` reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome, calculates the product of the multipliers using `func_1`, and then calculates the product of each multiplier with the overall product, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the overall product by each multiplier. If the result of the subtraction is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of products of each multiplier with the overall product, which represents the bets on the outcomes.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the product of the multipliers, which represents the total amount of coins that need to be distributed, and then calculates the bets on each outcome by multiplying the product with each multiplier and subtracting the sum of the integer divisions of the product by each multiplier. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
