Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, and it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. It then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and checks if the sum of these products is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the products as the bets for each outcome. If not, it prints -1.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the LCM of two numbers, which is correct. The main function `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and the products of the LCM and each multiplier.

However, the program does not handle the case where the sum of the products is equal to the LCM. In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. This is because the problem statement requires the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes to be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
