Reasoning:

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function 1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b, which is used in Function 2 to calculate the product of the multipliers.

Function 2 takes a list of integers vals and an integer N as input, where N is the length of vals. It calculates the product of the multipliers using Function 1 and then calculates the product of each multiplier with the overall product, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the overall product by each multiplier. If the result of the subtraction is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and ends. Otherwise, it prints the list of products of each multiplier with the overall product, separated by spaces.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. It calculates the product of the multipliers and then calculates the product of each multiplier with the overall product, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the overall product by each multiplier. If the result of the subtraction is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of products of each multiplier with the overall product, which represents the bets on each outcome.

Correctness: **True**
