Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, calculates the LCM of all the multipliers, and then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier. It then subtracts the sum of these products from the LCM to get the remaining amount. If the remaining amount is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the products, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
