This function calculates the product of a list of integers and then calculates the product of each integer in the list with the overall product, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the overall product by each integer in the list. If the result of the subtraction is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and ends. Otherwise, it prints the list of products of each integer in the list with the overall product, separated by spaces.
