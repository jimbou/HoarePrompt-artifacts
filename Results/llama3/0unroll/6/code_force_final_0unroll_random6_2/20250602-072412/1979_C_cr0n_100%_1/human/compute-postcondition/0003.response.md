Output State: **vals is a list of integers, N is an integer equal to the length of vals, vals contains integers greater than or equal to 2, den is an integer equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first two elements of vals, then func_1 applied to the result and the third element of vals, and so on, until the last element of vals, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the original den by each element in vals, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the list `vals` and its length `N` remain unchanged. The list `vals` still contains integers greater than or equal to 2. The variable `den` is updated by subtracting the sum of the integer divisions of the original `den` by each element in `vals`. This means that `den` now holds a new value that is the result of the original `den` minus the sum of these divisions. The stdin remains empty, as no input operations were performed.
