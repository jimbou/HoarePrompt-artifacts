Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is minimal. It then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier to determine the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The program also checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than or equal to 0, in which case it prints -1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, and the case where the multipliers are all different. It also correctly handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, in which case it simply prints the multiplier.

The program's use of the LCM to minimize the total amount of coins bet is a key insight that ensures the correctness of the solution. By using the LCM, the program ensures that the total amount of coins bet is minimal, which in turn ensures that the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, and it correctly handles all possible cases.
