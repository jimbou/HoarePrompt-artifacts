Postcondition: ***vals is a list of integers, N is an integer equal to the length of vals, vals contains integers greater than or equal to 2, den is an integer equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first two elements of vals, then func_1 applied to the result and the third element of vals, and so on, until the last element of vals, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the original den by each element in vals. The current value of den is less than or equal to 0. stdin contains no input.***
