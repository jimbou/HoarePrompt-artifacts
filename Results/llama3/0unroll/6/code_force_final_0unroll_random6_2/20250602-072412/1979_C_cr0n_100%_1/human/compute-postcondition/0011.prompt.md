You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vals is a list of integers, N is an integer such that N = len(vals) and vals contains integers greater than or equal to 2.
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: Output State: vals is a list of integers, N is an integer equal to the length of vals, vals contains integers greater than or equal to 2, den is an integer equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first two elements of vals, then func_1 applied to the result and the third element of vals, and so on, until the last element of vals, stdin contains no input.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The program simply ends without producing any output.
    #State: *vals is a list of integers, N is an integer equal to the length of vals, vals contains integers greater than or equal to 2, den is an integer equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first two elements of vals, then func_1 applied to the result and the third element of vals, and so on, until the last element of vals, minus the sum of the integer divisions of the original den by each element in vals, stdin contains no input. den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: the list of products of the elements in vals, where each product is calculated by multiplying the current product by the next element in vals, starting from the first element of vals, and the products are separated by spaces

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The program simply ends without producing any output.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
