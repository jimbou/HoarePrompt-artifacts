Functionality: **This function reads an integer input from the user, subtracts 1 from it, and then repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 minus 1 from the result until it reaches 0. It keeps track of the powers of 2 used in this process and stores them in a list. The function then generates a new list by concatenating a list of numbers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 used, with the list of powers of 2 used, excluding the first element. Finally, it prints the length of the new list and its elements in order.**
