Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is [3, 2, 1], mx is 3.**

The loop iterates until x becomes 0. In each iteration, it calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to x + 1, and appends this value to subseq_lens. It then subtracts 2 raised to the power of this value minus 1 from x, and updates mx if necessary. The loop breaks when x becomes 0.
