Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is [3, 2, 1], `mx` is 3, `ansv` is [0, 1, 2].**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains 0, and the list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged as [3, 2, 1]. The variable `mx` is still 3. A new variable `ansv` is introduced, which is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, i.e., [0, 1, 2].
