To determine what will be printed when the `print(len(ansv))` statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `x` is 0: This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `subseq_lens` is [3, 2, 1]: This list is also not used in the print statement, so its contents do not affect the output.
- `mx` is 3: Like `x` and `subseq_lens`, `mx` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not impact the output.
- `ansv` is [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]: This is the variable used in the print statement. The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a list.

Given that `ansv` contains 5 elements (0, 1, 2, 2, 1), the `len(ansv)` will return 5.

Therefore, when the `print(len(ansv))` statement executes, it will print the number of elements in the `ansv` list.

Output: **5**
