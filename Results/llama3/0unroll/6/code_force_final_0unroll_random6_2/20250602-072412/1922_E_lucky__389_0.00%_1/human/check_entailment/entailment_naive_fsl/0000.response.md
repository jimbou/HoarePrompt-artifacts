Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 1. According to the problem description, an empty subsequence is also increasing, so the program should be able to handle the case when X is 1. However, the program subtracts 1 from X at the beginning, which makes it impossible to handle the case when X is 1 correctly.

In this case, the program will output an empty array, which is not a valid solution according to the problem description. The correct output for X = 1 should be an array with a single element, for example, [0].

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when X is 1 correctly.
