Output State: **l is the index of the smallest element in array that is greater than or equal to find, r is the index of the largest element in array that is less than find.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable l now points to the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to the value of find. The variable r now points to the index of the largest element in the array that is less than the value of find. The array and n remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
