#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n and n is the length of array.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: l is the index of the smallest element in array that is greater than or equal to find, r is the index of the largest element in array that is less than find.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the second string is the index of 'find' in the array plus one. The index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to 'find' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is the index of the smallest element in array that is greater than or equal to find, r is the index of the largest element in array that is less than find, and l is not equal to the index of find in array, and 0 is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to a target value 'find'. If the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to 'find' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. Otherwise, it prints 0 and does not return any value.
