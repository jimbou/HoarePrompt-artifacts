Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
2.  Inside the loop, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`. It then reads the permutation `array` as a list of integers.
3.  The program calls the function `func_1` with the `array` and `x` as arguments. This function is supposed to find the number of operations required to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after applying the binary search algorithm, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
4.  The function `func_1` first initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until `l` is greater than `r`.
5.  Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to `x`. If it is, it updates `r` to `mid - 1`; otherwise, it updates `l` to `mid + 1`.
6.  After the loop, it checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. If it is not, it prints 1 (indicating that one operation is required) and returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` (the indices are 1-based). If the element at index `l` is equal to `x`, it prints 0 (indicating that no operations are required) and returns an empty list.
7.  The main program then prints the result returned by `func_1` if it is not empty.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

*   The function `func_1` does not actually perform the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Instead, it performs a modified binary search that finds the first element greater than or equal to `x`.
*   The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `x` is not found in the array. In this case, it will return incorrect results.
*   The program does not handle the case where the input array is not a permutation (i.e., it contains duplicate elements or elements outside the range 1 to `n`). In this case, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
