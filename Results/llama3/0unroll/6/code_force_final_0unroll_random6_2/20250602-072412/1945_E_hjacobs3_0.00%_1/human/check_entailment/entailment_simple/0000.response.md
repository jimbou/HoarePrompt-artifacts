Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the input array to find the index of the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the target value `find`. If the index of the smallest element is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, it means that `find` is not in its correct position in the sorted array. In this case, the function prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices of the smallest element and `find` in the array, which can be swapped to put `find` in its correct position.

If the index of the smallest element is equal to the index of `find` in the array, it means that `find` is already in its correct position in the sorted array, and the function prints 0.

The main program reads the input, calls `func_1`, and prints the result if it is not empty.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the cases where `find` is not in its correct position in the sorted array.

Correctness: **True**
