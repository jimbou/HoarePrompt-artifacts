Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program does not guarantee this condition.

A counterexample is when the input is:

5 1
3 5 4 2 1

The program will output:

2
2 4
1 5

However, after swapping the elements at positions 2 and 4, and then at positions 1 and 5, the permutation becomes:

1 4 5 2 3

The binary search algorithm will then be executed, but it will not find the element 1 at position l, because the permutation is not sorted.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input, and the correctness is **False**.
