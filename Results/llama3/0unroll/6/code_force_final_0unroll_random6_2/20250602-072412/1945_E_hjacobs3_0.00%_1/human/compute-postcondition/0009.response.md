Functionality: **This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to a target value 'find'. If the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to 'find' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. Otherwise, it prints 0 and does not return any value.**
