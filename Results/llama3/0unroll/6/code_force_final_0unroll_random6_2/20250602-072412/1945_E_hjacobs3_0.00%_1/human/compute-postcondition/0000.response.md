Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of the `array`, which is the number of elements in the list. The values of `l` and `r` have been assigned to be 0 and `n - 1`, respectively, which are the indices of the first and last elements of the `array`. The `array` itself remains unchanged, still containing a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. The value of `find` is not affected by the code and remains an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
