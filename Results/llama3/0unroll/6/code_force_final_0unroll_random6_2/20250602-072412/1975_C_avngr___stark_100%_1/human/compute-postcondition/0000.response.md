The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, the value of `t` will be the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
