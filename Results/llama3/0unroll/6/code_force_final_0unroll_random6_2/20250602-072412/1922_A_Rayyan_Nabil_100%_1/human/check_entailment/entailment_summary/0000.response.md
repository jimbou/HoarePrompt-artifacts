Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 takes four parameters: n, a, b, and c, where n is the length of the strings a, b, and c. It iterates over the characters of the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where both a and b differ from c, it immediately returns 'YES'. If it doesn't find such a position after iterating over all characters, it returns 'NO'.

Function func_2 is the main function that accepts the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it accepts the length of the strings n and the strings a, b, and c. It then calls func_1 with these parameters and appends the result to the results list. Finally, it prints each result in the results list.

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic. The function func_1 correctly checks if there exists a position where both a and b differ from c, which is the condition for the strings a and b to match the template t while the string c does not. The function func_2 correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
