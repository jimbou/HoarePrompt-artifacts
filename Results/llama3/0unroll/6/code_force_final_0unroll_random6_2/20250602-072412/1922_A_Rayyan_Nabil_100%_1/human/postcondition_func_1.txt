The function accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function then appends the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) to the results list for each test case. Finally, it prints each result in the results list to the console. The function does not modify the input variables t, n, a, b, c, or the stdin.
