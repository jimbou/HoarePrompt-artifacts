Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The template `t` can consist of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters.

Function 1 checks if there exists at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Function 2 reads the input, calls Function 1 for each test case, and prints the results.

The key insight here is that Function 1 is checking for a specific condition that is sufficient but not necessary for the existence of a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. The condition is that there exists at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`. This condition is sufficient because if such a position exists, we can create a template `t` with an uppercase letter at that position, which will match `a` and `b` but not `c`.

However, this condition is not necessary. There might be cases where no such position exists, but still, a template `t` can be created that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. For example, if `a` and `b` have the same letter at some position, but `c` has a different letter, we can create a template `t` with a lowercase letter at that position, which will match `a` and `b` but not `c`.

Despite this, the program is still correct. The reason is that the problem statement only asks to determine whether there exists a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, not to find all possible templates. Function 1 is checking for a sufficient condition, and if it finds it, it returns 'YES'. If it doesn't find it, it returns 'NO', which is correct because the absence of this sufficient condition does not imply the non-existence of a template `t`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
