Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: The loop will return 'YES' if there exists at least one position i where a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i]. If no such position is found after checking all n positions, the loop will finish without returning anything, leaving the state unchanged.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Overall this is what the function does:The function compares two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` with a third string `c` of the same length, and returns 'YES' if there exists at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of a, b, c is equal to n.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: t is an integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of a, b, c is equal to n, results is a list of t elements, each element is the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) for each iteration of the loop, stdin is empty.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "result" has taken on the value of each element in the list "results" in sequence, and the print function has been called for each element in "results", printing each result to the console. The values of the other variables (t, n, a, b, c, results, stdin) remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function then appends the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) to the results list for each test case. Finally, it prints each result in the results list to the console. The function does not modify the input variables t, n, a, b, c, or the stdin.
