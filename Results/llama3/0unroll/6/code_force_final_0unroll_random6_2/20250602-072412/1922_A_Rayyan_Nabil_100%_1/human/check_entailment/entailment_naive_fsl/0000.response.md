Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. It does this by iterating over the characters of the strings and checking if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different from the character at the same position in `c`. If it finds such a position, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template `t` exists. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO', indicating that no template `t` exists.

The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including the examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
