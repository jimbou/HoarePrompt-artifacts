Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases according to the problem description. 

The program first checks if the input number `n` is odd. If it is, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters. 

If `n` is even, the program creates a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This string has exactly `n` special characters. The program then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and the string `s`. If the length of `s` is not less than 200, the program prints 'NO'. 

However, since `n` is at most 50, the length of `s` will always be less than 200. Therefore, the program will always print 'YES' and the string `s` when `n` is even. 

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output according to the problem description.
