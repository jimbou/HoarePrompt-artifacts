Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each subsequent integer n, the function checks if n is even and if the length of the string 'AAB' repeated n/2 times is less than 200. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by the repeated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process t times, providing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses along with the corresponding strings.**
