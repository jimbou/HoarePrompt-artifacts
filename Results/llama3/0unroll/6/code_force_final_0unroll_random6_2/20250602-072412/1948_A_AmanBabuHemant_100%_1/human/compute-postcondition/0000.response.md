The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers n (1 <= n <= 50). The first input is assigned to t. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since one input is accepted from stdin, it now contains t integers n (1 <= n <= 50). 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t integers n (1 <= n <= 50)**
