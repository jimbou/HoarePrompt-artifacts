Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated a certain number of times, depending on the input values. The number of responses is equal to the initial value of t. For each input value n, if n is even, the response is 'YES' followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated n/2 times, as long as the length of the string is less than 200. If n is odd or the length of the string is 200 or more, the response is 'NO'.**
