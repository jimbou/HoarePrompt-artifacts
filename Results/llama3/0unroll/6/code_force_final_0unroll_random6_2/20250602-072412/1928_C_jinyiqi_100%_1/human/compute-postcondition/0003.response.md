Output State: **x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0, output1 is a list of divisors of the first integer in x in reverse order, output2 is a list of corresponding quotients of the first integer in x.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of divisors of the first integer in x (output1) has been reversed, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list of corresponding quotients of the first integer in x (output2) remains the same. The original relationship between the two integers in x is still valid, i.e., the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0.
