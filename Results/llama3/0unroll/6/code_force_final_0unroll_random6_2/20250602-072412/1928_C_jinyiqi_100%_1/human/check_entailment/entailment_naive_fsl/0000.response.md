Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0 and (n - x) % 2 == 0. This is because the settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions, and we need to find the possible values of k that satisfy the given constraints.

2. The program then uses the func_1 function to find all the factors of (n + x - 2) and (n - x). The func_1 function correctly finds all the factors of a given number.

3. The program then checks if the factors satisfy the condition (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x. This is because k must be greater than or equal to x, and k must be an even number.

4. The program then adds the satisfying factors to the output list and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.

5. Finally, the program prints the length of the output list, which represents the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
