    #State: Output State: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0, output1 is a list of divisors of the first integer in x, output2 is a list of corresponding quotients of the first integer in x.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a combined list of corresponding quotients of the first integer in x and divisors of the first integer in x in reverse order. The first integer in x is greater than the second integer in x and both integers are greater than 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0. It calculates the divisors and corresponding quotients of the first integer, and returns a combined list of these quotients and divisors in reverse order. The original list remains unchanged.
