Reasoning: 
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program seems to be checking for the presence of integers in two sets, `a` and `b`, and determining the outcome based on certain conditions. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query.

The program does not iterate over the queries and does not check the conditions for each query. It also does not output the correct format of `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Correctness: **False**
