Output State: **The output state is a list of strings, where each string is either 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S'. The strings are determined by the values of f, m, and n after the loop finishes executing. If f is 1 and m or n is less than 0, the string is 'N'. If f is 0, the string is 'Y'. If f is 1 and m and n are both non-negative, the string is 'E'. If f is 0 and m or n is less than 0, the string is 'O'. If f is 0 and m and n are both non-negative, the string is 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state is a list of strings that indicate the result of the loop's execution. The strings can be 'Y' (yes), 'N' (no), 'E' (error), 'O' (overflow), or 'S' (success). The result depends on the values of the variables f, m, and n after the loop finishes executing.
