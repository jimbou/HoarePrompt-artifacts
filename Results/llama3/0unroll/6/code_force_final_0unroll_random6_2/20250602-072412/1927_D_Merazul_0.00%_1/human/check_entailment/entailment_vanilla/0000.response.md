Reasoning:

The given Python program is attempting to solve the problem described, but it is not correct. Here's why:

1. The program is using a very dense and unclear coding style, which makes it hard to understand what the code is doing. This is not a good practice, especially in a programming contest where readability is important.

2. The program is using a lot of single-letter variable names, which makes it hard to understand what these variables represent. This is not a good practice, as it makes the code hard to read and understand.

3. The program is using a lot of bitwise operations, which is not necessary for this problem. This makes the code hard to understand and may lead to errors.

4. The program is not correctly solving the problem. The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j`. However, the program is not correctly implementing this logic.

5. The program is not handling the case where `l == r` correctly. In this case, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

6. The program is not handling the case where `a_l == a_r` correctly. In this case, the program should output `l r` because `l` and `r` are two different indices that satisfy the condition.

7. The program is not handling the case where `a_l != a_r` correctly. In this case, the program should output `l r` because `l` and `r` are two different indices that satisfy the condition.

8. The program is not correctly handling the queries. The program is only considering the first query and ignoring the rest of the queries.

9. The program is not correctly printing the output. The program is printing `YNEOS` instead of the correct output.

10. The program is not correctly handling the case where the input is invalid. The program is not checking if the input is valid and is not handling the case where the input is invalid.

Correctness: **False**
