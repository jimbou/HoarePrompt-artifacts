This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer, a list of integers, another integer, and a list of pairs of integers. It then processes each test case, determining whether certain conditions are met based on the presence of integers in the lists and their relationships. The function outputs a list of strings, where each string represents the result of the conditions evaluated for each test case, with possible values being 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S', indicating different outcomes based on the conditions met.
