#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers.
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: The output state is a list of strings, where each string is either 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S'. The strings are determined by the values of f, m, and n after the loop finishes executing. If f is 1 and m or n is less than 0, the string is 'N'. If f is 0, the string is 'Y'. If f is 1 and m and n are both non-negative, the string is 'E'. If f is 0 and m or n is less than 0, the string is 'O'. If f is 0 and m and n are both non-negative, the string is 'S'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer, a list of integers, another integer, and a list of pairs of integers. It then processes each test case, determining whether certain conditions are met based on the presence of integers in the lists and their relationships. The function outputs a list of strings, where each string represents the result of the conditions evaluated for each test case, with possible values being 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S', indicating different outcomes based on the conditions met.
