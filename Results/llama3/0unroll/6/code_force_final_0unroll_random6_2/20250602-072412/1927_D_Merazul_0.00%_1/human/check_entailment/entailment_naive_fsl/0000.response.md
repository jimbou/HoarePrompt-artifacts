Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses a set to store the elements of the array a, which loses the information about the indices of the elements. Then, it uses another set to store the queries, which is not necessary. The program then tries to find a pair of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r, but it does not correctly implement this logic.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program will output:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple pairs of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r. It only finds one pair and returns it, but it does not check if there are other pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
