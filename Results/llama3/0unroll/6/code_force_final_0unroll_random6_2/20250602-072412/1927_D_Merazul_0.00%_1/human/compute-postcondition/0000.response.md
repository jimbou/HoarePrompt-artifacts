Output State: **t is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The integer is a non-negative integer. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. Then, it reads the first input, a non-negative integer, into the variable `t`. This consumes the first input from stdin, leaving the remaining test cases intact. The state of `t` is updated to the value of the first input, and stdin now contains one fewer test case.
