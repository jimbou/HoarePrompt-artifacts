Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a clever trick with bitwise operations and string indexing. However, the program is not correctly solving the problem.

The main issue with the program is that it is not correctly identifying the pairs of different elements within the given range. The program is using a set `a` to store the elements of the array, and a set `b` to store the query boundaries. However, the program is not correctly iterating over the elements of the array and the query boundaries to find the pairs of different elements.

Moreover, the program is using a complex and convoluted logic to determine the output string, which is not clearly related to the problem statement. The program is using bitwise operations and string indexing to determine the output string, which is not a clear or efficient way to solve the problem.

Therefore, the given program is not correctly solving the problem, and the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
