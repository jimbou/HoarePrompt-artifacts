Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers.**
