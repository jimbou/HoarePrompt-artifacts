Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a and b) of lengths n and m respectively. It then calculates and prints the number of times a subarray of length m with at least k common elements with the array b can be found in the array a, for each test case. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results in the order they were input.**
