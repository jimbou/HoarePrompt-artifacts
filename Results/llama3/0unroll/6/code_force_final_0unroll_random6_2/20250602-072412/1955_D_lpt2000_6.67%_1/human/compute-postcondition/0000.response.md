Output State: **`nabors` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of `nabors`. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively. 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `nabors` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, with each test case still consisting of three integers and two lists of integers with specific constraints on their lengths and values.
