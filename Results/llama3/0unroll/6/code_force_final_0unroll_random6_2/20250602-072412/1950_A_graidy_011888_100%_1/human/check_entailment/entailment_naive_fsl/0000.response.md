Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three input digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the digits are equal (e.g., 0 0 0) or where the digits are in decreasing order (e.g., 3 2 1). The program also handles cases where the digits are in increasing order but not strictly increasing (e.g., 1 2 2).

The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
