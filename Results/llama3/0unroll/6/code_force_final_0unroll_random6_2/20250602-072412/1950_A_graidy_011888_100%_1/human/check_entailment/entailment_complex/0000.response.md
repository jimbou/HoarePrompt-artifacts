Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads an integer `t` from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. This matches the problem description.

2. The program then reads `t` lines of input, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. This also matches the problem description.

3. The program classifies each triplet as 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, or 'NONE' otherwise. This matches the problem description.

4. The program prints the corresponding classification for each triplet to standard output. This matches the problem description.

5. The program does not modify the input values or return any values, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (in which case it prints 'NONE').

7. The program's output matches the example output provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
