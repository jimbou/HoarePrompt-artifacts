Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program's logic matches the problem description, and the execution summary confirms that it behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
