    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer d as input, modifies the list by incrementing certain elements, and returns the last element of the modified list. Specifically, it increments the first d-1 elements by 2, and then for each element at index i (where i is greater than or equal to d), it increments the element by the value of the smallest element in the previous d+2 elements plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers with n rows and m columns, and d is less than or equal to m.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable total_costs is now a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of k consecutive integers from the list costs. The variables n, m, k, d, and rows remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the smallest sum of k consecutive integers from the list costs

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive integers from a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a separate function (func_1) applied to each row of a 2D list of non-negative integers, with the row index and a given integer d as inputs. The function takes no arguments, reads input from the user, and prints the minimum sum. The input variables n, m, k, d, and rows remain unchanged.
