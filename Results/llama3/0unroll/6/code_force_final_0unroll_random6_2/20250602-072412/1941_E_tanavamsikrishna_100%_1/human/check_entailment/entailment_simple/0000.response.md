Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a combination of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance `d` between supports as input. It modifies the row by incrementing the elements at indices 1 to `d-1` by 2, and then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of installing supports for the remaining elements in the row. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

`func_2` takes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports as input. It reads the river depths from the input and stores them in a 2D list `rows`. Then, it applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for each row. The function then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores them in the list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost from the list `total_costs`.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses efficient data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
