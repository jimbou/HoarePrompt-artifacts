Functionality: **Calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive integers from a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a separate function (func_1) applied to each row of a 2D list of non-negative integers, with the row index and a given integer d as inputs. The function takes no arguments, reads input from the user, and prints the minimum sum. The input variables n, m, k, d, and rows remain unchanged.**
