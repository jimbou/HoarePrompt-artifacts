Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Function `func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `d` as input, modifies the list by incrementing certain elements, and returns the last element of the modified list. This function is used to calculate the cost of installing supports for a single bridge.

Function `func_2` calculates the minimum sum of `k` consecutive integers from a list of costs, where each cost is determined by `func_1` applied to each row of a 2D list of non-negative integers, with the row index and a given integer `d` as inputs. This function takes no arguments, reads input from the user, and prints the minimum sum.

The program correctly implements the problem description by:

1. Reading the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the user.
2. Reading the 2D list of non-negative integers `rows` from the user.
3. Calculating the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
4. Calculating the minimum sum of `k` consecutive integers from the list of costs.
5. Printing the minimum sum.

The program correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as the distance between supports being no more than `d`, and the supports being installed on the river banks.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
