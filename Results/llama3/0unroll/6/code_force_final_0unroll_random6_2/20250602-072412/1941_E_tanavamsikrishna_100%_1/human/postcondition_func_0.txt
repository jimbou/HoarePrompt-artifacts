This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer d as input, modifies the list by incrementing certain elements, and returns the last element of the modified list. Specifically, it increments the first d-1 elements by 2, and then for each element at index i (where i is greater than or equal to d), it increments the element by the value of the smallest element in the previous d+2 elements plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list.
