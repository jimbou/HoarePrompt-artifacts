Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers with n rows and m columns, d is less than or equal to m, costs is a list of integers, and total_costs is an empty list.**

The first line of the code assigns the values of four positive integers from stdin to the variables n, m, k, and d. The second line creates a 2D list of non-negative integers, rows, with n rows and m columns, by reading n lines of input from stdin. The third line calculates the costs of each row in rows using the function func_1 and stores the results in the list costs. The fourth line initializes an empty list, total_costs. 

Note that the function func_1 is not defined in the given code snippet, so its exact behavior is unknown. However, based on its usage, it appears to take a row and d as input and return an integer cost.
