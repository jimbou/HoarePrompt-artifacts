Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. This line is trying to update the cost of the current cell `i` by adding the cost of the previous cell `e[0]` and the current cell `row[i]`, and then adding 1. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the cost.

The correct way to calculate the cost is to find the minimum cost of the previous cells that are within the distance `d` and add the cost of the current cell. The program is not correctly implementing this logic.

For example, consider the input:

```
1 8 1 1
0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
```

The program will output `15`, but the correct output is `14`. The correct solution would be to place supports at cells `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(1, 6)`, and `(1, 8)`, which would cost `10 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 20`. However, the program is not correctly calculating this cost.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
