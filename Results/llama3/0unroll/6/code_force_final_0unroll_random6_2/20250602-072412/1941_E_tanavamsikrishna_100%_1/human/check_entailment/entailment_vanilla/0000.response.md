Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a combination of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for the previous `d` cells. The function returns the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

`func_2` reads the input data, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance between supports `d`. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. The function then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the problem's constraints and requirements. It ensures that a support must be installed in the first and last cells of each row, and that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. The program also correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

However, there is a small mistake in the `func_1` function. In the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`, the `+ 1` is incorrect. The correct line should be `row[i] = e[0] + row[i]`. This is because the cost of installing a support in a cell is the depth of the cell plus 1, not plus 2.

Correctness: **False**
