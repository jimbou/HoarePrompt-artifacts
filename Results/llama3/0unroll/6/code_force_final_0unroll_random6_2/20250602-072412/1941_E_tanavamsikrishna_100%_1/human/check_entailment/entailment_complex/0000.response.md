Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a non-negative integer `d` as input. It modifies the list by incrementing certain elements and returns the last element of the modified list. The function correctly implements the logic of installing supports in a row, considering the distance constraint `d`.

`func_2` reads input from the user, including the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`. It then applies `func_1` to each row of the input 2D list `rows` to calculate the costs of installing supports for each row. The function correctly calculates the minimum sum of `k` consecutive integers from the list of costs.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements, and the functions work together to produce the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
