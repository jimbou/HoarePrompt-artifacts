Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and the list of integers `p_i`.
* It initializes a list `v` with `n+1` elements, where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
* The program then checks for each friend `i` if their best friend `v[i]` has `i` as their best friend, i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`. This is the condition for two friends to come to the party.
* If such a pair of friends is found, the program prints 2 and returns, as this is the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party.
* If no such pair is found after checking all friends, the program prints 3, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party in the worst-case scenario.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
