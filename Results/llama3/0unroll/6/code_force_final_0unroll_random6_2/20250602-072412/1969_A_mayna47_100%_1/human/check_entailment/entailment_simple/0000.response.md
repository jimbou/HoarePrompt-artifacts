Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program iterates through the list of friends and checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., v[v[i]] == i). If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program's logic is correct because it covers all possible scenarios:

1. If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, sending invitations to these two friends is sufficient to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. If there is no such pair, it is impossible to have only 2 friends come to the party, as each friend's best friend must also receive an invitation. In this case, sending invitations to at least three friends is necessary to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send.

Correctness: **True**
