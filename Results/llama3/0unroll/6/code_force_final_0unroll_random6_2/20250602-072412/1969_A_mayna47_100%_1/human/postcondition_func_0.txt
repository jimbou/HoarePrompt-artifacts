This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, then checks if there exists a pair of elements in the list that are swapped with each other. If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and terminates. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input list or the value of n.
