Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`.

2. The program correctly checks for pairs of friends that are each other's best friends: It iterates over the list of best friends and checks if `v[v[i]] == i` for each `i`. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 and terminates.

3. The program correctly handles the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends: If the loop completes without finding a pair, it prints 3.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It checks for the optimal solution (sending invitations to 2 friends) and falls back to the next best solution (sending invitations to 3 friends) if the optimal solution is not possible.

Correctness: **True**
