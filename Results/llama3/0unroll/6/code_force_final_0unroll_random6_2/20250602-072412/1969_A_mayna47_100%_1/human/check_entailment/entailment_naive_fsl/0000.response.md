Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. 

The program first checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because sending invitations to these two friends will result in both of them attending the party.

If no such pair is found, it means that each friend's best friend is not their own best friend. In this case, the program prints 3, because sending invitations to three friends will guarantee that at least two of them will attend the party.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It checks for the optimal solution (2 invitations) first, and if that's not possible, it falls back to the next best solution (3 invitations). The program does not miss any potential cases, and it does not contain any logical errors. Therefore, the program is correct.
