Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 2 and 50 inclusive. Then, it creates a list `v` of `n+1` zeros. The next line reads `n` distinct integers from stdin, which are between 1 and `n` inclusive and not equal to their 1-based index, and assigns them to the list `v`, starting from the second element (index 1). The first element of `v` remains 0. After executing the code, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers with the specified properties, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
