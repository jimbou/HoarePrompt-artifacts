Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game.

The key insight is that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array `c`, which means she wants to include as many small numbers as possible. However, Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to remove the smallest numbers from the array `a`.

The program uses a frequency count `cnt` to keep track of the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the frequency count.

If a number `i` has a frequency count of 1, it means that Alice can include it in her array `c` and Bob cannot remove it. Therefore, Alice can increase her MEX by 1.

If a number `i` has a frequency count of 0, it means that Bob has already removed it from the array `a`, so Alice cannot include it in her array `c`.

The program prints the smallest number `i` that satisfies either of the following conditions:

* `t >= 2`, which means that Alice has already included two numbers in her array `c` and Bob cannot remove them.
* `cnt[i] == 0`, which means that Bob has already removed the number `i` from the array `a`.

This strategy ensures that Alice maximizes her MEX, which is the smallest number that does not appear in her array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
