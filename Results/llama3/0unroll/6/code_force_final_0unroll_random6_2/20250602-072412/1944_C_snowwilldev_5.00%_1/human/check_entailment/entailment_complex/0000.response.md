Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `N` followed by a list of `N` integers.

2. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a dictionary `cnt`.

3. The program then iterates over the range of possible integers (from 0 to `N-1`) and checks the count of each integer.

4. If it finds an integer that appears either zero or two or more times, it prints that integer and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the list `c` will be the smallest such integer.

5. If no such integer is found, the program will print the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the list. This is because if all integers appear either zero or one time, the MEX will be the smallest integer that appears exactly once.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the input list is empty or contains only one element.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate elements.

8. The time complexity of the program is O(N), where N is the size of the input list. This is because the program iterates over the input list twice: once to count the occurrences of each integer, and once to find the smallest integer that appears either zero or two or more times.

9. The space complexity of the program is also O(N), because the program uses a dictionary to store the counts of each integer.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
