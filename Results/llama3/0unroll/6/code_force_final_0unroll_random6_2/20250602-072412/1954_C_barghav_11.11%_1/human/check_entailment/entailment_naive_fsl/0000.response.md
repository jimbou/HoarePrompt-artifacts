Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input numbers have different lengths. The program assumes that the input numbers have the same length, but it does not check for this condition. If the input numbers have different lengths, the program will throw an error when trying to access an index that is out of range.

For example, if the input is:

```
1
123
4567
```

The program will throw an error when trying to access the 4th index of the first number, because it only has 3 digits.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the input numbers have the same length before trying to swap their digits. If they have different lengths, the program should either pad the shorter number with zeros or handle the case in a different way, depending on the problem requirements.
