Functionality: **This function takes two pairs of integers as input, where each pair consists of two strings of the same length containing digits from 1 to 9. It then swaps the digits in the first half of each pair to be the maximum of the corresponding digits, and the digits in the second half to be the minimum of the corresponding digits. The function prints the modified first pair of integers, followed by the modified second pair of integers.**
