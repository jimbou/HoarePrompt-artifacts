The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).**
