Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the program handles the input string. The program assumes that the input string is a list of integers, but the problem description states that the input string is a binary string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s.

In the function `func_1()`, the program uses `map(int, input().split())` to read the input string, which will not work correctly if the input string contains only 0-s and/or 1-s without spaces. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will treat it as a single integer 101, not as a binary string.

To fix this issue, the program should read the input string as a string, not as a list of integers. The correct way to read the input string is by using `input()` function without `map(int, ...)` and `split()`.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

In this corrected implementation, the input string is read as a string using `input()` function, and then the program iterates over the characters of the string using a for loop.
