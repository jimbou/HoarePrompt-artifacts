Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 reads a binary string from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and then iterates over the list. For each '1' encountered, it increments a counter `n`. When a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, it means a sequence of '1's has ended, and the length of this sequence plus the number of '1's in it is added to the answer `ans`. This is because a cyclic shift operation can be performed on this sequence to move all '1's to the beginning of the sequence, and the cost of this operation is the length of the sequence.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then calls Function 1 for each test case.

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The program iterates over the binary string, identifies sequences of '1's, and calculates the cost of performing a cyclic shift operation on each sequence. The total cost is then printed as the output.

Correctness: **True**
