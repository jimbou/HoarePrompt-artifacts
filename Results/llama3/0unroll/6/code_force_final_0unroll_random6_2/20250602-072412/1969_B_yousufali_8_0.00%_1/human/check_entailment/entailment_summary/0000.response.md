Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1` reads a binary string from standard input, calculates the sum of the lengths of all sequences of 1s plus the total number of 1s, and prints the result. This function seems to be calculating the minimum cost to make the string sorted.

Function `func_2` reads a specified number of binary strings from standard input and processes each one using `func_1`. This function is the main entry point of the program and is responsible for handling multiple test cases.

The execution summaries suggest that `func_1` is correctly calculating the minimum cost for a single binary string, and `func_2` is correctly handling multiple test cases.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `func_1` is not correctly calculating the minimum cost. The function is adding the length of each sequence of 1s plus the total number of 1s, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The correct approach would be to find the longest sequence of 0s and 1s in the string and calculate the minimum cost based on that.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
