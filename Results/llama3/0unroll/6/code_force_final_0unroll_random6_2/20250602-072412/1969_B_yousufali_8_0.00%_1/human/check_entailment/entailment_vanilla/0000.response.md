Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string as input, converts it into a list of integers, and initializes two variables: `n` to keep track of the number of consecutive 1's and `ans` to store the total cost.

The function then iterates through the list of integers. If it encounters a 1, it increments `n`. If it encounters a 0 and `n` is not zero, it means that there is a sequence of 1's that needs to be shifted to the right. In this case, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`, which represents the cost of shifting the sequence of 1's.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls Function 1.

However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the provided code. The problem description states that the input is a binary string, but the code reads the input as a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This would work if the input was a list of space-separated integers, but it would not work correctly for a binary string.

Moreover, the code does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted. In this case, the function should print 0, but the current implementation would print a non-zero value.

Therefore, the provided code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
