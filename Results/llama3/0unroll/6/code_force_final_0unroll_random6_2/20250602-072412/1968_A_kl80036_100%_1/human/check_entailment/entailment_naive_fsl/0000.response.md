Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 2, the program outputs 1, but the correct output should be any number that satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. In this case, the correct output should be 1, but the program does not check if gcd(2, 1) + 1 is indeed the maximum possible value.

A correct program should iterate through all possible values of y from 1 to x-1 and find the value that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_sum = 0
        max_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            gcd = math.gcd(x, y)
            if gcd + y > max_sum:
                max_sum = gcd + y
                max_y = y
        print(max_y)
```
This program correctly finds the value of y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y for each input x.
