Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply subtracts 1 from each input integer x and prints the result as y.

The key observation here is that gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. So, gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x, which is indeed the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y.

Since the program correctly identifies y as x-1 for each input x, and this choice of y maximizes gcd(x, y) + y, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
