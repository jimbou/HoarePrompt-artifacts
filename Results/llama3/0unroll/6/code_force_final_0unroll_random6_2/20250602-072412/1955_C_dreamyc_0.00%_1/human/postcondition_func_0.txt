This function reduces the values of elements in a deque of positive integers by a certain amount 'x' until a specified number 'k' is exhausted or the deque has less than 2 elements. It then returns the number of elements that were completely removed from the deque. If 'k' is not exhausted and the deque has only 1 element that is less than or equal to 'k', it also removes that element and increments the count of removed elements. The function effectively reduces the values of elements in the deque and counts the number of elements that are completely removed.
