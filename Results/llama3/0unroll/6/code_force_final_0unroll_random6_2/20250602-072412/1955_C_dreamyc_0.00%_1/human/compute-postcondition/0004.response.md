Postcondition: ***k is 0 or len(nums) is less than 2, nums is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, ans is the number of elements that were completely removed from nums. Additionally, the following condition is false: (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])), meaning that either k is 0, or len(nums) is not 1, or k is less than nums[0].***
