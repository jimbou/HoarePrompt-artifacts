Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue data structure. This means that `nums` is now a deque of `n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer. The second line initializes a new variable `ans` to 0.

The initial state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The only change is that `nums` is now a deque instead of a list, and a new variable `ans` is introduced with a value of 0.
