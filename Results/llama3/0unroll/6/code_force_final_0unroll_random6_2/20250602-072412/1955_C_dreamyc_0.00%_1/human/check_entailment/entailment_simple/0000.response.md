Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships and counts the number of ships that sink.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `k`, and `nums`.
2. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes `n`, `k`, and `nums` as input.
3. Inside the function, it initializes a deque `nums` with the input list `nums` and sets `ans` to 0.
4. The program then enters a while loop that continues until `k` is 0 or the length of `nums` is less than 2.
5. Inside the loop, it pops the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively.
6. It then calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to `x`.
7. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it subtracts `x` from both `a` and `b` and subtracts `2 * x` from `k`. This simulates the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships.
8. If `a` or `b` becomes 0, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that a ship has sunk.
9. If `a` or `b` is still greater than 0, it appends them back to the deque `nums`.
10. After the while loop, the program checks if `k` is not 0 and the length of `nums` is 1, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the only element in `nums`. If this condition is true, it returns `ans + 1`, indicating that the last ship has sunk.
11. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of ships that have sunk.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
