You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers.
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: k is 0 or len(nums) is less than 2, nums is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, ans is the number of elements that were completely removed from nums.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the number of elements that were completely removed from 'nums' plus 1, where 'nums' is a deque of 1 positive integer with some elements reduced by 'x', and 'k' is not 0 and is greater than or equal to the current value of the only element in 'nums'.
    #State: *k is 0 or len(nums) is less than 2, nums is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, ans is the number of elements that were completely removed from nums. Additionally, the following condition is false: (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])), meaning that either k is 0, or len(nums) is not 1, or k is less than nums[0].
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements that were completely removed from the deque 'nums', where 'nums' is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, and either k is 0, or the length of 'nums' is not 1, or k is less than the first element of 'nums'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of elements that were completely removed from 'nums' plus 1, where 'nums' is a deque of 1 positive integer with some elements reduced by 'x', and 'k' is not 0 and is greater than or equal to the current value of the only element in 'nums'.

Case_2: The program returns the number of elements that were completely removed from the deque 'nums', where 'nums' is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, and either k is 0, or the length of 'nums' is not 1, or k is less than the first element of 'nums'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
