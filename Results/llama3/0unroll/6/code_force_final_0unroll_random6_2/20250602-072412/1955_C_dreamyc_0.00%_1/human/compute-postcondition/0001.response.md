Output State: **k is 0 or len(nums) is less than 2, nums is a deque of n positive integers with some elements reduced by x, ans is the number of elements that were completely removed from nums.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of k is either 0 or the length of the deque nums is less than 2. The deque nums contains the same number of elements as initially, but some of these elements have been reduced by a certain value x. The variable ans now holds the count of elements that were completely removed from nums during the loop's execution.
