Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and counts the number of ships that are sunk.

The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add elements from both ends, simulating the Kraken's attack on the first and last ships. It also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack exhausts the durability of a ship, removing it from the deque and incrementing the count of sunk ships.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there is only one ship left or when the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink any ships.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reducing the values of elements in the deque and counting the number of elements that are completely removed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
