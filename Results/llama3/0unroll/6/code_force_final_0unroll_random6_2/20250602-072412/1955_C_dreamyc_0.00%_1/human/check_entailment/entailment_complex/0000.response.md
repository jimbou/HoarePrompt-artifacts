Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and counts the number of ships that are sunk. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add elements from the front and back of the queue, which represents the ships. The program also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink all the ships.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of a deque is efficient, and the program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of ships. The program's space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the ships' durability values.

The program's comments and variable names are clear and concise, making it easy to understand the program's logic and intent. The program's structure is also well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between the main function and the helper function.

Overall, the program is well-written, efficient, and correct.

Correctness: **True**
