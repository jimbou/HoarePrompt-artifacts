The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, and `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, the new value of `ans` is the minimum of the previous minimum length and the length of the last subarray.

Output State: **The value of `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`.**
