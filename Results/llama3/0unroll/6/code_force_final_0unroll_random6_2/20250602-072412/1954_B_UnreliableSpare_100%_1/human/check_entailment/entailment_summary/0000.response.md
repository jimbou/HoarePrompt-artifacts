Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. If the elements are not all equal, it then iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. 

3. It keeps updating the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found so far.

4. Finally, it prints the minimum count found, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge case where all elements are equal. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
