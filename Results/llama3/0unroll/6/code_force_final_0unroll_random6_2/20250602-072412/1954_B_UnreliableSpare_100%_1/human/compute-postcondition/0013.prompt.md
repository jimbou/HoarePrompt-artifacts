You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The value of ans is the minimum length of a subarray in arr with all elements equal to val, and the value of cnt is the length of the last subarray in arr with all elements equal to val.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`
    #State: The value of `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is True, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is `ans`, is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The value of `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`. The current value of `flag` is True, and -1 is being printed

Case_2: The value of `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, and `flag` is false, and the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val` which is ans is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
