Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.

3. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

4. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `ans` to infinity and a variable `cnt` to 0. It also sets a variable `val` to the first element of the array.

5. The program then iterates over the array. If the current element is the same as `val`, it increments `cnt`. If the current element is different from `val`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

6. After iterating over the entire array, it updates `ans` one more time to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

7. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
