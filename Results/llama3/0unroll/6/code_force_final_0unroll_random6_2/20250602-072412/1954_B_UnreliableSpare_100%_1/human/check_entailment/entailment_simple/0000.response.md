Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, it prints -1 as it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. If the array has different elements, it finds the minimum length of a subarray with all elements equal to the first element of the array. This minimum length is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first checks for the case where all elements are the same and handles it correctly. Then, it finds the minimum length of a subarray with all elements equal to the first element, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `ans` is initialized with `Decimal('Infinity')`, but it is not necessary to use the `Decimal` class here. A simple `float('inf')` would be sufficient. Also, the variable `val` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, but it is not used anywhere in the program. It can be removed.

Correctness: **True**
