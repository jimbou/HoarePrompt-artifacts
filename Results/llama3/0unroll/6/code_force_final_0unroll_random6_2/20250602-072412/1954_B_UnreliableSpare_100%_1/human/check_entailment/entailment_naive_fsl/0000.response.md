Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The program will return 1, but the correct answer is 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.

The issue is that the program only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle this case correctly.
