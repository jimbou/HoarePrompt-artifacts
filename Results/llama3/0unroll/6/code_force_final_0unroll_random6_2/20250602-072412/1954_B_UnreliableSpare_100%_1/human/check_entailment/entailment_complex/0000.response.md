Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements. It then checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the elements are not all equal, the program finds the minimum length of a subarray with all elements equal. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of the current subarray with equal elements. The minimum length is updated whenever a new subarray with equal elements is found.

Finally, the program prints the minimum length of a subarray with all elements equal, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
