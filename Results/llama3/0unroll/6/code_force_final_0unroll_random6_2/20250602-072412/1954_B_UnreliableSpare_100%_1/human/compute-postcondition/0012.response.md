Postcondition: **The value of `ans` is the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is the length of the last subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is True, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum length of a subarray in `arr` with all elements equal to `val`, which is `ans`, is printed.**
