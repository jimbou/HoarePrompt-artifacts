Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then uses a loop to print the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The loop iterates from 1 to n, and for each iteration, it prints the coordinates (1, i), where i is the current iteration number.

However, the program has a logical error. The loop should iterate from 1 to n, but it should print the coordinates (i, 1) and (1, i) for each iteration, not just (1, i). This is because the problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, and printing only (1, i) does not achieve this.

Moreover, the program has a syntax error. The last line of the program is `print(' ')`, which is unnecessary and will cause a syntax error.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
