The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the number of lines to print for that test case. The function then prints a series of lines, each containing the number 1 followed by a space and then a number from 1 to n, for each test case. The total number of lines printed is equal to the initial value of t.
