Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. However, the program simply prints the number 1 followed by a space and then a number from 1 to n for each test case, without considering the Manhattan distances between cells.

The program's output does not match the expected output provided in the problem description. For example, for the input n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, the expected output is:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly calculating the Manhattan distances between cells and is not maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
