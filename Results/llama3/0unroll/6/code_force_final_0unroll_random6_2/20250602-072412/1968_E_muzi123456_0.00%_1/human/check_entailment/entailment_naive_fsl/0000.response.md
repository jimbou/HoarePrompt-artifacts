Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program simply prints the coordinates (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is:

2 1
2 3
3 1

Which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
