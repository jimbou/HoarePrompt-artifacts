Output State: **The output state will be a series of lines, each containing the number 1 followed by a space and then a number from 1 to n, where n is the input number. The number of lines will be equal to the initial value of t.**

In natural language, the output state will be a series of lines, each containing the number 1 followed by a space and then a number from 1 to n, where n is the input number. The number of lines will be equal to the initial value of t. For example, if t is 3 and the input numbers are 2, 3, and 4, the output state will be:

1 1
1 2
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4

Note that the output state will vary depending on the initial value of t and the input numbers.
