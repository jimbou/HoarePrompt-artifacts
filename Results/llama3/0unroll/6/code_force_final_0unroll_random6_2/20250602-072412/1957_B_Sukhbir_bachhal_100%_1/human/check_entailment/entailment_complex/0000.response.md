Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the number of bits in the binary representation of a given integer minus 1. This function is used to determine the maximum number of 1s that can be achieved in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the integers.

The main program iterates over the test cases, and for each test case, it checks if n is greater than 1. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the maximum number of 1s that can be achieved using the `func_1` function and constructs the sequence of integers accordingly. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of k.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `func_1` function to calculate the number of bits in the binary representation of an integer minus 1 is a clever approach to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the integers.

Correctness: **True**
