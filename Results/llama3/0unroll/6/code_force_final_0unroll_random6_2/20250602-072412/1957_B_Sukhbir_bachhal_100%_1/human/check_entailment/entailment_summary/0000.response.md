Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k, which represent the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.

If n is greater than 1, the program calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of k minus 1 using the func_1 function. It then constructs the sequence by appending the value 2 to the power of the calculated counter minus 1, followed by the difference between k and the previously appended value. The remaining n-2 positions in the sequence are filled with zeros.

If n is 1, the program simply prints the value of k.

The func_1 function calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of a given integer minus 1. It does this by continuously right-shifting the bits of the integer until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the constructed sequence.

Correctness: **True**
