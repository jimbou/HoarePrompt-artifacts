#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a list of two integers.
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, which is an integer value.
    #State: n is a list of two integers, and the sum of the integers in the list is not equal to 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is 0, position is the number of bits in the initial value of n.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns the number of bits in the initial value of n minus 1, where n is 0. Since n is 0, the number of bits in its initial value is 1 (because 0 can be represented with a single bit). Therefore, the program returns 1 - 1 = 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of a given integer, minus 1. If the input integer is 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the number of bits in the initial value of the integer minus 1.
