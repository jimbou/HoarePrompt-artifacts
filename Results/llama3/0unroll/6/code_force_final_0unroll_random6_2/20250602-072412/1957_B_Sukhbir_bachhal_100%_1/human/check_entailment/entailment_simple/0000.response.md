Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

The program uses a function `func_1(k)` to find the number of bits in the binary representation of k. This function works by right-shifting the bits of k until it becomes 0, and counting the number of shifts. The number of shifts is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k.

The main part of the program then constructs the sequence of integers. If n is greater than 1, it appends `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - arr[-1]` to the array, where `counter` is the number of bits in the binary representation of k. This is done to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the integers. The remaining n-2 integers are set to 0.

If n is 1, the program simply prints k.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
