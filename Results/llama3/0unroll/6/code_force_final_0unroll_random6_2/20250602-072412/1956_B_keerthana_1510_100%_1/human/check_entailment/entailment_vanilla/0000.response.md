Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal play of their opponent.

The provided Python program uses a clever approach to solve this problem. It reads the input lines in steps of 2, starting from the third line (index 2), which corresponds to the lines containing the card numbers in the player's hand.

For each line, it splits the line into tokens (card numbers) and counts the number of tokens. It then uses a set to count the number of unique tokens (card numbers). The difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens gives the number of duplicate card numbers in the player's hand.

Since the opponent plays optimally, the player can only score points by playing a card that has a duplicate in their hand. Therefore, the maximum number of points the player can score is equal to the number of duplicate card numbers in their hand.

The program prints this value for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
