Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves distributing 2n cards between two players, with each card having an integer from 1 to n. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

The provided Python program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains n integers, representing the cards in the player's hand.

The program calculates the number of duplicate integers in each test case by splitting the second line into tokens, converting them to a set (which removes duplicates), and then subtracting the length of the set from the length of the original list of tokens. This gives the number of duplicate integers, which is the maximum number of points the player can score.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately calculates the number of duplicate integers in each test case, which is the key to solving the problem. The use of sets to remove duplicates is an efficient and effective approach.

Correctness: **True**
