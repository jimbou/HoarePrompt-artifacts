Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of cards, which is ignored. The second line contains the integers on the cards in the player's hand. The program calculates and prints the number of duplicate integers in each test case, which is the maximum number of points the player can get by taking their turns optimally.

The program uses a clever trick to calculate the number of duplicate integers. It splits the line into tokens (integers) and then converts the list of tokens to a set, which removes duplicates. The difference between the length of the list of tokens and the length of the set is the number of duplicate integers.

The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2 times. This assumption is guaranteed by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
