Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It reads the input from stdin, processes each test case, and prints the maximum number of points that can be scored.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. `[*open(0)][2::2]`: This line reads the input from stdin and selects every other line starting from the third line (index 2). This is because each test case consists of two lines, and we're only interested in the second line of each test case.

2. `for line in ...`: This loop iterates over each selected line.

3. `tokens := line.split()`: This line splits each line into a list of tokens (the integers on the cards in your hand).

4. `len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens})`: This expression calculates the number of duplicate integers in the list of tokens. The `*` operator unpacks the list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates. The difference between the length of the original list and the length of the set is the number of duplicates.

5. `print(...)`: This line prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the maximum number of points that can be scored.

Correctness: **True**
