Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If this condition is met, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. Otherwise, it returns None.

`func_2` calls `func_1` with extroverts and universals as arguments and adds the result to the number of introverts. If `func_1` returns None, `func_2` returns -1.

The program's logic is correct. It first calculates the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals using `func_1`. If this is not possible (i.e., `func_1` returns None), it returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result, as each introvert needs a separate tent.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
