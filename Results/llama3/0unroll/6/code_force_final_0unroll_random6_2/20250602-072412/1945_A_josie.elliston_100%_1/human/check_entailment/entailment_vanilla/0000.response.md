Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the universals. If not, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that it is impossible to accommodate the participants, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` and returns the total.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants, such as when there are extroverts left over who cannot be accommodated with universals. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed in all other cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
