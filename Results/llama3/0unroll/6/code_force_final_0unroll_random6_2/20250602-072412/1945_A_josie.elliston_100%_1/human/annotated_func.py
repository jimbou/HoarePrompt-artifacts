#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None.
        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers, and if extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the ceiling of the sum of two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, divided by 3, but only if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3 when extroverts is not divisible by 3. Otherwise, it returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals), where introverts is a non-negative integer, and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals) depends on the values of extroverts and universals, which are both non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a value based on the input parameters introverts, extroverts, and universals. It calls another function, func_1, with extroverts and universals as arguments, and if func_1 returns a value, it adds this value to introverts and returns the sum. If func_1 returns None, the function returns -1. The function assumes that introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
