Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. 

The function `func_1` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it means that the remaining extroverts cannot be accommodated with two others, so it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by dividing their total count by 3 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function.

The function `func_2` calculates the total number of tents needed by calling `func_1` and adding the number of introverts. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that the remaining extroverts cannot be accommodated with two others, so it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the total number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and the case where the number of universals is not enough to accommodate the remaining extroverts. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and it will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
