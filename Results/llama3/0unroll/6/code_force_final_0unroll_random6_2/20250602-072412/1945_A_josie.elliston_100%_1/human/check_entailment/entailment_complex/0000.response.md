Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, considering their preferences for living alone, with one other person, or with two others.

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If this condition is not met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

Function 2 (`func_2`) calls `func_1` with extroverts and universals as arguments and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is not larger than or equal to 3. In such cases, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals. It ensures that each introvert lives alone, each extrovert lives with two others, and each universal lives with any option.

Therefore, the given program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
