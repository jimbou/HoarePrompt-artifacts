Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3. If it is, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as input and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is not larger than or equal to 3. In these cases, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is divisible by 3 or the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3. In these cases, it returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the participants.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
