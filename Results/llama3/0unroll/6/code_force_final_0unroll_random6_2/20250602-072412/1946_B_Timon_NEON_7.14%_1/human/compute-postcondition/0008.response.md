Postcondition: **The output state is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two zeros and the length of arr minus 1, and the second list contains the length of arr minus 1, max_sum is -1. If the length of total_max_segment is 1, then total_max_segment is a list containing only one element which is -1. Otherwise, total_max_segment is a list containing the length of arr minus 1.**
