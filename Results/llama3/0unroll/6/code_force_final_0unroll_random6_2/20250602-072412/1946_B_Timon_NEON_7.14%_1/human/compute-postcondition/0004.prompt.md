Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output state is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two zeros and the length of arr minus 1, and the second list contains the length of arr minus 1, max_sum is -1, and total_max_segment is a list containing -1.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
