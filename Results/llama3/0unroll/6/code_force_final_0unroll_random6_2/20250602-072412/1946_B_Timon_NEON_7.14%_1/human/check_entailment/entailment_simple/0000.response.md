Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have an array of n integers and you can perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any contiguous subarray of the array (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such operations.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the number of operations. It then reads the array itself.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 calculates the remainder of a number when divided by 1000000007. func_2 finds the maximum segment in the array that can be used to maximize the sum of the array after k operations.

The program then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations by multiplying the maximum segment by 2 to the power of k and adding the sum of the array minus the maximum segment.

Finally, the program prints the result of func_1 applied to the calculated maximum possible sum.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum segment, the maximum possible sum, and the result modulo 1000000007.

Correctness: **True**
