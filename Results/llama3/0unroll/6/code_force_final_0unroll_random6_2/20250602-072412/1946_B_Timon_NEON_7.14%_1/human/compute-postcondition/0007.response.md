Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two zeros and the length of arr minus 1, and the second list contains the length of arr minus 1, max_sum is -1, and total_max_segment is a list containing only one element which is -1.**

In this output state, the value of total_max_segment has been updated to a list containing only one element which is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
