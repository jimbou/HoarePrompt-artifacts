#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers. The returned list contains either a single element -1 or the length of the input list minus 1. The function appears to be finding the maximum segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in the input list, but the exact logic is not explicitly stated. However, based on the code, it seems that the function is grouping consecutive non-negative numbers into segments, keeping track of the maximum segment found so far, and returning the length of the maximum segment minus 1. If no such segment is found, the function returns -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer and quantity is a non-negative integer
    answer = 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function initializes a variable named "answer" to 0.
