Correctness: **False**.

The program is incomplete and does not provide a solution to the problem. The function `func_3` is not implemented, and the other functions do not seem to be related to the problem description.

The problem description asks to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. However, the provided code does not attempt to solve this problem.

To solve this problem, we would need to implement a function that takes the array and the number of operations as input and returns the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. This would likely involve using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to find the optimal subarray to select and insert at each step.

Since the provided code does not attempt to solve the problem, it is incorrect.
