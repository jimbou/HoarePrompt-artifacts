Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If a move is not on the diagonal, it reduces the size of the chessboard by 2, otherwise, it reduces it by 1.

The program then calls the function func_1 with the updated size of the chessboard. This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is the updated size of the chessboard. The Fibonacci sequence is used to calculate the number of different final configurations possible.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 1), then iteratively calculates the next Fibonacci numbers using the recurrence relation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]. The modulo operation is used to prevent overflow.

Finally, the program prints the result of the function call, which is the number of different final configurations possible.

Correctness: **True**
