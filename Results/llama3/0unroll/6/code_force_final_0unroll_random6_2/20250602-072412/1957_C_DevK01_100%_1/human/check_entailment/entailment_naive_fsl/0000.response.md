Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first updates the size of the chessboard n based on the k moves made, reducing it by 2 for each move where the row and column are different, and by 1 for each move where the row and column are the same. Then it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

The dynamic programming function func_1(n) calculates the number of possible final configurations for an n x n chessboard. It starts with a list dp containing the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, and then iteratively calculates the number of possible final configurations for larger n. The recurrence relation used is dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9), which is derived from the fact that for each row, there are two possible configurations (either a white rook or a black rook), and for each column, there are i - 1 possible configurations (either a white rook or a black rook in one of the remaining rows).

The program correctly handles the case where n is large by using modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow.

Overall, the program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations, and it correctly handles the case where n is large. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
