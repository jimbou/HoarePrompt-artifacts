Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The function func_1 calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board, taking into account the mirroring of moves by the computer. The main part of the program correctly updates the size of the board based on the moves already made and then calls func_1 to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
