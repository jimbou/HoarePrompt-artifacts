Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 for each non-diagonal move (since the computer mirrors the move) and 1 for each diagonal move (since the computer skips its turn). It then uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which represents the number of possible final configurations for a board of size n x n. The Fibonacci sequence is used because each move can be either a diagonal move (which doesn't affect the number of possible configurations) or a non-diagonal move (which splits the board into two smaller boards).

The program correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid overflow and returns the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
