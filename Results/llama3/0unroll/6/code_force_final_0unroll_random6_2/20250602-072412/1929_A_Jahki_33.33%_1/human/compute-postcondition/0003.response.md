Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, `2 <= num2 <= 100`, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `order` is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. The current value of `order` is 0, indicating that there are no pairs of adjacent elements in `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.**
