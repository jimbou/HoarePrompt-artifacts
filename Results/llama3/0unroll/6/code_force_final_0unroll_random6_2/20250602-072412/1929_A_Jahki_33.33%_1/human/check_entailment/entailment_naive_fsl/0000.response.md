Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. However, this function is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

In the problem description, it is stated that Sasha can rearrange the elements of the array in any way to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program should always sort the array in ascending order and calculate the beauty, regardless of whether the array is already sorted or not.

The `func_1` function is unnecessary and can cause the program to print 0 as the beauty of the array, even if the array can be rearranged to have a higher beauty. For example, if the input array is [3, 2, 1], the program will print 0 as the beauty, but the correct beauty is 2, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [1, 2, 3].

To fix this issue, the program should remove the `func_1` function and always sort the array in ascending order before calculating the beauty.
