Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program takes the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements as input. It then calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array in ascending order and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the input array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is already sorted, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, the program sorts the array, calculates the maximum beauty, and prints the result.

The execution summary indicates that the `func_1` function correctly determines whether the input list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The use of the `func_1` function to check if the input array is already sorted is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
