Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, `2 <= num2 <= 100`, all elements in `a` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `order` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `num2` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code only introduces a new variable `order` and assigns it the value 0. The length of the list `a` is still represented by `num2`, and the elements in `a` are still integers between 1 and 10^9.
