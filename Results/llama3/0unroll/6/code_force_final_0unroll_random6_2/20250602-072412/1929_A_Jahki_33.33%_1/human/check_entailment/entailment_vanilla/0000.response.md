Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program attempts to solve this problem by first checking if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already sorted, the program prints 0 as the beauty of the array.

3. If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

4. However, there is a logical error in the program. The `func_1` function checks if the array is sorted in ascending order, but it does not handle the case where the array is already sorted in descending order. In such a case, the beauty of the array would be 0, but the program would incorrectly calculate the beauty as if the array were not sorted.

5. Additionally, the program uses the `isdigit` method to filter out non-digit characters from the input string, but this is not necessary since the input is guaranteed to be a list of integers.

6. The program also uses a redundant `if` statement to check if the array is sorted before calculating the beauty. If the array is not sorted, the program can simply sort it and calculate the beauty without the need for the `if` statement.

Correctness: **False**
