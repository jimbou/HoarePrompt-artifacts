Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0 as the beauty of the array.

If the array is not sorted, it sorts the array in non-decreasing order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted by iterating through the array and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds any pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element, it increments the `order` variable. If `order` is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means the array is sorted and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
