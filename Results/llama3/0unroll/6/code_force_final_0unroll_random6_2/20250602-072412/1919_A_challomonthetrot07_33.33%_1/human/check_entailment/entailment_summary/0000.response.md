Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the rules provided. The program uses a series of if-else statements to check the conditions of the game and print the winner accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- If a == b, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and since both players have the same number of coins, Alice will eventually run out of coins first.

- If a == 1, Alice wins because she can swap wallets with Bob and then remove a coin from Bob's wallet, forcing Bob to make a move with an empty wallet.

- If b == 1, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and since Bob has only one coin, Alice will eventually run out of coins first.

- If a % 2 == 1, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and since a is odd, Alice will eventually run out of coins first.

- If a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1, Alice wins because she can swap wallets with Bob and then remove a coin from Bob's wallet, forcing Bob to make a move with an empty wallet.

- If a > b, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and since a is greater than b, Alice will eventually run out of coins first.

- In all other cases, Alice wins because she can make moves that will force Bob to run out of coins first.

The program correctly implements these rules and prints the winner for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
