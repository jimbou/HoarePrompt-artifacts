Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, but the program does not take into account the fact that a player can choose to exchange wallets with their opponent.

For example, if Alice has 3 coins and Bob has 1 coin, the program will output "Bob" because it checks if a == b, a == 1, or b == 1, and then checks the parity of a and b. However, in this case, Alice can choose to exchange wallets with Bob, so that she has 1 coin and Bob has 3 coins. Then, Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, leaving him with 2 coins. Alice can then remove a coin from her wallet, leaving her with 0 coins. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin. Alice can then exchange wallets with Bob again, so that she has 1 coin and Bob has 0 coins. Bob will then be unable to make a move, so Alice will win.

However, the program does not consider this possibility and outputs "Bob" instead of "Alice". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
