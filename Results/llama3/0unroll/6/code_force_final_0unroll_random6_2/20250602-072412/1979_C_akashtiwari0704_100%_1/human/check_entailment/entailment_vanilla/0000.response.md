Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers using a custom `lcm` function. This LCM represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if any outcome wins.

4. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the amount received back for each outcome is at least the LCM.

5. The program checks if the sum of the coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

6. If the sum is less than the LCM, it constructs a string `ans` containing the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome and prints it.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues:

* The variable `sumo` is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple conditional statement.
* The `ans` string can be constructed more efficiently using a list comprehension and the `join` method.

Despite these minor issues, the program's correctness is not affected.

Correctness: **True**
