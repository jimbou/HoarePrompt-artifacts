Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to calculate the total amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized, which is a necessary condition for the problem.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. If it is not, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, and the case where the multipliers are all different. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, in which case the program prints -1.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
