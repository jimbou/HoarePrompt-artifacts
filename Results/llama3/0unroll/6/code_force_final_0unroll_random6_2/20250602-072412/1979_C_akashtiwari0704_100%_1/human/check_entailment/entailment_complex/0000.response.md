Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers using the `lcm` function, which is correct.
3. It modifies each integer to be the LCM divided by the integer, which is the correct approach to ensure that the sum of the modified integers is less than the LCM.
4. It checks if the sum of the modified integers is greater than or equal to the LCM, and if so, prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the modified integers.
5. The program repeats this process for all test cases, leaving the input stream empty and the original input values unchanged.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The use of the `lcm` function to calculate the LCM of the integers is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
