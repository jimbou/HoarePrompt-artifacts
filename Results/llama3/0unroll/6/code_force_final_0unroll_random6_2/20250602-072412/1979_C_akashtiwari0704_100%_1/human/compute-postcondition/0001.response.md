Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, each containing the modified values of the list 'a' for each test case, or -1 if the sum of the modified values is greater than or equal to the least common multiple of the original values. The value of 't' remains unchanged, stdin is empty after reading all test cases, and the variables 'T', 'bets', 'prod', 'sumo', and 'ans' are no longer defined.**
