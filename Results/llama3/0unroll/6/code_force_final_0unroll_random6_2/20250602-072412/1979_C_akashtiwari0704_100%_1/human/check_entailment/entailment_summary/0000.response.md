Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case separately.
2. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the given integers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the integers.
3. It then modifies each integer to be the LCM divided by the integer. This is a key step in the solution, as it ensures that the sum of the modified integers is less than the LCM.
4. The program checks if the sum of the modified integers is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the modified integers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. The use of the LCM is a clever trick that allows the program to find a solution that satisfies the problem's constraints.

Correctness: **True**
