#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
    t = int(input())

            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, each containing the modified values of the list 'a' for each test case, or -1 if the sum of the modified values is greater than or equal to the least common multiple of the original values. The value of 't' remains unchanged, stdin is empty after reading all test cases, and the variables 'T', 'bets', 'prod', 'sumo', and 'ans' are no longer defined.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers, modifies each integer to be the LCM divided by the integer, and checks if the sum of the modified integers is greater than or equal to the LCM. If so, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the modified integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases, leaving the input stream empty and the original input values unchanged.
