This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers, modifies each integer to be the LCM divided by the integer, and checks if the sum of the modified integers is greater than or equal to the LCM. If so, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the modified integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases, leaving the input stream empty and the original input values unchanged.
