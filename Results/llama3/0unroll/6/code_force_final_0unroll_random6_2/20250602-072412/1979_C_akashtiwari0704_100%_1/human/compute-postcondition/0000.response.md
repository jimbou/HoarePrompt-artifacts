The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line containing an integer `n`, the input read by `int(input())` is the first line of the first test case, which is an integer `n`.

Therefore, the value of `t` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of n integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of n integers.**
