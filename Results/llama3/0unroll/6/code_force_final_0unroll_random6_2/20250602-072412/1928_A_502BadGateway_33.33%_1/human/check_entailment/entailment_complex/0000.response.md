Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming a new rectangle from these two rectangles. The problem statement also mentions that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are considered the same.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns 'yes' if `b` is even and 'no' if `b` is odd. However, this function does not correctly solve the problem.

The function only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the value of `a`. According to the problem statement, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that both `a` and `b` must be considered when determining whether another rectangle can be formed.

For example, if `a` is 3 and `b` is 2, the function will return 'no' because `b` is not even. However, Bob can cut the rectangle into two 3x1 rectangles and then form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correct solution must consider both `a` and `b` when determining whether another rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
