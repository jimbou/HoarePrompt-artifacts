Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, the input `3 2` should return "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1` rectangles and then formed into a `1 x 6` rectangle, but the program returns "No".

A correct solution would need to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and check if any of them can be formed into a different rectangle.
