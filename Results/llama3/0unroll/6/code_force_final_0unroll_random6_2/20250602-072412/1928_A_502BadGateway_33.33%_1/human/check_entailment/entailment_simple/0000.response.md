Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that if `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides, regardless of whether `b` is even or odd.

For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 3`, the program will return `'no'`, but Bob can actually cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by cutting it into two `2 x 3` rectangles.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
