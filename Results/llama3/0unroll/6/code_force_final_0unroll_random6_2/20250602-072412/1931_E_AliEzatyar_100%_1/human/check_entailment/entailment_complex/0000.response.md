Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
3. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the array and the number of zeros that can be removed by Anna's moves.
4. The program correctly determines the winner of the game by comparing the total number of digits minus the number of zeros that can be removed with the value of `m + 1`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. The use of the `func_1` function to count trailing zeros is a nice touch, as it simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
