Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by determining who will win the game based on the given list of integers and the parameter m. The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases and initializes an array to store the answers.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers n and the parameter m, and then reads the list of integers.
3. It calculates the total number of digits in the list and identifies the numbers that have trailing zeros.
4. It sorts the numbers with trailing zeros in descending order and calculates the total number of zeros that can be removed by reversing the numbers.
5. It subtracts the total number of removable zeros from the total number of digits to get the final number of digits.
6. If the final number of digits is greater than or equal to m + 1, it means Sasha wins, otherwise Anna wins.

The program uses a function func_1 to count the number of trailing zeros in a given number. This function works by iterating over the digits of the number from right to left and counting the number of zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
