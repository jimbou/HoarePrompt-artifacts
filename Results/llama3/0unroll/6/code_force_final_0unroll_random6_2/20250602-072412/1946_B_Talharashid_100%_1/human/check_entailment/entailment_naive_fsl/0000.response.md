Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only negative numbers. In this case, the program will always return 0, because the variable `c` will always be 0 and `maxi` will always be 0. However, the correct answer should be the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, which can be negative.

For example, if the input is:

2 2
-4 -7

The program will return 0, but the correct answer is 999999996.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the input array contains only negative numbers. The program assumes that there will always be a positive number in the array, which is not always the case.
