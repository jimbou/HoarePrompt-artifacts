Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a result for each test case by finding the maximum sum of a subarray, multiplying it by 2 to the power of k, subtracting the maximum sum, adding the sum of all elements, and taking the result modulo 1000000007. The results for all test cases are then printed out.**
