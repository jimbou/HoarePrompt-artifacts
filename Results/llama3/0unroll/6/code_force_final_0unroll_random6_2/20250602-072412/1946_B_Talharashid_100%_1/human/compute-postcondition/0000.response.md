Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a test case. The calculation involves finding the maximum sum of a subarray in the input list, multiplying it by 2 to the power of k, subtracting the maximum sum, adding the sum of all elements in the list, and taking the result modulo 1000000007.**
