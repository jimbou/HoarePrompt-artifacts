Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins.

The provided Python program correctly implements this insight by calculating the sum of the coins in each test case and checking its parity. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because, in a game with an even number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he wins. Conversely, with an odd number of coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to lose.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check the parity of the sum is efficient and accurate.

Correctness: **True**
