Postcondition: ***The loop has iterated over all test cases and extracted the values of a and b for each test case. The values of a and b are the last values read from the input for each test case. If the sum of a and b is even, 'bob' is being printed. If the sum of a and b is odd, 'alice' is being printed.***
