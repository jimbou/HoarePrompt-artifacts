Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by determining the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win. The program correctly implements this logic by calculating the sum of the coins, checking its parity, and printing the corresponding result.

The key insight here is that the game is symmetric, and the players' moves are deterministic. Therefore, the outcome of the game depends only on the initial state, which is the number of coins in each player's wallet. By analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes, we can conclude that the parity of the sum of the coins determines the winner.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
