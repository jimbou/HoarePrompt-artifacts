Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then determines the parity of the sum of the coins in each test case and prints 'bob' if the sum is even or 'alice' if the sum is odd. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding result for each case.**
