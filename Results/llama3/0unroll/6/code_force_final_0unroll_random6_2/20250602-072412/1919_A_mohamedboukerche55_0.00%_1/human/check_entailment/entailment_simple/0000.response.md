Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by observing that the game is won by the player who makes the last move. This happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. If the sum is even, the player who makes the first move (Alice) will always be left with an even number of coins, and thus will lose. If the sum is odd, Alice will always be left with an odd number of coins, and thus will win.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The loop iterates over all test cases, but the output is only printed for the last test case. This is because the output is printed outside the loop. To fix this, the output should be printed inside the loop.

Correctness: **False**
