Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^4. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has three lines of input, with specific constraints on the values of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
