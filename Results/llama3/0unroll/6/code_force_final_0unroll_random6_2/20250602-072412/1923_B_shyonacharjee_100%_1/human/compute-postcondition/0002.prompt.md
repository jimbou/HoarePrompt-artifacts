You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: The loop will output 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the player can survive the monsters or not. The output will be in the same order as the input test cases. The values of t, n, k, a, and x will remain unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
