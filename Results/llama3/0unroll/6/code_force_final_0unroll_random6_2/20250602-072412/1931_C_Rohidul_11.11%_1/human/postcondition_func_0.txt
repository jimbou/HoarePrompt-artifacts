This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer array. It calculates and prints the maximum possible length of a subarray that can be obtained by removing the minimum number of elements from the given array, for each test case. The function handles arrays with repeated elements at the start and end, as well as arrays with distinct start and end elements. It outputs the maximum possible subarray length for each test case, which can be zero if the array cannot be reduced to a single element.
