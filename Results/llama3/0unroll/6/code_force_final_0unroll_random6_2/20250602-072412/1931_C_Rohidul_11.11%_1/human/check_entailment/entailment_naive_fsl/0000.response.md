Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the cases where the first and last elements of the array are the same or different.

For example, consider the input:

    8
    8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the first and last elements are the same, but there are other elements in between that are different.

Another example is:

    9
    9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

The program will output 7, but the correct answer is 6. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple sequences of the same element.

The program only checks if the first and last elements are the same, and if they are, it assumes that the entire array can be made equal by replacing all elements with the first element. However, this is not always the case. The program needs to consider all possible sequences of the same element and find the minimum number of replacements needed to make the entire array equal.
