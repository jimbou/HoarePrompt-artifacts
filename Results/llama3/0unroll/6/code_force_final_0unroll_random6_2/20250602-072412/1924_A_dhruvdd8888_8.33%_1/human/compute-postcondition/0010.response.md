Functionality: **This function determines if a given string can be rearranged to contain a specified number of unique substrings of a certain length. It takes as input a string and three integers: the desired number of unique substrings, the length of the substrings, and the number of characters in the alphabet used in the string. If the string can be rearranged to meet the specified conditions, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' followed by a list of possible rearrangements that meet the conditions, with each rearrangement being a string that includes all characters in the alphabet not present in the original string, repeated to fill the desired length.**
