Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. If not, it prints a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program uses a sliding window approach to check for the occurrence of all possible substrings of length n. It maintains a set `us` of the first k lowercase English alphabets and a set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window. It also maintains a list `ans` to store the characters that are part of the substrings that occur in the string s.

The program correctly handles the case when the string s does not contain all possible substrings of length n. In this case, it prints 'NO' followed by a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Correctness: **True**
