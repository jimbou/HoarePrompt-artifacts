Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0**.

The code reads the first line of the test case from stdin, assigning the values of n, k, and m. It then reads the string s from stdin. The set us is created containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. The variables win, ans, and ps are initialized as an empty set, an empty list, and 0, respectively. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-1 test cases. The values of n, k, m, and s are updated based on the input.
