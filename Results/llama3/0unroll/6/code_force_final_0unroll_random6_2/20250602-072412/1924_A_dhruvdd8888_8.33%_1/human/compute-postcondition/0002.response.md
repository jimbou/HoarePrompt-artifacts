Output State: The loop iterates over each character in the string s. If the character is in the set us, it is added to the set win. If the length of win is equal to k, the character is appended to the list ans, the variable ps is incremented by 1, and the set win is cleared. After the loop finishes, the output state will be: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
