#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^5) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over each character in the string s. If the character is in the set us, it is added to the set win. If the length of win is equal to k, the character is appended to the list ans, the variable ps is incremented by 1, and the set win is cleared. After the loop finishes, the output state will be: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that 'NO' is printed for each character in the set us that is not in the set win. The string printed for each character is the concatenation of the current string in ans, the character, and 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines if a given string can be rearranged to contain a specified number of unique substrings of a certain length. It takes as input a string and three integers: the desired number of unique substrings, the length of the substrings, and the number of characters in the alphabet used in the string. If the string can be rearranged to meet the specified conditions, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' followed by a list of possible rearrangements that meet the conditions, with each rearrangement being a string that includes all characters in the alphabet not present in the original string, repeated to fill the desired length.
