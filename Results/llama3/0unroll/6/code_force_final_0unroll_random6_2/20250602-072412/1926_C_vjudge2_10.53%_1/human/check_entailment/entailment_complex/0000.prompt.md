Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^4) and then a sequence of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5).

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5) of length t, stdin is empty.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5) of length t, values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the rest are unchanged, sum_values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and the rest are unchanged, total is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5) of length t, values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the rest are calculated based on the last digit and the remaining digits of the number, sum_values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and the rest are calculated based on the values and sum_values of the previous number, total is 45.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the list of numbers and prints the sum of values for each number. The sum_values list is updated based on the values and sum_values of the previous number. The total variable remains unchanged at 45. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed sum of values for each number in the numbers list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates a custom sum of values for each number based on its digits, and prints the calculated sums. The function first initializes two lists, values and sum_values, to store the custom sum of values for each number from 0 to the maximum number in the input sequence. It then calculates the custom sum of values for each number in the input sequence by considering the last digit and the remaining digits of the number. Finally, it prints the calculated sum of values for each number in the input sequence.
