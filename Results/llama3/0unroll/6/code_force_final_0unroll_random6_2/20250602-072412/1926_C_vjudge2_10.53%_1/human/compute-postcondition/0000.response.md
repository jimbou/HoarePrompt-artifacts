Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a sequence of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5)**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since the input is greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^4, `t` becomes an integer within this range. The second line initializes an empty list `numbers`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains only the sequence of integers, as the first input has been consumed.
