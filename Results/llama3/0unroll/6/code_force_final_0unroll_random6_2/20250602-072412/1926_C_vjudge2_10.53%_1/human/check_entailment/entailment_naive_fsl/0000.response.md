Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after replacement. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, but it does not handle the case where n is greater than the maximum value in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays.

In the program, the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are initialized with a size of `max(numbers) + 1`, where `numbers` is the list of input numbers. However, the program does not check if the input number `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list. If `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list, the program will access an index out of bounds in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is `n = 200001`, the program will access an index out of bounds in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the input number `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list and handle it accordingly. One possible solution is to increase the size of the `values` and `sum_values` arrays to a larger value, such as `2 * 10^5 + 1`, to handle larger input values.
