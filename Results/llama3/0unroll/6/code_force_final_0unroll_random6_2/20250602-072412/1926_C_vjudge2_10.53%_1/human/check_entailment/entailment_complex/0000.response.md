Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum of values for each number.

The program first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the custom sum of values for each number from 0 to the maximum number in the input sequence. It then calculates the custom sum of values for each number in the input sequence by considering the last digit and the remaining digits of the number.

The program uses a bottom-up approach to calculate the sum of values for each number. It starts by initializing the first 10 elements of the `values` and `sum_values` lists, which represent the sum of values for single-digit numbers. Then, it iterates over the range from 10 to the maximum number in the input sequence, calculating the sum of values for each number based on its last digit and the remaining digits.

Finally, the program prints the calculated sum of values for each number in the input sequence.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the maximum number in the input sequence. This is because the program uses a single loop to calculate the sum of values for each number, and the number of iterations is proportional to the maximum number in the input sequence.

The program's space complexity is also O(n), as it uses two lists of length n to store the custom sum of values for each number.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it should be able to solve the problem within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
