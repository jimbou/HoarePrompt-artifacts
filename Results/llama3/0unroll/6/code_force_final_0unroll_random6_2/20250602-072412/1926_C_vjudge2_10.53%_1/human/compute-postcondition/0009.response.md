Output State: The loop iterates over the list of numbers and prints the sum of values for each number. The sum_values list is updated based on the values and sum_values of the previous number. The total variable remains unchanged at 45. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed sum of values for each number in the numbers list.
