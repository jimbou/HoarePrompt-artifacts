Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the custom sum of values for each number from 0 to the maximum number in the input sequence.

The program first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the custom sum of values for each number. It then calculates the custom sum of values for each number in the input sequence by considering the last digit and the remaining digits of the number. This is done by recursively breaking down the number into its last digit and the remaining digits, and using the previously calculated values for these parts to calculate the custom sum of values for the entire number.

Finally, the program prints the calculated sum of values for each number in the input sequence.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates a custom sum of values for each number based on its digits, and prints the calculated sums.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The calculation of `values[i]` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the sum of the digits of `i`, not the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. This is because the problem statement requires the sum of the digits of each number, not the sum of the custom sum of values of its last digit and remaining digits.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
