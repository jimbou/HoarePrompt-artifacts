Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates a custom sum of values for each number based on its digits, and prints the calculated sums. The function first initializes two lists, values and sum_values, to store the custom sum of values for each number from 0 to the maximum number in the input sequence. It then calculates the custom sum of values for each number in the input sequence by considering the last digit and the remaining digits of the number. Finally, it prints the calculated sum of values for each number in the input sequence.**
