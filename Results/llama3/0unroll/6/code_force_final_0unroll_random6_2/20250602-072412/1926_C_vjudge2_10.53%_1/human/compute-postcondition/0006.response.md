Output State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5) of length t, values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the rest are calculated using the formula values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder] where last is the last digit of i and remainder is the number formed by the digits of i excluding the last digit, sum_values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 where the first 10 elements are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and the rest are calculated using the formula sum_values[i] = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1], total is 45.
