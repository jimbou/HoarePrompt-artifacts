Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less or equal than 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5) of length t, values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1, sum_values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1, total is 0**

The code initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, each with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. All elements in these lists are initialized to 0. Additionally, a variable `total` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `t` and `numbers` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
