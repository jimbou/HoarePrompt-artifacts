This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the total remaining size of a subtree rooted at a given vertex s in a tree, where a good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to a given threshold x. The function traverses the tree in a post-order manner, aggregating the good components and remaining sizes of child vertices to their parent vertices.
