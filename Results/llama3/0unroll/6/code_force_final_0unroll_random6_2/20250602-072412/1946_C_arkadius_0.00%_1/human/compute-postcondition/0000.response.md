Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**.

The code first reads two positive integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` and `k` are already defined as positive integers in the initial state, their values are updated to the newly read values. The condition `1 <= k < n <= 10^5` still holds, as the new values of `n` and `k` are not constrained by the code.

The second line creates a new `Tree` object with `n` nodes and assigns it to the variable `tree`. The `Tree` object is not defined in the initial state, so it is introduced as a new variable with a specific value.

In summary, the code updates the values of `n` and `k` to new positive integers and introduces a new variable `tree` with a specific value, while maintaining the condition `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`.
