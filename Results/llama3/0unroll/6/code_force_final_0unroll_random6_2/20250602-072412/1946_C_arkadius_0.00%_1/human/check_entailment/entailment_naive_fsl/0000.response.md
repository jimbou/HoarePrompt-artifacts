Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. However, the program does not correctly calculate the size of each remaining connected component.

In the function `func_2`, the program calculates the size of each subtree by recursively calling `func_2` on each child of the current vertex. However, it does not correctly handle the case where a subtree has a size less than x. In this case, the program should not count the subtree as a good component, but it does.

For example, consider a tree with 5 vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The edges are (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5). If we want to remove 1 edge, the program should return 2, because we can remove the edge (1, 3) and get two connected components of size 2 and 3. However, the program returns 1, because it incorrectly counts the subtree rooted at vertex 3 as a good component.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
