Output: **The tree has n nodes and n-1 edges, with each edge connecting two distinct nodes, and k is still a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. The root of the tree is now set to node 0, and the parent of node 0 is set to -1, indicating that it is the root, and the result of the function func_4 with the tree, n, and k as arguments is being printed**
