Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program defines a Tree class with methods to add edges and perform a non-recursive root tree traversal. This is a correct implementation of a tree data structure.

2. The program defines four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. 

   - func_1 performs a post-order traversal of the tree and calculates the number of good components (components with size at least x) and the remaining size of each subtree. This function is correct.

   - func_2 is a recursive version of func_1. It also calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. This function is correct.

   - func_3 checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. It uses the results from func_1 or func_2 to make this check. This function is correct.

   - func_4 performs a binary search to find the maximum value of x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function is correct.

3. The program defines a main function func_5 that reads input, constructs a tree, and calls func_4 to find the maximum value of x. This function is correct.

4. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x, which is efficient and correct.

5. The program handles the case where the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is at least x, which is a correct edge case.

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
