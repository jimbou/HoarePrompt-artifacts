This function determines the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from a tree data structure with n vertices to satisfy a specific condition checked by another function (func_3). It takes no parameters and returns the minimum number of edges to be removed. The function performs a binary search to find this minimum number, iteratively adjusting the search range until it converges on the solution. The tree data structure and the number of vertices (n) remain unchanged throughout the process. The function's purpose is to provide the minimum number of edge removals required to meet the condition specified by func_3, without actually modifying the tree.
