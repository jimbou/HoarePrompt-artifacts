Functionality: **Determines if a tree can be decomposed into connected components with a minimum size, given the number of edges to be removed.**

The function accepts a Tree object, the number of vertices in the tree, the number of edges to be removed, and the minimum size of each remaining connected component as input. It returns True if the number of connected components with size at least the minimum size is greater than the number of edges to be removed, or if the number of connected components equals the number of edges to be removed and the total size of these components is greater than or equal to the minimum size. Otherwise, it returns False.
