Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree with n vertices, where the task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x. It defines a function `func_3` that checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree to get connected components of size at least x. This function is used in the binary search function `func_4` to find the maximum number x.

The program also defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of good components (connected components with size at least x) in the tree, and the total size of the remaining components in the subtrees rooted at the children of a given vertex. This function is used in `func_3` to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree.

The program reads the input data, constructs the tree, and calls the binary search function `func_4` to find the maximum number x. The result is then printed.

The program appears to be correct, as it correctly implements the binary search approach and the necessary functions to solve the problem. The use of a non-recursive approach in `func_1` and the binary search approach in `func_4` ensures that the program can handle large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
