Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, and outputs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. The program then uses a conditional expression to determine the output array `res`. There are three possible cases:
	* If `k` is equal to `n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones (`[1] * n`). This is because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.
	* If `k` is equal to 1, the program outputs an array of numbers from 0 to `n-1` (`range(n)`). This is because an array with distinct elements in increasing order has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
	* If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, the program outputs an array containing only -1 (`[-1]`). This indicates that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.
4. Finally, the program prints the output array `res` using the `*` operator to unpack the array elements.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
