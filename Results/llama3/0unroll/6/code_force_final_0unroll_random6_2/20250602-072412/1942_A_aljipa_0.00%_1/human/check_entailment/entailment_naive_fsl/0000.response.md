Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 3 and k = 2. According to the problem description, there should be exactly k sorted cyclic shifts of the array. However, the program outputs [-1] for this case, which means it does not provide a valid array that satisfies the requirements.

The issue is that the program only checks for the cases when k is equal to n or 1, and does not handle the case when k is between 1 and n. In this case, the program should output an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts, but it does not provide a correct solution.

For example, for the input (3, 2), the program should output an array like [1, 2, 1] which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 1]. However, the program outputs [-1] which is incorrect.
