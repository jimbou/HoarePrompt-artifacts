Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input.
3. The program then constructs a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `n`, the list contains `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, the list contains the numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the list contains a single -1.
4. The program prints the constructed list `res` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If `k` equals `n`, the only way to have `n` sorted cyclic shifts is to have all elements equal, which is achieved by the list of `n` ones.
* If `k` equals 1, the only way to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift is to have a list of distinct elements in increasing order, which is achieved by the list of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
* If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the conditions, so the program correctly outputs a single -1.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
