The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, and then prints a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k equals n, the list contains n ones. If k equals 1, the list contains the numbers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, the list contains a single -1. The function repeats this process t times, producing t lines of output.
