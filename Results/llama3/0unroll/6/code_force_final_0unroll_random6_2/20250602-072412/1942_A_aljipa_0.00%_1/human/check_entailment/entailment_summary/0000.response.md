Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k equals n, it prints a list of n ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.

2. If k equals 1, it prints a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.

3. If k is neither 1 nor n, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
