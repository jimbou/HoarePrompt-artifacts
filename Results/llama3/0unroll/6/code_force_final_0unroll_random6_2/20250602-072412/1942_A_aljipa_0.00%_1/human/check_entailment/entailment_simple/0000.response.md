Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of `k`:

1. If `k` equals `n`, the program outputs a list of `n` ones, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this list are sorted.

2. If `k` equals 1, the program outputs a list of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which is a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of this list is sorted (the original list itself).

3. If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the program outputs a list containing a single -1, which is a valid solution because there is no array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
