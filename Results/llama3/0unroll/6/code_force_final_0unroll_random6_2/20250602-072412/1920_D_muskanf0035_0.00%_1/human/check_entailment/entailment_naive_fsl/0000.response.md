Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the operation type is 2 and the value is greater than 1. In this case, the program should append x copies of the current array to the end of the array, but the current implementation only appends one copy of the array.

For example, if the operations are [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)], the program will append [1, 2] to the end of the array, resulting in [1, 2, 1, 2], but it should append [1, 2] three times, resulting in [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].

To fix this, the program should modify the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array)) for _ in range(value - 1)])` to correctly append x copies of the array.
