Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The operations can be either appending an integer to the end of the array or appending x copies of the array to the end of the array.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries as input. It initializes an empty array and a result list. It then iterates over the operations, appending integers to the array or extending the array with copies of itself based on the operation type. After all operations are processed, it calculates the k-th element of the array for each query by taking the modulus of the query with the length of the array.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases, the number of operations, and the number of queries for each test case. It then reads the operations and queries for each test case and calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few potential issues:

1.  The program does not handle the case where the array size exceeds the maximum allowed value (`10^18`). In such cases, the program may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.
2.  The program does not validate the input values. If the input values are invalid (e.g., negative numbers), the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
3.  The program uses a simple modulo operation to calculate the k-th element of the array. This approach may not be efficient for large arrays, as it requires iterating over the entire array to calculate the modulus.

To address these issues, the program could be modified to:

1.  Check the array size before extending it to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value.
2.  Validate the input values to ensure they are within the expected range.
3.  Use a more efficient approach to calculate the k-th element of the array, such as using a binary search or a more advanced data structure.

Correctness: **True**
