Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. The operations can be of two types: appending an integer `x` to the end of the array, or appending `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. After performing these operations, Jayden has a set of queries where he wants to know the `k`-th element of the array.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes in the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries, and returns a list of results for each query. `func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user, calls `func_1` with the input values, and prints the results.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_1`. In the line where it processes the operation of type 2, it extends the array by appending a copy of itself. This is incorrect because it should append `x` copies of the array, not just one copy. This error will cause the function to produce incorrect results for queries.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
