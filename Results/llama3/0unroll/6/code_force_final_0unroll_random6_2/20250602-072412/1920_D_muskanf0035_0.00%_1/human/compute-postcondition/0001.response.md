Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the function func_1 for the corresponding input values of n, operations, and queries. The length of the output list is equal to the number of iterations t. The values of n, operations, and queries are updated in each iteration, but their initial values are not affected by the loop.**
