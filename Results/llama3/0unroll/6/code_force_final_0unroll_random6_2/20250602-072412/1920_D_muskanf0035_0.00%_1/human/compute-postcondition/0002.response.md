Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer n, a list of lists of two integers (operations), and a list of positive integers (queries). It processes the operations and queries based on the value of n, and returns a list of integers as a result. The function does not modify the input parameters. The purpose of the function is to perform a series of operations and queries based on the input values, and produce a list of results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the function's processing for the corresponding input values.**
