Functionality: This function takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an integer type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to build a list of non-negative integers, and then uses this list to generate a result list by selecting elements from the built list based on the queries. The function returns the result list, leaving the input variables `n`, `operations`, and the built list unchanged.
