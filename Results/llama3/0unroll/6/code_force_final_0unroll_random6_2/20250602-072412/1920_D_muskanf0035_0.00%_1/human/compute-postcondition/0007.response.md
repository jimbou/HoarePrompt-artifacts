Functionality: This function takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an integer type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct a list of non-negative integers, and then uses this list to compute the result for each query by selecting an element from the list based on the query value. The function returns a list of results, one for each query, without modifying the original input variables `n`, operations, and queries.
