Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty. There are `n` operations of two types that he must perform in the given order. The first type of operation appends an integer `x` to the end of array `a`, and the second type of operation appends `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`. After performing all `n` operations, Jayden has `q` queries, and for each query, he wants to know the `k`-th element of array `a`.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries, and returns a list of results, one for each query. `func_2` reads input from the user, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. `func_1` correctly processes the operations to construct the array `a`, and then uses this array to compute the result for each query. `func_2` correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_1`. In the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, the program is appending a copy of the entire array to itself, which is not the correct interpretation of the second type of operation. The correct interpretation is to append `x` copies of the array to itself, not just one copy.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
