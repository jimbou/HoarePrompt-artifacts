Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of lists of two integers, `queries` is a list of positive integers, the length of `operations` is `n`, `t` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned an integer value from the input, and since the input is consumed, stdin is now empty.
