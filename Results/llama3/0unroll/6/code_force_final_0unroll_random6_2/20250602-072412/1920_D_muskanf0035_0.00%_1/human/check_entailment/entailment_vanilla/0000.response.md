Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The operations can be either appending an integer to the end of the array or appending x copies of the current array to the end of the array.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes in the number of operations `n`, the operations themselves, and the queries. It initializes an empty array and a result list. It then iterates over the operations. If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array. If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by appending x copies of the current array. After all operations are processed, it iterates over the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the result list. The k-th element is determined by taking the modulus of k-1 with the length of the array to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the array.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input from the user. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries. It then calls `func_1` with the read input and prints the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the line where it extends the array by appending x copies of the current array, it should be `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array)) for _ in range(value)])` instead of `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. This is because the problem statement specifies that x copies of the array should be appended, but the current code only appends one copy.

Correctness: **False**
