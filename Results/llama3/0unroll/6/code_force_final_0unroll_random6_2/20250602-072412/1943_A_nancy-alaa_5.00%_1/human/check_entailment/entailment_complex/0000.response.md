Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first counts the occurrences of each number in the array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.

2. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it prints that number and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

3. If a number is present in the array, it checks if the count of that number is 1 and if `first` is True. If both conditions are true, it prints that number and breaks the loop. This is because if a number appears only once and `first` is True, it means that Alice has already picked a number that appears only once, and now Bob will pick a number that appears only once, so Alice will pick the current number to maximize the score.

4. If the count of a number is 1 and `first` is False, it sets `first` to True. This is because if a number appears only once and `first` is False, it means that Alice has not yet picked a number that appears only once, so she will pick the current number to maximize the score.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that all numbers appear more than once, so the program will print the smallest number that appears only once in the second occurrence.

The program correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game, so it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
