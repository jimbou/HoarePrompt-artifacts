Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and deleting them, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the occurrences of each element in the input array. It then iterates over the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to n-1) and checks if each value is present in the Counter object. If a value is not present, it means that the MEX is equal to that value, and the program prints it and breaks the loop.

If all values are present in the Counter object, the program checks if any value has a count of 1. If it finds such a value, it means that the MEX is equal to that value, and the program prints it and breaks the loop. If no such value is found, it means that all values appear more than once, and the program prints the smallest value that appears only once in the second occurrence.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
