Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2. It uses a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.
3. The program then iterates over the range of possible integers from 0 to `n-1`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is not present in the `Counter` object (i.e., it's missing from the array). If so, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of the array is the smallest missing non-negative integer.
4. If `i` is present in the `Counter` object, the program checks if its count is 1 and if `first` is `True`. If both conditions are true, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because if `i` appears only once and `first` is `True`, it means that `i` is the smallest number that appears only once in the second occurrence.
5. If `i` appears only once but `first` is `False`, the program sets `first` to `True`. This is because we need to find the smallest number that appears only once in the second occurrence.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, the program continues to the next iteration.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. By finding the smallest missing non-negative integer or the smallest number that appears only once in the second occurrence, the program ensures that Alice gets the highest possible score.

Correctness: **True**
