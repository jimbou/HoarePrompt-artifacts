Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it prints that number as the MEX. If a number is present only once and it's not the first occurrence of a number with frequency 1, it prints that number as the MEX. This is because Alice will choose the number with frequency 1 on her first turn, and Bob will choose the number with frequency 1 on his turn, leaving the number with frequency 1 as the MEX.

The program handles the case where the array contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, in which case the MEX is n. It also handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, in which case the MEX is the smallest number that is not present in the array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
