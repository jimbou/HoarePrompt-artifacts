This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers. For each test case, it finds and prints the smallest missing number in the list. If no number is missing, it prints the smallest number that appears only once. If all numbers appear more than once, it prints the smallest number that appears only once in the second occurrence.
