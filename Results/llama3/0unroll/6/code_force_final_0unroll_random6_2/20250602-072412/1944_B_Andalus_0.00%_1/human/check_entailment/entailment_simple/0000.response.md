Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It splits the input list into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. It initializes four lists: `ldb` and `rdb` to store the duplicate elements from the left and right halves, respectively, and `sng` to store the single elements from the left half.
4. It sorts the left and right halves, which is necessary to find the duplicate and single elements.
5. It iterates through the sorted left half and finds the duplicate elements, storing them in `ldb`. It also finds the single elements and stores them in `sng`.
6. It iterates through the sorted right half and finds the duplicate elements, storing them in `rdb`.
7. It prints the elements from `ldb` and `sng` to form the left subset, and then prints the elements from `rdb` and `sng` to form the right subset.
8. The program ensures that the size of the subsets does not exceed `k` by using the `sz` variable to keep track of the current size.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
