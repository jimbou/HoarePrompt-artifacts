Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In natural language, the output state is that `T` has been assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the rest of the input remains the same, containing multiple test cases with two lines each. The first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers `a_1` to `a_{2n}`. The constraints on `n`, `k`, and `a_i` are still valid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^4`.
