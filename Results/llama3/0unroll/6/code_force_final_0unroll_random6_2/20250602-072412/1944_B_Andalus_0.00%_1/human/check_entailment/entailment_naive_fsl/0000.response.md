Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains duplicate elements that are not consecutive. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4], the program will not correctly identify the subsets l and r.

In this case, the program will only consider the first occurrence of each element in the left and right halves of the array, and will not correctly handle the duplicate elements. As a result, the program will not produce the correct output.

For example, if the input is:

4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

The program will output:

1
1

Which is not correct. The correct output should be:

1 2
1 2

Or any other pair of subsets that satisfy the conditions.
