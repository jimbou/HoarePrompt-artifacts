#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.

    #State: The output state is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers are chosen from the input list such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the output. The output is generated by first printing the integers that occur twice in the left half of the input list, then the single integers from the left half, then the integers that occur twice in the right half of the input list, and finally the single integers from the right half. The output is generated for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, separating them into two halves, and identifies the integers that occur twice and those that occur only once in each half. It then prints k integers for each test case, prioritizing the integers that occur twice in each half, followed by the single integers from each half, ensuring that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the output. The function repeats this process for each test case.
