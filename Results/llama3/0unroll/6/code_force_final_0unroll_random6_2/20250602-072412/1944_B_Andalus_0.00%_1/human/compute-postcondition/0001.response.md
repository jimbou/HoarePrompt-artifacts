Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers are chosen from the input list such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the output. The output is generated by first printing the integers that occur twice in the left half of the input list, then the single integers from the left half, then the integers that occur twice in the right half of the input list, and finally the single integers from the right half. The output is generated for each test case.**
