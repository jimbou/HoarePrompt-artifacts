Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, separating the integers into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`.
2. It identifies the integers that occur twice in each half by checking for consecutive equal elements in the sorted lists `lft` and `rgt`. These integers are stored in `ldb` and `rdb`, respectively.
3. It identifies the single integers in the left half by checking for elements that are not equal to their neighbors in the sorted list `lft`. These integers are stored in `sng`.
4. The program then prints the integers for each test case, prioritizing the integers that occur twice in each half, followed by the single integers from each half. It ensures that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the output by only printing each integer once from each half.
5. The program repeats this process for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
