You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))

                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break

            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
    #State: The output state is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers are chosen from the input list such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the output. The output is generated by first printing the integers that occur twice in the left half of the input list, then the single integers from the left half, then the integers that occur twice in the right half of the input list, and finally the single integers from the right half. The output is generated for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
