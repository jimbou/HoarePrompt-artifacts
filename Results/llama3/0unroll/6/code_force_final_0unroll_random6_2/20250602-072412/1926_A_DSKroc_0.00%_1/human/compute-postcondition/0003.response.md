Postcondition: **The variable `ac` and `bc` have been reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop, and the variable `s` has taken on the value of each of the `t` strings from stdin in succession. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`.**
