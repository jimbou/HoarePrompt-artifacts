Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. It then iterates over each string, counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This process is repeated for each of the t strings.**
