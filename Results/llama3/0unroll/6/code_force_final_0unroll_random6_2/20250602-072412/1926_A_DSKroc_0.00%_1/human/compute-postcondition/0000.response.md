Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 32. The stdin still contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, as only the first input (the integer `t`) has been consumed by the `input()` function.
