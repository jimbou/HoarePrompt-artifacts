Postcondition: ***The variables `ac` and `bc` have been reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop, and the variable `s` has taken on the value of each of the `t` strings from stdin in succession. The variable `t` remains unchanged. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, 'B' is printed.***
