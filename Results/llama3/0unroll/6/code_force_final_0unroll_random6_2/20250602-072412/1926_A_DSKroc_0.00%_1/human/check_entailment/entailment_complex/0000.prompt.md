Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `ac` and `bc` will have been reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop, and the variable `s` will have taken on the value of each of the `t` strings from stdin in succession. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *The variables `ac` and `bc` have been reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop, and the variable `s` has taken on the value of each of the `t` strings from stdin in succession. The variable `t` remains unchanged. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, 'B' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. It then iterates over each string, counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This process is repeated for each of the t strings.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
