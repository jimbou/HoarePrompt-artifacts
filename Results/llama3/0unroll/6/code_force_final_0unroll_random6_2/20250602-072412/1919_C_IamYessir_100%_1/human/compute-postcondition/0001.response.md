Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list by distributing the integers into two lists, 'a' and 'b', based on certain conditions. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of increasing subsequences in the two lists, where a subsequence is considered increasing if each element is greater than the previous one.**
