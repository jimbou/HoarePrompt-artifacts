#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).

    #State: The output state will be the total number of increasing subsequences in the input list, where a subsequence is considered increasing if each element is greater than the previous one. The output will be the sum of the number of increasing subsequences in the two lists 'a' and 'b' generated by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list by distributing the integers into two lists, 'a' and 'b', based on certain conditions. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of increasing subsequences in the two lists, where a subsequence is considered increasing if each element is greater than the previous one.
