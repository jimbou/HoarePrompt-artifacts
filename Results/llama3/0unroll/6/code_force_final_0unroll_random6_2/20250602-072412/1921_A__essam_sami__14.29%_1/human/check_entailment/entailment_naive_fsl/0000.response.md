Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) as assumed in the program. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) and between (4, 2) and (4, 5) which are not the sides of the square. The correct sides of the square are between (1, 2) and (4, 2) and between (1, 5) and (4, 5).

The program should calculate the distances between all pairs of points and find the maximum distance which is the length of the diagonal of the square. Then it can calculate the area of the square using the formula: area = (diagonal^2) / 2.
