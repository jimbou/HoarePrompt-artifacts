Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The corners are given in random order, and the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.

2. The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by calculating the square of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two pairs of points. This is based on the fact that the area of a square can be calculated as the square of the length of one of its sides.

3. However, there are a few issues with the program. Firstly, it does not correctly calculate the length of the side of the square. The formula used, `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, calculates the square of the distance between two points, not the length of the side of the square.

4. Secondly, the program compares the two calculated values `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one. This is incorrect because the area of the square should be the square of the length of one of its sides, not the smaller of two calculated values.

5. Finally, the program does not handle the case where the input points do not form a square. Although the problem statement guarantees that the input points form a square, a robust program should still handle this case.

6. A correct solution would involve finding the length of one side of the square by calculating the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points, and then squaring this length to get the area.

Correctness: **False**
