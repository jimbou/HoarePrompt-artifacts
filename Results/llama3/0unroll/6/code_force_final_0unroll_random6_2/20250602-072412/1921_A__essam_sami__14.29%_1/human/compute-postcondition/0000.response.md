Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first integer input to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.

2. The value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 100, but the exact value is not specified. However, we can conclude that the stdin now contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), since the first integer `t` has been consumed by the input statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000)**
