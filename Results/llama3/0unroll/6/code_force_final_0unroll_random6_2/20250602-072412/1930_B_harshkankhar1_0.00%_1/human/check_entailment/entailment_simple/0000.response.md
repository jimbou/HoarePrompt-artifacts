Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The given program works as follows:

1. It reads the input integer n.
2. It creates a list a containing integers from 1 to n.
3. It reverses every other element in the list a, starting from the first element (index 0).
4. It prints the modified list a.

The key insight here is that by reversing every other element, the program ensures that no two adjacent elements in the list are divisible by each other. This is because the reversed elements are now in a different order, breaking the divisibility relationship.

For example, consider the input n = 4. The original list a is [1, 2, 3, 4]. After reversing every other element, the list becomes [4, 1, 2, 3]. Now, there are no two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program's approach is correct because it effectively breaks the divisibility relationship between adjacent elements, satisfying the problem's condition.

Correctness: **True**
