Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (greater than 0) with every other element reversed, stdin contains multiple lines each containing a single integer (greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10^5)**

The first line assigns a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (greater than 0) to `a`. The second line reverses every other element in the list `a`. The input integer is removed from stdin, leaving multiple lines each containing a single integer (greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10^5).
