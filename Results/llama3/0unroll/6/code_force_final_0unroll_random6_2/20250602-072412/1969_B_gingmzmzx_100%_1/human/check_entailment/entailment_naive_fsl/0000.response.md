Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

The issue lies in the way the program is calculating the cost. It is not considering the optimal way to sort the string, which is to cyclically shift the substring "10" to get "01". This operation has a cost of 2, but the program is counting it as 2 separate operations, each with a cost of 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the cost of the optimal operations. One possible approach is to use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum cost.
