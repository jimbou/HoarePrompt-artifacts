Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and calculates the number of zeroes in the string using the `count` method.
3. It then initializes two counters, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]`, to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
4. The program then iterates over the string `s`. For each character `c`, it increments the corresponding counter `cnt[c]`.
5. If the current character is 0, it checks if the count of ones is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the answer by 1. This is because a cyclic shift is needed to move the 0 to the correct position.
6. If the current character is 1, it calculates the difference between the total number of zeroes and the count of zeroes encountered so far. This difference represents the number of zeroes that need to be moved to the correct position. It adds this difference to the answer.
7. Finally, the program prints the calculated answer for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
