The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned to `n`. So, stdin now contains t binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).**
