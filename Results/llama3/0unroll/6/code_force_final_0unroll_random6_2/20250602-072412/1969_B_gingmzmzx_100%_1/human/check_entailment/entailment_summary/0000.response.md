Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The program uses a clever approach by maintaining a count of 0s and 1s and calculating the cost based on the transitions from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
