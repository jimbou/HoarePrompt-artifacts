Output State: **The loop will execute n times, and in each iteration, it will read a binary string s from the standard input, calculate the number of zeroes in the string, and then iterate over the string to calculate the answer. The answer is calculated by adding 1 to the answer if the current character is 0 and the count of 1's is greater than 0, or by adding the difference between the total number of zeroes and the count of zeroes to the answer if the current character is 1. The answer is then printed to the standard output. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The state of the variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.**
