Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals, while the `func_2` function adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

The `func_1` function first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

The `func_2` function simply calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as arguments and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, the program will allocate one tent for each group of three extroverts.
* If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the program will allocate one tent for each group of three extroverts and use the remaining extroverts and universals to fill the remaining tents.
* If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, the program will return -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
* If there are no extroverts, the program will simply allocate one tent for each introvert.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
