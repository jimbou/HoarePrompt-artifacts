Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the minimum number of tents.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as input and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. In these cases, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the participants when it's possible to do so. It takes into account the fact that each introvert needs a separate tent, each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, and each universal can be in any type of tent.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
