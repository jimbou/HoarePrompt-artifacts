Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input. It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, as input. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. In these cases, it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, and the program correctly returns -1.

In all other cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. The use of the ceiling function in `func_1` ensures that the number of tents is rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is necessary because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
