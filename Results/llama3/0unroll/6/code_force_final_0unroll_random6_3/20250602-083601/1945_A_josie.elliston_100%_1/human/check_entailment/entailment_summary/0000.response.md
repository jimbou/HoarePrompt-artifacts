Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input and returns either None or the ceiling of their sum divided by 3. If the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of calling func_1 with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the wishes by returning -1. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
