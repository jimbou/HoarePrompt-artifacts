Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. We have three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals. Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone, each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others, and each universal is fine with any option.

The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the universals. If not, it returns `None`.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the total minimum number of tents needed. It first calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that it is impossible to accommodate the participants, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` and returns the total.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants, such as when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
