This function performs a binary search on a tree data structure with n vertices to find the smallest value of x such that a given condition func_3(tree, n, k, x) is True. It takes as input a tree, a positive integer n, and a non-negative integer k less than n, and returns the smallest value of x that satisfies the condition.
