Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program defines a Tree class and several functions to perform the necessary operations. The `func_1` function performs a post-order traversal of the tree, calculating the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. The `func_2` function is a recursive version of `func_1`. The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition. The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the answer.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of good components is greater than k, and it also correctly handles the case where the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x.

After carefully examining the code and the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
