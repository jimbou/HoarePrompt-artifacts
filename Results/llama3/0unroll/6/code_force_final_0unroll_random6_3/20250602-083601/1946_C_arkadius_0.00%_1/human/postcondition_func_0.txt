This function takes a tree data structure, a starting vertex, and a minimum size as input, and returns a tuple containing the number of connected components of size at least x in the subtree rooted at the starting vertex, and the total size of all connected components in the subtree rooted at the starting vertex that are smaller than x. The function traverses the tree, aggregating the number of good components and the remaining size of smaller components at each vertex, and finally returns the aggregated values for the subtree rooted at the starting vertex.
