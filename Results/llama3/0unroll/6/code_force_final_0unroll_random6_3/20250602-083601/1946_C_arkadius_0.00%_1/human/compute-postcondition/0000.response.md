Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes, stdin contains n-1 pairs of integers representing edges in the tree, with each integer in the range 1 to n.**

In this output state, the values of n and k are assigned from the input, and a Tree object with n nodes is created. The stdin still contains n-1 pairs of integers representing edges in the tree, as the code does not consume these inputs.
