Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the range of possible values for x from 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

The program then uses a recursive function (func_2) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree for a given value of x. A good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to x.

The program then uses another function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function uses the results from func_2 to determine if the number of good components is greater than or equal to k, and if the remaining size of the tree is greater than or equal to x.

The program then uses a binary search function (func_4) to find the maximum value of x for which func_3 returns True.

Finally, the program reads the input data, constructs the tree, and calls func_4 to find the maximum value of x.

The program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
