Postcondition: ***`good_components` is a list of connected components in the tree with size at least `x`, `remaining_size` is the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree with size less than `x`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, and `tree` is a tree data structure with n vertices. The number of good components is less than or equal to k. Either the number of good components is not equal to k or the remaining size is less than x.***
