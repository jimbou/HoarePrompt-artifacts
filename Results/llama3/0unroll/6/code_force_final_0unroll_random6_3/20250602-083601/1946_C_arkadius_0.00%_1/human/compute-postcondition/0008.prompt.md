You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component.
    good_components, remaining_size = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if (good_components > k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the number of good components in the tree is greater than k, where good components are connected components with size at least x, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and n is the number of vertices in the tree.
    #State: *`good_components` is a list of connected components in the tree with size at least `x`, `remaining_size` is the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree with size less than `x`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, and `tree` is a tree data structure with n vertices. The number of good components is less than or equal to k.
    if (good_components == k and remaining_size >= x) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x, where k is an integer, x is the minimum size of each connected component, and the tree has n vertices with 1 <= k < n <= 10^5.
    #State: *`good_components` is a list of connected components in the tree with size at least `x`, `remaining_size` is the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree with size less than `x`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, and `tree` is a tree data structure with n vertices. The number of good components is less than or equal to k. Either the number of good components is not equal to k or the remaining size is less than x.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that either the number of good components is not equal to k or the remaining size is less than x, where good_components is a list of connected components in the tree with size at least x, and remaining_size is the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree with size less than x.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the number of good components in the tree is greater than k, where good components are connected components with size at least x, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and n is the number of vertices in the tree.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating that the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x, where k is an integer, x is the minimum size of each connected component, and the tree has n vertices with 1 <= k < n <= 10^5.

Case_3: The program returns False, indicating that either the number of good components is not equal to k or the remaining size is less than x, where good_components is a list of connected components in the tree with size at least x, and remaining_size is the total size of the remaining connected components in the tree with size less than x.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
