Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree data structure. The problem requires finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific purpose:

- `func_1` and `func_2` are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of connected components of size at least x and the total size of all connected components in the subtree rooted at the starting vertex that are smaller than x.

- `func_3` determines if a tree can be divided into connected components of a minimum size, with a specific number of components and remaining size.

- `func_4` performs a binary search on the tree to find the smallest value of x such that a given condition `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` is True.

- `func_5` constructs a tree from the given input, performs some operation on the tree using the provided values of n and k, and ultimately returns a result.

Based on the execution summaries of these functions, it appears that the program is correctly implemented to solve the problem. The functions work together to traverse the tree, calculate the required values, and perform the necessary operations to find the maximum number x.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
