Output: **The tree object contains a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, where each edge is represented by a pair of integers in the range 0 to n-1, and the values of n and k remain unchanged. The root of the tree is now set to 0, and the parent of the root node is set to -1, and the result of the function func_4 applied to the tree object, n and k is being printed**
