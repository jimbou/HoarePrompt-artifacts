Output State: **The tree object contains a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, where each edge is represented by a pair of integers in the range 0 to n-1, and the values of n and k remain unchanged. The root of the tree is now set to 0, and the parent of the root node is set to -1.**

In natural language, the code `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` sets the root of the tree to node 0 and sets the parent of the root node to -1 (indicating that it has no parent), without changing the values of n and k. The tree structure remains the same, with n nodes and n-1 edges.
