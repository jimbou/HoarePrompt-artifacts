This function calculates and returns the total number of "good components" and the total "remaining size" in a subtree of a given tree data structure, rooted at a specified vertex v, considering a threshold value x. The function traverses the subtree, recursively evaluating each child of v, and accumulates the good components and remaining sizes based on whether the subtree sizes meet or exceed the threshold x. The original tree structure remains unchanged.
