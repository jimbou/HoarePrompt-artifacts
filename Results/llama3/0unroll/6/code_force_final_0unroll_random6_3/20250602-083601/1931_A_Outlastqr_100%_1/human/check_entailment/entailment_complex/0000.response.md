Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded word `n` and constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded.
3. The program uses the correct logic to construct the word based on the value of `n`. It handles the cases where `n` is greater than 52, between 27 and 52, equal to 27, and less than 27 correctly.
4. The program uses the `alphabet` string to get the correct characters for the word, and it uses string concatenation to build the word.
5. The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for the input values of `n`. The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
