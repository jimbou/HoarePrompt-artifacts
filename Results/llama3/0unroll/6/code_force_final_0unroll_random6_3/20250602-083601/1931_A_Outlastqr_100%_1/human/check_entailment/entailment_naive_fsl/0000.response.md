Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer. It handles all possible cases by considering the range of the input integer and constructing the corresponding word accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

* If the input integer `n` is greater than 52, it means that the first letter of the word must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would result in a sum less than or equal to 52). In this case, the program correctly constructs the word by taking the `n-53`th letter of the alphabet and appending 'zz'.
* If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), it means that the first letter of the word is 'a', and the second letter is determined by `n-28`. The program correctly constructs the word by appending 'a' to the `n-28`th letter of the alphabet and then appending 'z'.
* If `n` is exactly 27, the program correctly constructs the word as 'aay'.
* If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it means that the first two letters of the word are both 'a', and the third letter is determined by `n-3`. The program correctly constructs the word by appending 'aa' to the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet.

The program handles all these cases correctly and produces the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer.
