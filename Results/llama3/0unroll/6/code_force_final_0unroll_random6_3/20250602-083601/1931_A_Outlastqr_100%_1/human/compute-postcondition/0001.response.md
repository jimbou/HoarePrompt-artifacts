Output State: The loop will print out t lines, each containing a string of three characters. The string will be in the format of 'aa' followed by the nth letter of the alphabet, unless n is greater than 26, in which case it will be in the format of 'a' followed by the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'z', unless n is greater than 52, in which case it will be in the format of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. The value of t will be consumed from stdin.
