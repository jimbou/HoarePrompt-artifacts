Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks the second last character of the second string in each test case and prints 'Yes' if it is '>' and 'No' if it is '<'. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The robot's movement is determined by the arrows in the grid, and it can move left, right, down, or up before following the arrow in the current cell. Therefore, the program should check all possible paths that the robot can take, not just the second last character of the second string.

For example, consider the test case where n = 4, the first string is "><<", and the second string is ">>><". The program would print 'No' because the second last character of the second string is '<'. However, the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible paths that the robot can take.

Correctness: **False**
