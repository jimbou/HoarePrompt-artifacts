Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It only checks the direction of the arrow in the second row at index n-2, which is not sufficient to determine the reachability of the cell (2, n).

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>><>

In this case, the program will print 'No' because b[n-2] is '<'. However, the robot can still reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The program does not consider the directions of the arrows in the first row, nor does it consider the possibility of the robot moving up or down before moving right. Therefore, it is incorrect.
