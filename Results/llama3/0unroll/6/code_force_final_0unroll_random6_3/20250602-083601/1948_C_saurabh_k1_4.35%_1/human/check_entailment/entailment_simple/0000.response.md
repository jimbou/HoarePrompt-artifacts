Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The problem statement asks to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1). The robot moves in two steps: first, it moves left, right, down, or up, and then it moves along the arrow in the current cell.

The key observation is that the robot can only reach the cell (2, n) if the second last character of the second string (b) is '>'. This is because the robot needs to move right along the arrow in the second last cell to reach the last cell.

The program correctly checks this condition by comparing the second last character of the second string (b[n - 2]) with '<'. If it's '<', the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n), and the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

The program assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not need to handle any error cases.

Correctness: **True**
