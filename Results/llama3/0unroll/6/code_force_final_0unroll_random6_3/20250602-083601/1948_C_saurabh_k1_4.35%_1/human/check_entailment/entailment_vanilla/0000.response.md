Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the second last character in the second row is '<'. If it is, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The program is only checking the second last character in the second row, but it is not considering the entire path that the robot can take. The robot can move left, right, down, or up, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. This means that the robot can potentially reach the cell (2, n) even if the second last character in the second row is '<'.

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'No' because the second last character in the second row is '<'. However, the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) by moving down from (1, 1) to (2, 1), then moving right to (2, 2), then moving up to (1, 2), then moving right to (1, 3), and finally moving down to (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
