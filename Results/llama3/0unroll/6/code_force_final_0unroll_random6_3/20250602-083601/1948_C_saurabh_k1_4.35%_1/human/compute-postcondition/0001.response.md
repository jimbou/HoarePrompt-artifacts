Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks the second last character of the second string in each test case and prints 'Yes' if it is '>' and 'No' if it is '<'. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified at the beginning of the input.**
