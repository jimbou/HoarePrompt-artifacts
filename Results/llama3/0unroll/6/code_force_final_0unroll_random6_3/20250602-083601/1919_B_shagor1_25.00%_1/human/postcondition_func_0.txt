This function reads a test case from standard input, consisting of an integer n and a string s of length n containing '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates the difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of '-' characters in the string, unless the number of '-' characters equals the total number of characters, in which case it returns the total number of characters. The result is printed to the console.
