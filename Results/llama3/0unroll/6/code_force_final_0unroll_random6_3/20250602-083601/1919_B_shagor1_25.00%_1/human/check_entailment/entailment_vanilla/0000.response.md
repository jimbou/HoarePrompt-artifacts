Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and enters a while loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()`.

3. The function `func_1()` reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

4. It then initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which is used to count the number of '-' characters in the string.

5. The program then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '-', it increments the `neg` counter.

6. After counting the '-' characters, the program calculates the minimum possible penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it uses `n`. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, which results in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters multiplied by the length of the array.

7. Finally, the program prints the calculated minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
