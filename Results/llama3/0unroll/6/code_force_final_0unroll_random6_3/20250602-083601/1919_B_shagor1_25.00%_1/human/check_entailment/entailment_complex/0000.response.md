Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
2. In each iteration of the loop, the program reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. The program then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
4. The program then calculates the minimum possible penalty by printing `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This is the correct calculation based on the problem description.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays `b_i` are split such that each `b_i` has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, except possibly for one `b_i` which may have one more '+' or '-' character. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so splitting the array into smaller subarrays with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters minimizes the penalty.

The program's calculation `n - 2 * neg` is correct because it calculates the difference between the total number of characters and twice the number of '-' characters. This is equivalent to calculating the number of '+' characters minus the number of '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The special case `n != neg` is handled correctly by printing `n` when `n == neg`, because in this case the minimum possible penalty is simply the length of the string.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
