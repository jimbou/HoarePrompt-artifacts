Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the string and then subtracting twice the count of negative signs from the total length of the string. This is because the penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is the difference between the number of positive signs and the number of negative signs.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the string consists only of positive signs (in which case the penalty is the length of the string), the case where the string consists only of negative signs (in which case the penalty is also the length of the string), and the case where the string contains both positive and negative signs (in which case the penalty is the difference between the length of the string and twice the count of negative signs).

The program also handles the edge case where the length of the string is equal to the count of negative signs, in which case the penalty is the length of the string.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
