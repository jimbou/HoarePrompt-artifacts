Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

The program then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` are split such that each array has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of an array with equal '+' and '-' characters is 0.

The program calculates the minimum possible penalty by printing `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`, and `n` otherwise. This is correct because:

* If `n != neg`, it means that the string `s` has more '+' characters than '-' characters. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the string into arrays with equal '+' and '-' characters, except for one array that has only '+' characters. The penalty of this array is `n - 2 * neg`, because it has `n - neg` '+' characters and `neg` '-' characters.
* If `n == neg`, it means that the string `s` has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the string into arrays with equal '+' and '-' characters. The penalty of each array is 0, so the total penalty is `n`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
