The code prints the value of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if the length of the string `s` is not equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, otherwise it prints the length of the string `s`. 

Where `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-".

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000, neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-")**
