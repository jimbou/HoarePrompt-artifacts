Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and then subtracting twice this count from the total number of characters. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum of the array, and the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the array. By subtracting twice the count of '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the absolute value of the sum. If the number of '-' characters equals the total number of characters, the program returns the total number of characters, which is the correct penalty in this case.

Correctness: **True**
