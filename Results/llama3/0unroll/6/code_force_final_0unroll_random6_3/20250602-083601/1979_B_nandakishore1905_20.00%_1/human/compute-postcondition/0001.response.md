Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two distinct non-negative integers. It calculates and prints the result for each test case based on the absolute difference between the two integers. The result is either the absolute difference itself, 1, 2, or the absolute difference minus 2 to the power of the second-to-last bit position in the binary representation of the absolute difference. The function outputs the results for all test cases in the same order as the input.**
