Output State: **The output state will contain the results of the loop's execution for each test case. For each test case, the output will be the result of the calculations performed inside the loop, which depends on the values of n and m. Specifically, the output will be either the absolute difference between n and m (k), 1, 2, or k minus 2 to the power of (p-1), where p is the length of the binary representation of k. The output state will contain these results for each test case, in the same order as the input test cases.**
