Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The function func_1 checks for each position i in the strings whether a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i]. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. If no such position is found after checking all positions, it returns 'NO', indicating that no such template t exists.

The function func_2 reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It also handles edge cases, such as when the strings are of length 1 or when the strings are identical.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
