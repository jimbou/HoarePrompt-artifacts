Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The given program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. It iterates over the range of `n` and checks if the characters at the current index `i` in strings `a` and `b` are different from the character at the same index `i` in string `c`. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `'YES'`. If it doesn't find any such case after iterating over the entire range, it returns `'NO'`.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the `results` list. Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly checks if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
