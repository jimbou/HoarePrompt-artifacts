Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes four parameters: n, a, b, and c, where n is the length of the strings a, b, and c. It compares the characters of strings a, b, and c at each position. If it finds at least one position where both a and b differ from c, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

func_2 is the main function that reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calls func_1 with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the results list.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program is correct. The func_1 function correctly checks if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The func_2 function correctly reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
