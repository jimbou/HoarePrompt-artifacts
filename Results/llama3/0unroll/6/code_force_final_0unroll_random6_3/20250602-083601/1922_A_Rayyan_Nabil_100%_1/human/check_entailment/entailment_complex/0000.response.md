Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given Python program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 compares three strings (a, b, and c) of equal length (n) and returns 'YES' if it finds at least one position where both a and b differ from c, otherwise it returns 'NO'. This function correctly implements the condition for the template t to exist.

Func_2 reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It calls func_1 with the input values and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the results list.

The program correctly implements the problem description. The func_1 function correctly checks for the existence of a template t, and the func_2 function correctly reads input, processes it, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
