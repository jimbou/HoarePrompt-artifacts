Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of a, b, and c is equal to n.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: If there exists at least one index i such that a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], then the output state is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output state is the initial state with no changes.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares three strings (a, b, and c) of equal length (n) and returns 'YES' if it finds at least one position where both a and b differ from c, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input strings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer equal to the input value, n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list of t elements, each element being the output of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the corresponding iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, printing each element of the results list. The values of t, n, a, b, and c remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the elements of the results list have been printed to the console.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function then calls another function, func_1, with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the results list. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output based on the func_1 function calls.
