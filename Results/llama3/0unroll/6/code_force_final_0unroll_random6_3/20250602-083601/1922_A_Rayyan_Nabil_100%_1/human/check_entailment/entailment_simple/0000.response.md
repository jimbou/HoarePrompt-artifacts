Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program uses a simple iterative approach to check if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i]. If such an index is found, the program returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. The function func_1 correctly checks for the existence of a template t and returns the appropriate result. The function func_2 correctly reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
