You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer equal to the input value, n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, results is a list of t elements, each element being the output of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the corresponding iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, printing each element of the results list. The values of t, n, a, b, and c remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the elements of the results list have been printed to the console.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
