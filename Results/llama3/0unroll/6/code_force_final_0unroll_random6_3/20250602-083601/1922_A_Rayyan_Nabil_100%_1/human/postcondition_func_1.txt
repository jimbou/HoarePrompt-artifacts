This function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function then calls another function, func_1, with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the results list. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output based on the func_1 function calls.
