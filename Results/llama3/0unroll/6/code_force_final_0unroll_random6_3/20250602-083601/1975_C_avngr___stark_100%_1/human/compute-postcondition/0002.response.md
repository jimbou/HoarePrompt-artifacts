Functionality: **The function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum middle element of every subarray of length 3 and prints this value. If the length of the array is 2, it prints the minimum element instead. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results without modifying the input values.**
