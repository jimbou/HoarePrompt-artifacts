stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 500) is given in the first line of stdin.
