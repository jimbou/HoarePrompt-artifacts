The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of stdin contains the number of test cases t. This integer is assigned to the variable t. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, we won't include it in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
