Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book `nums`.
3. It sorts the list of pages in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` argument. This ensures that the two largest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
4. It prints the sum of the two largest numbers, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
