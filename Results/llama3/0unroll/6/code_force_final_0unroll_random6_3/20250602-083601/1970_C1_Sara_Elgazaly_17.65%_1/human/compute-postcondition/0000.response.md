Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with no keys, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.**

The first line assigns the values of the first two integers from stdin to x and y, respectively. Since the precondition states that the first two integers are n and t, where n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 and t is 1, x becomes an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, and y becomes 1. The second line creates an empty dictionary called lst. No other variables are affected. The remaining inputs in stdin are not modified by the code.
