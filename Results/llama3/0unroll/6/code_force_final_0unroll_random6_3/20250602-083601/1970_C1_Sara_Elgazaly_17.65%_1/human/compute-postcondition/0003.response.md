Output State: **x is the last non-empty node in the graph, y is the last node popped from the list of adjacent nodes, lst remains unchanged except for the nodes that were popped, and s is False if the graph has an even number of nodes and True if it has an odd number of nodes.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

After the loop finishes executing, the value of `x` will be the last non-empty node in the graph, which is the node that has no adjacent nodes left to visit. The value of `y` will be the last node that was popped from the list of adjacent nodes of `x`. The dictionary `lst` will remain unchanged except for the nodes that were popped from the lists of adjacent nodes. The variable `s` will be `False` if the graph has an even number of nodes and `True` if it has an odd number of nodes. This is because the loop toggles the value of `s` in each iteration, and the number of iterations is equal to the number of nodes in the graph.
