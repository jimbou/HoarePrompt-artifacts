Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with `x-1` keys each containing a list of adjacent nodes, `s` is `True`, stdin contains one integer `u_1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains between 2 and 2*10^5, `y` is still 1, the dictionary `lst` still contains `x-1` keys with lists of adjacent nodes, and a new variable `s` is introduced with the value `True`. The stdin still contains one integer `u_1`.
