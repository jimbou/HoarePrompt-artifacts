Postcondition: **The loop will iterate `t` times, and for each iteration, it will count the number of 'A's and 'B's in the input string `s`. The variables `ac` and `bc` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the current string `s` after the inner loop finishes. The input string `s` will be consumed and will not be available after the inner loop finishes. The value of `t` will remain unchanged. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes. If the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.**
