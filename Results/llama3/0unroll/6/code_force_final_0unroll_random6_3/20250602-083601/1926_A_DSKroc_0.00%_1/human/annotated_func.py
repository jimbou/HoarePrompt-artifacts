#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 32) followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: The loop will iterate `t` times, and for each iteration, it will count the number of 'A's and 'B's in the input string `s`. The variables `ac` and `bc` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the current string `s` after the inner loop finishes. The input string `s` will be consumed and will not be available after the inner loop finishes. The value of `t` will remain unchanged. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: The loop will iterate `t` times, and for each iteration, it will count the number of 'A's and 'B's in the input string `s`. The variables `ac` and `bc` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the current string `s` after the inner loop finishes. The input string `s` will be consumed and will not be available after the inner loop finishes. The value of `t` will remain unchanged. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes. If the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. For each string, it counts the number of 'A's and 'B's and prints 'A' if the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function iterates t times, consuming all input strings and leaving the standard input empty.
