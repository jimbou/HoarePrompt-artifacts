Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. For each string, it counts the number of 'A's and 'B's and prints 'A' if the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function iterates t times, consuming all input strings and leaving the standard input empty.**
