Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such cases, the program will always print 'B', whereas the problem description does not specify what to do in such cases. The program should either handle this case explicitly or raise an error.

For example, if the input string is "AABBB", the program will print 'B', but it's not clear if this is the correct output according to the problem description.
