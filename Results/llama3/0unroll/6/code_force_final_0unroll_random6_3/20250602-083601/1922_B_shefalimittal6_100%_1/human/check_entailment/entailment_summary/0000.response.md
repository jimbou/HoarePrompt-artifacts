Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The program first counts the frequency of each stick length and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with at least two sticks having the same length. The program also handles the case where all three sticks have the same length.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas for calculating the number of combinations. The use of the `cnt` variable to keep track of the total count of sticks processed so far is also correct.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
