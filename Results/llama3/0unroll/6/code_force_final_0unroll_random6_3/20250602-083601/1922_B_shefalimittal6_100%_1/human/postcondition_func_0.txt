This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the number of ways to choose three distinct numbers from the given integers, with the constraint that at least two of the chosen numbers must be equal. The function returns a list of strings, where each string represents the result of each test case. The results are then printed to the console, one result per line.
