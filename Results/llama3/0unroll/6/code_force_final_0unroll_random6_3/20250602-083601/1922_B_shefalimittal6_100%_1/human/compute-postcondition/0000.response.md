Output State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of strings representing the input data, idx is 1, t is an integer representing the number of test cases, results is an empty list**.

Explanation:
The code reads the entire input from stdin and stores it in the `data` variable as a list of strings. The `idx` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1 after reading the first integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. The state of stdin is now empty since all input data has been read.
