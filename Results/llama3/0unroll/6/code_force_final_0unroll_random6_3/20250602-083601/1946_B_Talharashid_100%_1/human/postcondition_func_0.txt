This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the maximum subarray sum for each test case, then prints the result of the formula (2^k * maximum subarray sum - maximum subarray sum + sum of all elements) modulo 1000000007 for each test case.
