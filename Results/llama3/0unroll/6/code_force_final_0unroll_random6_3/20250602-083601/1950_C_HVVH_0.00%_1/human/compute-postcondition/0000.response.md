Output State: **day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable n. Since the input is an integer between 1 and 1440, n becomes an integer between 1 and 1440. The input is consumed, leaving t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format in stdin.
