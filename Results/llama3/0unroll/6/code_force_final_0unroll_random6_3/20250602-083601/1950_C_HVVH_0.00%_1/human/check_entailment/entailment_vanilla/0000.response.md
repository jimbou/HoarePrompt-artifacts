Reasoning:

1. The problem requires converting a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The given Python program attempts to do this.

2. The program first sets the day to 'AM'. Then, it reads the number of test cases (n) and iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format, splits it into hours (h) and minutes (m), and converts them to integers.

4. If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'. 

5. However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is between 1 and 11 (inclusive), the program sets the day to 'PM', which is incorrect. It should set the day to 'AM' for hours between 1 and 11.

6. The program then prints the time in 12-hour format with the day.

7. Despite the logical error, the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs. However, this is due to the specific example inputs and not because the program is correct.

8. To fix the program, the condition for setting the day to 'AM' or 'PM' should be corrected. The correct condition is: if the hour is between 1 and 11 (inclusive), set the day to 'AM'; if the hour is 12, set the day to 'PM'; if the hour is between 13 and 23 (inclusive), subtract 12 from the hour and set the day to 'PM'.

9. The corrected program would be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Correctness: **False**
