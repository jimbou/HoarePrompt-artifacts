Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM", but it should output "12:00 PM". This is because the program incorrectly sets the day to 'AM' when the hour is 12.

Additionally, the program has a logical error in the line `else: day = 'PM'; if h == 12: day = 'AM'`. This line is unnecessary and can be removed. The correct logic is to set the day to 'AM' if the hour is 0 or 12, and to 'PM' otherwise.

A corrected version of the program would be:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```
