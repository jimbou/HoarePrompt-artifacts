Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a 24-hour time format to a 12-hour time format. The program correctly handles the conversion of hours and minutes, and it also correctly determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon/evening (PM).

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the else block, the program sets day to 'PM' and then checks if h is equal to 12. If h is equal to 12, it sets day to 'AM'. This is incorrect because 12:xx is PM, not AM.

Correctness: **False**
