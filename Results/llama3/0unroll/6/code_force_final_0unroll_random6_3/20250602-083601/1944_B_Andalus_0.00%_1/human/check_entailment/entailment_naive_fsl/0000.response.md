Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input list contains duplicate elements that are not consecutive. In this case, the program will not correctly identify the duplicate elements and will not print the correct subsets.

For example, if the input is:

4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

The program will print:

1 2
1 2

However, the correct output should be:

1 2
1 2

or

3 4
3 4

The program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks for consecutive duplicate elements in the input list. It does not consider the case where duplicate elements are not consecutive.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
