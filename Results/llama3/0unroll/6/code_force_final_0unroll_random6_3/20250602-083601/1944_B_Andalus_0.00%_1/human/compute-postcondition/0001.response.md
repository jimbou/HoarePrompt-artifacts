Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers in each line are pairs of identical numbers from the left half of the input list, followed by single numbers from the left half that do not have a pair, followed by pairs of identical numbers from the right half of the input list, and finally single numbers from the right half that do not have a pair. The numbers are printed in ascending order within each half. The number of lines is equal to the number of test cases T.**
