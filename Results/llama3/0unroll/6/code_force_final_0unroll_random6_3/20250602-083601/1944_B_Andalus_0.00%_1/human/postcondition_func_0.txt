The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function processes each test case by splitting the integers into two halves, sorting them, and identifying pairs of identical numbers and single numbers in each half. It then prints k integers for each test case, consisting of pairs of identical numbers from the left half, followed by single numbers from the left half, then pairs of identical numbers from the right half, and finally single numbers from the right half, all in ascending order within each half. The function repeats this process for all test cases, producing a series of lines as output.
