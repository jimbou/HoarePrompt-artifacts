Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts. In the case where A is odd and B * 2 < C, the program prints X (which is A // 2) and then X * C + B, but it should print (A // 2) * C + B instead.

For example, if the input is 3 5 11, the program will print 1 and then 1 * 11 + 5 = 16, but the correct output should be (3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 15.
