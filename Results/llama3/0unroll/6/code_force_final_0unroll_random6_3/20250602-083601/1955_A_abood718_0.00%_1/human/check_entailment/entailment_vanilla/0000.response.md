Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers: the number of yogurts (A), the price for one yogurt (B), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (C).
4. The program then checks three conditions:
   - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the promotion price (C), it prints the total cost as A * B.
   - If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it prints the total cost as A * C / 2.
   - If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts (X = A // 2), prints X (which is not necessary and seems to be a mistake), and then prints the total cost as X * C + B.
5. The program does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is 1, but since the problem statement guarantees that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, this is not a concern.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because in the last condition (when the number of yogurts is odd), it prints the value of X, which is not required. It should only print the total cost.
