The code `T = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `T`. The first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
