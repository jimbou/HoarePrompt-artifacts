Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when a = 4 and b = 5, the program prints 'Bob', but according to the problem description, Alice will win the game in this case.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly determine the winner based on the number of coins in the wallets. The program only checks for specific cases, such as when a == b, a == 1, b == 1, etc., but it does not have a general rule to determine the winner.

To correctly determine the winner, the program should check if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd or even. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win the game. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win the game. This is because the player who makes the last move will be the one who has an odd number of coins in their wallet, and since Alice makes the first move, she will have an odd number of coins in her wallet if the total number of coins is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This program correctly determines the winner based on the total number of coins in the wallets.
