Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element. If the array contains only one element or if all elements are the same, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful. It checks for the edge cases where the array contains only one element or all elements are the same, and handles them correctly.

Correctness: **True**
