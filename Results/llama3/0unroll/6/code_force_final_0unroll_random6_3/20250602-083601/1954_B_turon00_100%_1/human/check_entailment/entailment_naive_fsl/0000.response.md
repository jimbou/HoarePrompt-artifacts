Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only two distinct elements, and the minimum count of consecutive elements of the same type is 1. In this case, the program will output 1, but it should output -1 because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

For example, consider the input:

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3
    
    4
    
    1 2 1 2

The program will output:

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    1

But the correct output should be:

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    -1

Because in the last case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
