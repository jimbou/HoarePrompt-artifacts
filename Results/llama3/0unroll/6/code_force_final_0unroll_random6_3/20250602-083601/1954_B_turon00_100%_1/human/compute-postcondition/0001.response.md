Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the corresponding test case. If the first element occurs only once or if all elements in the test case are the same, the output is -1. The list has a length of `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases.**
