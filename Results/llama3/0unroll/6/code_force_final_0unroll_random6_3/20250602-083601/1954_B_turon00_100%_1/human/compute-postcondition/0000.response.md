The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value read from the standard input. The remaining input in the standard input is still present, which includes `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n).**
