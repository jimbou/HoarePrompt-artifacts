Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements themselves `a`.

3. It then initializes a variable `tmp` to the first element of the array, a counter `cnt` to 0, and a variable `ans` to `n`.

4. The program then iterates over the array. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments the counter `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

5. After iterating over the entire array, the program updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time.

6. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the program prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

7. The program repeats this process for all test cases.

The logic is correct because it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. If the first element occurs only once or if all elements are the same, it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly prints -1 in these cases. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
