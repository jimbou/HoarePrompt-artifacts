Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and k. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the binary representation of k and finds the position of the most significant bit (MSB) using the func_1 function. It then constructs the sequence by appending the value of the MSB minus 1 to the array, followed by the difference between k and the MSB minus 1, and finally n-2 zeros.

If n is 1, it simply prints k.

The func_1 function calculates the position of the MSB in the binary representation of a given number n. It does this by shifting the bits of n to the right until n becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.

The execution summary indicates that the func_1 function correctly calculates the position of the MSB in the binary representation of a given number.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly constructs a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

Correctness: **True**
