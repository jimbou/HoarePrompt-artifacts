Output State: **n is 0, position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of n.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `n` becomes 0, and the value of `position` becomes the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`. This is because the loop continues to shift the bits of `n` to the right until `n` becomes 0, and for each iteration, it increments the `position` by 1.
