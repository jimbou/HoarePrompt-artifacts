#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a list of two non-negative integers.
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, which is a negative integer.
    #State: *n is a list of two non-negative integers, and n is not equal to 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is 0, position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of n.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of n minus 1, where n is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of the input list of two non-negative integers, minus 1, unless the input list is 0, in which case it returns -1.
