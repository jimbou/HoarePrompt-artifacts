Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m.**

In this output state, `nabors` is assigned the value of the first line of the first test case, which contains three integers n, m, and k. The stdin now contains the remaining lines of the test cases, which are the lines containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m.
