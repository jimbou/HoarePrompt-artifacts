This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains m integers. It then processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each integer in the two sets of numbers, calculates the total count of common integers, and checks how many times the total count is greater than or equal to k. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of times the condition is met.
