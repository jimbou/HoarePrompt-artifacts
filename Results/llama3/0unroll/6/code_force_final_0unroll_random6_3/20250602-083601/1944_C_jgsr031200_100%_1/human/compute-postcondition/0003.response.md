Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list where the value at each index `i` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `cou` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `arr` and `freq`, remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains non-negative integers, and the list `freq` still represents the frequency of each index `i` in `arr`.
