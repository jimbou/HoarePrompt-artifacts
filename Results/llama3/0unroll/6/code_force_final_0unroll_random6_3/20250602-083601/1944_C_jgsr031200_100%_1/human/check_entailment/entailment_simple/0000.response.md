Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it in the game.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array `arr` using the `freq` list.

2. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the frequency of the current number is 0 or 1. If the frequency is 0, it means the number is not present in the array, so it prints the number and breaks the loop. If the frequency is 1, it increments the counter `cou`.

3. The loop continues until it finds a number that appears at most once in the array or until `cou` becomes 2. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will choose the smallest number that appears at most once in the array. If there are two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice will choose the smaller one, and Bob will choose the larger one.

4. The program prints the smallest number that appears at most once in the array, which is the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
