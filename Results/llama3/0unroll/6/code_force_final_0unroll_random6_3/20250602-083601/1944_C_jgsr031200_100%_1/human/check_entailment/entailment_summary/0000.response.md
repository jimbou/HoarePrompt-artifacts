Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer that appears at most once in the list, which is the MEX of the list. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the list, then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n (the size of the list). If a number appears more than once, it skips it. If a number appears exactly once, it increments a counter. If the counter reaches 2 or if a number does not appear in the list (i.e., its frequency is 0), it prints that number and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the list is the smallest number that appears at most once, and the program correctly finds and prints this number.

Correctness: **True**
