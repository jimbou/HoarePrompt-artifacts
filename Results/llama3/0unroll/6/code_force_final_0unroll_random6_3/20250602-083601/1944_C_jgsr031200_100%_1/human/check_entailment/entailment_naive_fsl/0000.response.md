Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the score by Alice and minimize the score by Bob. The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the array and then iterates through the numbers to find the smallest number that appears less than twice or does not appear at all. This number is the MEX of the array `c` and is the score of the game.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When the array contains duplicate numbers, the program correctly ignores them and continues to the next number.
* When the array contains numbers that appear only once, the program correctly counts them and stops when it finds the second number that appears only once.
* When the array contains numbers that do not appear at all, the program correctly returns the smallest such number as the score.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* When the array is empty, the program correctly returns 0 as the score.
* When the array contains only one number, the program correctly returns 0 as the score if the number appears only once, and 1 as the score if the number appears twice.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game strategy and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
