Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the elements of the array. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array.

The function `func_1` iterates over the array and increments the frequency count for each element. It then iterates over the frequency array and checks for the following conditions:

1. If the frequency of an element is greater than or equal to 2, it continues to the next element.
2. If the frequency of an element is 1, it increments a counter `cou`.
3. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency of an element is 0, it prints the current element `i` and breaks the loop.

The program then calls the `func_1` function for each test case and prints the result.

The reasoning behind the program is as follows:

* The program uses a frequency array to count the occurrences of each element in the input array.
* The program iterates over the frequency array to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array (i.e., the MEX).
* The program uses a counter `cou` to keep track of the number of elements with a frequency of 1. When `cou` is equal to 2, it means that there are at least two elements with a frequency of 1, which means that the MEX is at least 2.
* The program prints the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, which is the MEX.

Based on the reasoning, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
