Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input array `arr` and creates a frequency array `freq` where the value at each index `i` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`.

2. Then, it iterates over the frequency array from 0 to `n` (the size of the input array). For each index `i`, it checks if the frequency of `i` is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it skips to the next iteration.

3. If the frequency of `i` is 1, it increments a counter `cou` by 1.

4. If `cou` becomes 2 or if the frequency of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score. The strategy is to pick the smallest number that appears at most once in the array, because this will maximize the MEX of Alice's array. The program correctly identifies this number by iterating over the frequency array and checking the conditions mentioned above.

Correctness: **True**
