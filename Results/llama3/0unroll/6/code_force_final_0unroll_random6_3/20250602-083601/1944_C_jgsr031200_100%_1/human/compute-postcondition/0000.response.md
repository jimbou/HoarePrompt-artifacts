Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially a list of non-negative integers. The new variable `freq` is introduced, which is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a non-negative integer based on the context of the code.
