#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to satisfy the condition that there should be at least one colored cell in k diagonals. The output is calculated based on the given formula, which takes into account the values of n and k.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in each grid to satisfy the condition, based on the given formula. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.
