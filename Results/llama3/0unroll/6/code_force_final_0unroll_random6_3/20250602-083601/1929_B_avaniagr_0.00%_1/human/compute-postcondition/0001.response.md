Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in each grid to satisfy the condition, based on the given formula. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.**
