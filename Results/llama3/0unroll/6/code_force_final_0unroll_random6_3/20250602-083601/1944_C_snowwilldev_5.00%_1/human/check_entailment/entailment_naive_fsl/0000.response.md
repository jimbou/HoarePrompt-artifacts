Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. The key insight is that Alice should aim to create a situation where Bob is forced to remove an element that would otherwise be part of a consecutive sequence in Alice's array.

The program uses a frequency count of the elements in the input array `a` to determine the optimal strategy. It iterates through the possible values from 0 to N-1 and checks if the frequency count of each value is 1. If it finds a value with a frequency count of 1, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` reaches 2 or if the frequency count of a value is 0, it prints the current value `i` as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If a value has a frequency count of 1, it means that Bob can remove it, and Alice can still create a consecutive sequence up to that value.
* If `t` reaches 2, it means that there are at least two values with a frequency count of 1, and Alice can create a consecutive sequence up to the current value `i`.
* If the frequency count of a value is 0, it means that Bob has already removed all occurrences of that value, and Alice cannot create a consecutive sequence up to that value.

The program's output matches the expected output for the provided examples, and it correctly handles edge cases such as an empty input array or an array with a single element. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
