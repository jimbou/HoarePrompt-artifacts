Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program works by counting the occurrences of each number in the array and then finding the smallest number that appears only once or does not appear at all. This is because Alice can always choose the smallest number that appears only once to maximize the score, and Bob can always choose the smallest number that does not appear to minimize the score.

The program uses a defaultdict to count the occurrences of each number, which is an efficient way to handle the counting. It then iterates over the range of possible numbers (from 0 to N-1) and checks if the count of each number is 1 or 0. If it finds a number that appears only once or does not appear at all, it prints that number as the final score.

The program also handles the case where no such number exists, in which case it prints the smallest number that appears more than once. This is because if all numbers appear more than once, the MEX of the array will be the smallest number that appears more than once.

Overall, the program correctly implements the strategy for the game and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
