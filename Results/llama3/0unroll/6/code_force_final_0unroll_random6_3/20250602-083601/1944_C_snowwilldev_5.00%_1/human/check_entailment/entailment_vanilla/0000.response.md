Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The provided program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates through the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to `N-1`) and checks if the count of the current MEX value is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2 or if the count of the current MEX value is 0, it prints the current MEX value as the final score.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If the count of a MEX value is 1, it means that Alice can choose that value and Bob cannot block it. Therefore, Alice can increase the MEX value by 1.
* If the count of a MEX value is 0, it means that the value is not present in the array, and therefore, it is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, making it the MEX.
* If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, it means that Alice has already chosen two values, and Bob cannot block the next value. Therefore, the current MEX value is the final score.

The program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
