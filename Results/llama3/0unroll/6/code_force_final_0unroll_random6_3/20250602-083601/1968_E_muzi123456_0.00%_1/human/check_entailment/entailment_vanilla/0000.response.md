Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing out a series of points in the grid, where each point is of the form (1, i) for i ranging from 1 to n.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

The problem statement requires that the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances be maximized, which means that the program should output points that have the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances between them.

The given program does not achieve this because it only outputs points of the form (1, i), which means that the Manhattan distance between any two points will always be either 0 or 1. This is not sufficient to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, for n = 3, the program outputs the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). However, the Manhattan distances between these points are 0, 1, and 2, respectively, which means that the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is only 3. A better solution would be to output the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which have Manhattan distances of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, resulting in a set of distinct Manhattan distances of size 4.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
