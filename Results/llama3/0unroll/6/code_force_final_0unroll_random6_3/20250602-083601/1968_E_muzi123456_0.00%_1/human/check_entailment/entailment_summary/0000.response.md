Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by printing a series of numbers from 1 to n, with each number followed by a space.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The Manhattan distance between two cells is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates. The program's output does not take into account the y-coordinates of the cells, which are necessary to calculate the Manhattan distance.

For example, for n = 3, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A correct solution would require a more complex algorithm that takes into account the y-coordinates of the cells.

Correctness: **False**
