Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid (n). It then prints n points, where each point is of the form (1, i), where i ranges from 1 to n.

However, this solution is incorrect. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The given program only prints points of the form (1, i), which means that the Manhattan distance between any two points will always be either 0 (if the points are the same) or 1 (if the points are different). This does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, for n = 3, the program will print the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). The Manhattan distances between these points are 0, 1, and 1, respectively. However, a better solution would be to print the points (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3), which would result in Manhattan distances of 0, 2, and 4, respectively, maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
