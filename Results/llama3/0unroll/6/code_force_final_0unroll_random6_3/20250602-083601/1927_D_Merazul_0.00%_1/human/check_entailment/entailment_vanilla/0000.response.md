Reasoning:

The given Python program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j`. However, the program does not attempt to find these indices. Instead, it seems to be trying to solve a different problem.

2. The program uses a lot of unclear and confusing variable names and operations. For example, the line `(*_, k) = R()` is unclear, and the use of `*` to unpack values is not necessary here. Similarly, the line `f &= u | v` is unclear and does not seem to be related to the problem.

3. The program does not handle the input correctly. The problem states that the input will be an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries, where each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r`. However, the program does not read the input in this format.

4. The program does not output the correct results. The problem requires outputting two integers `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists. However, the program outputs a string `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`, which is not related to the problem.

5. The program does not follow the problem's constraints. The problem states that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`, and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`. However, the program does not check these constraints.

Correctness: **False**
