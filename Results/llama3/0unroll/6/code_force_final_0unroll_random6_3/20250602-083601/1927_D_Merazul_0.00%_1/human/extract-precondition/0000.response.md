Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The second integer is the number of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers. The sum of the lengths of the lists of integers across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of the numbers of pairs of integers across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
