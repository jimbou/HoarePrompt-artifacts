Reasoning:

The given Python program is incorrect. The program is trying to solve a problem where it needs to find two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. However, the program is not correctly implementing this logic.

The program is using a set `a` to store the elements of the array, and then it's using another set `b` to store the queries. It's then trying to find the intersection of these two sets, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The program is also using a variable `f` to keep track of whether the conditions are satisfied, but it's not correctly updating this variable based on the intersection of the sets.

Moreover, the program is printing a string of 'Y's and 'N's, which is not the correct output format according to the problem description. The problem description requires the program to output two integers `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if such a pair does not exist.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
