Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers. The sum of the lengths of the lists of integers across all remaining test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of the numbers of pairs of integers across all remaining test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    *_, k = R()
    a = {*R()}
    b = {*R()}
    f = 1
    m = n = k // 2
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        u = i in a
        v = i in b
        f &= u | v
        m -= u & ~v
        n -= ~u & v
    print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
