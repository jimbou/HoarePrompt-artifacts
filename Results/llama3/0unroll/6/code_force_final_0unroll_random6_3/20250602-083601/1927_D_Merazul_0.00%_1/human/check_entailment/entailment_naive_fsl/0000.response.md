Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses a set to store the elements of the array a and then checks if each query's boundaries are in the set. However, this approach does not correctly identify the indices i and j that satisfy the condition a_i ≠ a_j.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program will output:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

The program incorrectly outputs -1 -1 for the second query, when in fact the correct output should be 1 2, because a_1 ≠ a_2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
