Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers. The sum of the lengths of the lists of integers across all remaining test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of the numbers of pairs of integers across all remaining test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

The first line defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into parts separated by spaces, and converts each part into an integer. The second line uses this function to read the first input from stdin, which is the number of test cases `t`. As a result, `t` becomes an integer, and stdin now contains one less test case. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: a list of integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of integers. The constraints on the lengths of the lists of integers and the numbers of pairs of integers across all remaining test cases remain the same.
