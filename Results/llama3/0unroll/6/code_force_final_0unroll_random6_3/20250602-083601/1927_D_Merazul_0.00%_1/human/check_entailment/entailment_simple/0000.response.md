Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is trying to solve a problem where it needs to find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program is not correctly implementing this logic.

The program is using a set to store the elements of the array a, which is not necessary and is also incorrect because it does not preserve the order of the elements. It is also using a set to store the queries, which is also incorrect because it does not preserve the order of the queries.

The program is also using a variable f to keep track of whether the conditions are satisfied, but it is not correctly updating this variable. It is also using variables m and n to keep track of the number of elements in the array a that are less than or equal to k/2, but it is not correctly updating these variables.

The program is also printing 'Y' or 'N' based on the value of f, but it is not correctly printing the indices i and j.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
