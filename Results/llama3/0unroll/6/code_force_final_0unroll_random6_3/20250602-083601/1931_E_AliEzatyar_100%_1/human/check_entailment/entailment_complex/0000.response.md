Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the input array.
2. It identifies the numbers with trailing zeros and stores them in the `zeros` list.
3. The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order, which is correct because Anna will try to remove the maximum number of zeros on her turns.
4. The program then calculates the total number of zeros that will be removed by Anna, which is the sum of every other element in the `zeros` list, starting from the first element (index 0).
5. The program checks if the total number of digits minus the number of zeros removed by Anna is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The function `func_1` is also correct, as it counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer input.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description and the input values.

Correctness: **True**
