Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The program correctly counts the total number of digits in the input list, identifies the trailing zeros in each number, and simulates the game by subtracting the trailing zeros in an alternating manner (Anna's turns). The final result is then compared to the target value (10^m) to determine the winner.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each number, which is a correct implementation. The main logic of the program is also correct, as it simulates the game by alternating between Anna's turns (subtracting trailing zeros) and Sasha's turns (concatenating numbers).

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
