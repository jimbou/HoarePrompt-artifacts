Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4), `counter` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains the same as in the initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The code introduces a new variable `counter` and assigns it the value 0. The value of `num` is not affected by the code, so it retains its original range.
