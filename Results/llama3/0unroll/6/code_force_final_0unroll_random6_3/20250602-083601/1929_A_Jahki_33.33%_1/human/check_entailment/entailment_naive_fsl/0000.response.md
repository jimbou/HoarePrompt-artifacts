Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. However, this function is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input array is `[3, 2, 1]`, the `func_1` function will return `True` because the array is not sorted in ascending order. However, the program will then calculate the beauty of the array as if it were sorted, which is incorrect.

The correct approach is to simply sort the array and calculate the beauty without checking if the array is already sorted. The `func_1` function can be removed, and the program will work correctly for all potential cases.

Here is the corrected code:
```
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```
This code correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
