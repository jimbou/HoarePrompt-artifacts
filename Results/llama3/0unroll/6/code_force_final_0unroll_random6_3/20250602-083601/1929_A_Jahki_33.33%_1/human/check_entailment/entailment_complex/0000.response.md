Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already in a strictly increasing order using the function `func_1`. If the array is already in a strictly increasing order, it prints 0 as the beauty of the array. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing by iterating through the array and checking if each element is greater than the previous one. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, it increments the `order` variable. If the `order` variable is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means that the array is strictly increasing and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks if the array is already in a strictly increasing order and if not, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty of the array. The function `func_1` is also correct in checking if the array is strictly increasing.

Correctness: **True**
