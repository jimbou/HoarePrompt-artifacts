#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, num2 is a non-negative integer and equals to the length of the list a.
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `num2` is a non-negative integer and equals to the length of the list `a`, `order` is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that there are no pairs of adjacent elements in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, and the length of the list `a` is equal to the non-negative integer `num2`.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a list of integers is strictly increasing, meaning that each element is greater than the previous one. It takes a list of integers and its length as input, and returns True if the list is strictly increasing and False otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.
