Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the function `func_1`. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0 as the beauty of the array.

If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted by iterating over the elements and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds any pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, it returns False. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns True.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks if the array is already sorted and calculates the beauty of the array if it's not sorted. The function `func_1` is also correct in checking if the array is sorted.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet. It is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. If the function is not defined correctly, the program will not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
