Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program takes the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements as input.

The program first checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the `func_1` function. If it is, the program prints 0, as no rearrangement is needed to maximize the beauty.

If the array is not in strictly increasing order, the program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing, and the main program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, as the program can simply sort the array and calculate the beauty without checking if the array is already in strictly increasing order. The `func_1` function is redundant and can be removed.

Despite this minor issue, the program is correct and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
