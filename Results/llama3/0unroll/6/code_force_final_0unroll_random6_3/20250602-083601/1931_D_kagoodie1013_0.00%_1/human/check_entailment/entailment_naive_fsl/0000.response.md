Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when x and y are both 1. In this case, the program will count each pair of numbers twice, once for the sum being divisible by x and once for the difference being divisible by y. However, the problem statement only considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n ) beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. When x and y are both 1, this condition is always true for any pair of numbers, but the program will count each pair twice.

For example, if the input is:

    3 1 1
    1 2 3

The program will output 6, but the correct output should be 3.
