The code creates an empty list called `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` is not affected by this code, as it only creates a new variable `results` and does not modify any existing variables.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is a list of three integers n, x, and y, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. `results` is an empty list.**
