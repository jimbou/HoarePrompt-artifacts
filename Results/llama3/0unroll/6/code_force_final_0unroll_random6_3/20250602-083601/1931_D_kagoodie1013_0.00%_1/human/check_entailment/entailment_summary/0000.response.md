Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, and the sum of the elements at these indices is divisible by x, and the difference of the elements at these indices is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary to store the count of elements with the same remainder when divided by x and y. It then iterates over the array, updating the count of beautiful pairs for each element.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is currently counting the pairs where `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, which is not the correct condition for a beautiful pair. The correct condition is `a_i + a_j` is divisible by x and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by y.

To fix this error, the program should be modified to count the pairs where `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`. This can be achieved by using two dictionaries, one to store the count of elements with the same remainder when divided by x, and another to store the count of elements with the same remainder when divided by y.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get((x - mod_x) % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get((mod_y + y // 2) % y, 0)
            mod_x_map[mod_x] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + 1
        results.append(count // 2) # divide by 2 to avoid counting each pair twice
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
