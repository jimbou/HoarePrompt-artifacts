This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It calculates the total count of pairs of numbers in each test case that satisfy the conditions `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, where `a_i` and `a_j` are elements in the array. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case, without modifying the input test cases.
