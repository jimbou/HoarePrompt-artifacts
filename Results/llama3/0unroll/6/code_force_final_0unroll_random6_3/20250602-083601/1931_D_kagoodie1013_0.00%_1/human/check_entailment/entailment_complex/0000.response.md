Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array, where a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

However, the program calculates the count of pairs of numbers that satisfy the conditions a_i % x == a_j % x and a_i % y != a_j % y, which is not the same as the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The program incorrectly uses the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of the sum and difference of pairs of numbers, which does not guarantee that the sum and difference are divisible by x and y, respectively.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and its output may not match the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
