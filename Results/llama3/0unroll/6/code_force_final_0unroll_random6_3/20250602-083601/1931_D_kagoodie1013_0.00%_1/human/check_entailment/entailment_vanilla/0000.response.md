Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary to store the count of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and checks if there are any numbers in the dictionary that have the same remainder when divided by x and y. If there are, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is currently counting the pairs where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y, but it is not considering the condition that i < j. This means that the program is counting each pair twice, once for (i, j) and once for (j, i).

To fix this error, the program should only count the pairs where i < j. This can be done by only incrementing the count when the remainder of a_i + a_j divided by x is equal to the remainder of a_j - a_i divided by y, and not when the remainder of a_i + a_j divided by x is equal to the remainder of a_i - a_j divided by y.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get((x - mod_x) % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get((y + mod_y) % y, 0)
            mod_x_map[mod_x] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
