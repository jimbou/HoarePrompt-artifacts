Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a complete undirected graph with n vertices, where (n - 2) edges have been removed. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to query the graph and obtain information about the vertices and their degrees.

The main function `func_2` uses a loop to iterate over the remaining vertices and queries the graph using `func_1` to determine the next vertex to add to the path. The loop continues until all vertices have been added to the path.

The program's correctness can be analyzed as follows:

1.  The program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph. It uses a greedy approach to select the next vertex to add to the path, based on the degree of the vertices and the connectivity information obtained from the queries.
2.  The program correctly handles the case where a vertex has a degree of 0, in which case it is not connected to any other vertex. In this case, the program simply adds the vertex to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
3.  The program correctly handles the case where a vertex has a degree greater than 0, in which case it is connected to at least one other vertex. In this case, the program adds the vertex to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices, and then uses the connectivity information to determine the next vertex to add to the path.
4.  The program correctly prints the final Hamiltonian path in the required format.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
