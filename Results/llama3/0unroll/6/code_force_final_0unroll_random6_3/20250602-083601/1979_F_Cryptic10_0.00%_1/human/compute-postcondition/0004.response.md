Output State: **path contains a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in non-increasing order, remaining_vertices is an empty set, and this is printed: "! [path]" where path is the sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in non-increasing order, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed, meaning that any pending output has been written to the console. The values of the variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
