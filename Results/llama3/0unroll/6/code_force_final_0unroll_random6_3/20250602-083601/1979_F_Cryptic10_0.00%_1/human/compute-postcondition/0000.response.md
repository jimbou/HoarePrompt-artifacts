Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes a non-negative integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**

In this output state, the initial values of `n` and `func_1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables: `path` and `remaining_vertices`. The `path` variable is initialized as an empty list, indicating that it will be used to store a sequence of values, but currently, it contains no elements. The `remaining_vertices` variable is initialized as a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which suggests that it will be used to keep track of vertices in a graph or a similar data structure that are yet to be processed or visited.
