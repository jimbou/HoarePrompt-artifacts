The code prints a string that starts with an exclamation mark (!) followed by the elements of the path list, separated by spaces.
The path list contains a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in non-increasing order.
Output: **! [n] [n-1] [n-2] ... [2] [1] (where n is the last element of the path list)**
