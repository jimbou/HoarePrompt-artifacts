Functionality: **The function generates a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in non-increasing order and prints it. It uses a helper function `func_1` to determine the next integer in the sequence, and it continues until all integers from 1 to n have been included in the sequence. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the generated sequence and flushes the output buffer.**
