Output State: **path contains a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in non-increasing order, remaining_vertices is an empty set.**

In this output state, the loop has iterated over all the vertices from 1 to n, and for each vertex, it has found a pair (v, u) using the function func_1(d) such that v is in the remaining_vertices set. The vertex v is then added to the path list and removed from the remaining_vertices set. This process continues until all vertices have been processed, resulting in an empty remaining_vertices set and a path list containing all the vertices in non-increasing order.
