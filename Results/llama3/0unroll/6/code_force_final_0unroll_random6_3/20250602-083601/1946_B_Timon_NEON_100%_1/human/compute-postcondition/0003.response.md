Output State: **segments_variants is a list containing two lists: the first list contains the maximum segment and the last index of the array, and the second list contains the new segment and the last index of the array; total_max_segment is a list containing a single element, -1.**

In this output state, the code has appended two new lists to the segments_variants list. The first list contains the maximum segment (max_segment) and the last index of the array (len(arr) - 1), while the second list contains the new segment (new_segment) and the last index of the array. The total_max_segment list remains unchanged, still containing a single element, -1.
