Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. However, func_3 is not fully implemented, and it seems to be the main function that should solve the problem.

func_1 is a simple function that takes a number and returns the remainder of the number divided by 1000000007. This function is likely used to handle the modulo operation required in the problem.

func_2 is a function that takes an array as input and returns the maximum contiguous subarray with a positive sum. This function seems to be an attempt to solve the problem, but it is not fully correct. The function tries to find the maximum contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum and the corresponding subarray. However, the function has several issues:

1.  The function does not handle the case where the maximum contiguous subarray has a negative sum. In this case, the function should return an empty subarray or handle it differently.
2.  The function does not consider the case where the maximum contiguous subarray is the entire array. In this case, the function should return the entire array.
3.  The function does not handle the case where the input array is empty. In this case, the function should return an empty subarray or handle it differently.

func_3 is not fully implemented, and it seems to be the main function that should solve the problem. However, without the complete implementation, it is difficult to determine its correctness.

Overall, the given program is not fully correct, and it has several issues that need to be addressed.

Correctness: **False**
