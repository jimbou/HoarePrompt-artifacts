Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the maximum sum. `func_1` simply returns the remainder of the input number when divided by 1000000007, which is not relevant to the problem. `func_2` finds the maximum segment of consecutive non-negative integers in the input array, but it does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of a subarray anywhere in the array.

The program also uses a variable `max_segment` to store the maximum segment found by `func_2`, but it does not correctly update this variable. The program also uses a variable `answer` to store the final result, but it does not correctly calculate this value.

Furthermore, the program does not consider the case where the input array contains only negative numbers, in which case the maximum sum would be the sum of the entire array.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
