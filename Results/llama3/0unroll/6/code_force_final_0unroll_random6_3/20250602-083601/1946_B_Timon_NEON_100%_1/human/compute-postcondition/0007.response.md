Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum segment of consecutive non-negative integers, along with the last index of the array. The function iterates through the input list, identifying segments of non-negative integers and keeping track of the maximum segment found so far. If a segment ends with a negative integer, it is added to the list of segments and a new segment is started. The function returns the maximum segment found, along with the last index of the array, while keeping the list of all segments unchanged.**
