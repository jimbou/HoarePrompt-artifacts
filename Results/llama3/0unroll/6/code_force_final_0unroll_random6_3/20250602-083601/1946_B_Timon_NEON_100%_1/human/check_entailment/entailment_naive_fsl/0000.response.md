Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program has several issues:

1. The `func_2` function is supposed to find the maximum segment in the array, but it does not correctly handle the case where the maximum segment is at the beginning or end of the array.

2. The `func_3` function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations, but it is not implemented correctly. It does not take into account the maximum segment found by `func_2` and does not correctly calculate the sum after k operations.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains negative numbers. In this case, the maximum possible sum may not be achieved by simply inserting the sum of the maximum segment k times.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where k is greater than the length of the array. In this case, the maximum possible sum may not be achieved by simply inserting the sum of the maximum segment k times.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains zeros. In this case, the maximum possible sum may not be achieved by simply inserting the sum of the maximum segment k times.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem and does not handle all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
