#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.

    #State: The output state is a series of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the indices of the two occurrences of the same integer in the input array. The pairs are printed in the order they appear in the input array, and the output is formatted such that each pair is separated by a space, and each pair is on a new line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the input data, printing pairs of indices of the same integer in the input array, with the pairs separated by spaces and each pair on a new line. The function handles cases where the number of pairs to be printed is less than k, and also handles cases where the number of pairs to be printed is equal to k. The function prints the pairs in the order they appear in the input array.
