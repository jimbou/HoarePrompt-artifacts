Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the input data, printing pairs of indices of the same integer in the input array, with the pairs separated by spaces and each pair on a new line. The function handles cases where the number of pairs to be printed is less than k, and also handles cases where the number of pairs to be printed is equal to k. The function prints the pairs in the order they appear in the input array.**
