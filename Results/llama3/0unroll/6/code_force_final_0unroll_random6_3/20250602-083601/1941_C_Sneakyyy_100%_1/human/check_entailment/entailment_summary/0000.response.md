Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in each input string. This is done by iterating through the string three characters at a time, checking if the current substring is 'map' or 'pie', and if so, incrementing the count and moving the index three positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', the index is moved one position forward. This approach ensures that the program does not count overlapping occurrences, which is in line with the problem's requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
