Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates through the string, checking every substring of length 3. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the counter and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward. This ensures that the program counts the non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string.

The program also handles the edge case where the string is already beautiful, in which case it outputs 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
