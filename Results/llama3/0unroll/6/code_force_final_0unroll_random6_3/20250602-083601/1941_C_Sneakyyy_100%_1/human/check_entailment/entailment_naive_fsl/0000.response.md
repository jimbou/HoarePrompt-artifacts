Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains the substring "mapie" or "pimap". In these cases, the program will count the substrings "map" and "pie" separately, resulting in an incorrect count of the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two substrings "map" and "pie", resulting in an answer of 2, whereas the correct answer is 1, because only one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
