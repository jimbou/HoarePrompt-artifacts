#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of non-negative integers of length n, n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: the value of pergunta (which is an integer)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum value of `pergunta` after iterating through lists `a` and `b` from right to left, updating `pergunta` with the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` (the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`) and `a[i]` for indices `i` less than `m`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b` or the integers `n` and `m`, but only uses them to compute the returned value.
