Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of people in reverse order, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position. If the current position is within the desired range (i.e., less than `m`), it updates the minimum cost to reach that position. The program correctly handles the case where the minimum cost to reach a position is the minimum of the cost to bribe the person at that position (`a[i]`) and the cost to bribe all people between the current position and the desired position (`x`).

The program also correctly handles the edge case where `m` is 1, in which case the minimum cost is simply the cost to bribe the person at position `n-1`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
