Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the minimum value of `pergunta` after iterating through lists `a` and `b` from right to left, updating `pergunta` with the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` (the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`) and `a[i]` for indices `i` less than `m`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b` or the integers `n` and `m`, but only uses them to compute the returned value.**
