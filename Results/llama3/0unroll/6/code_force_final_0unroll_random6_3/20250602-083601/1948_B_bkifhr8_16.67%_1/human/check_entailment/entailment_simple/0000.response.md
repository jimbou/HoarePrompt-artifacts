Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a given integer array sorted in non-descending order by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then iterates over the array from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is less than the previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it applies the operation by deleting the previous element and inserting its digits in the same position.

After applying the operation, the program checks if the resulting array is sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The `func_1` function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It does this by comparing the input list with its sorted version.

Based on the provided execution states, the program seems to be correct. It correctly applies the operation to the array elements and checks if the resulting array is sorted. The `func_1` function is also correct in checking if a list is sorted.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the loop where it applies the operation, it modifies the list while iterating over it. This can lead to incorrect results if the operation causes the list to change size. To fix this, the program should iterate over the list in reverse order or use a different data structure that can handle insertion and deletion efficiently.

Despite this potential issue, the program seems to be correct based on the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
