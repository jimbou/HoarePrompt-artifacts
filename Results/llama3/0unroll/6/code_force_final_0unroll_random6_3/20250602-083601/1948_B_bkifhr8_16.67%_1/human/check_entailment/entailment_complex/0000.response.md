Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). 

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It then iterates over the array from the second element to the end. If it finds a pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them into the array. 

After modifying the array, it calls the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in ascending order. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks for pairs of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where the previous element is greater than the current element but the previous element is not greater than 10. In this case, the array cannot be sorted by splitting the previous element.

For example, if the input array is [2, 1], the program will print 'No' because it cannot split the element 2. However, the correct output should be 'No' because the array cannot be sorted by splitting any element.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
