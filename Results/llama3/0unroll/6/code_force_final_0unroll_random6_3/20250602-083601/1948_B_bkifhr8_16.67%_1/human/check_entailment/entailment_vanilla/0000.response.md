Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times. The program takes the number of test cases as input, and for each test case, it takes the length of the array and the array elements as input.

The program then iterates through the array from the second element to the last element. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them into the array.

After this process, the program checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with the sorted version of the array using the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the array is sorted after splitting the elements, but it does not consider the case where the array is already sorted before splitting the elements. Therefore, the program may incorrectly print 'No' for arrays that are already sorted.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will incorrectly print 'No' because it does not check if the array is already sorted before splitting the elements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
