Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `sorted_lst` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order.**

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers. However, a new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same non-negative integers as `lst`, but sorted in ascending order.
