Output State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, it has read two lines of input from stdin, processed the input, and printed the calculated cost to stdout. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `n`, `cost`, `w`, `mu` have been updated accordingly after each iteration. The state of `math` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
