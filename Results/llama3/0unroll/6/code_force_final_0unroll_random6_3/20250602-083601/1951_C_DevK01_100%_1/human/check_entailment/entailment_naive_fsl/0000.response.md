Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m). In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets.

For example, if n = 4, m = 2, k = 3, and the prices per ticket for each day are [8, 6, 4, 2], the program will incorrectly calculate the cost of buying the remaining ticket.

The correct approach would be to buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4, and then buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6, for a total cost of 10. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as 16.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
