Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end k.
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and sorts them in ascending order.
4. It calculates the minimum number of days q required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum purchase limit m.
5. It then calculates the total cost of buying k tickets over n days, considering the maximum purchase limit m and the prices per ticket for each day.
6. The cost is calculated by summing up the prices of the cheapest q days, where q is the minimum of m and k, and then adding the cost of buying the remaining tickets at the highest price.
7. Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought is less than or equal to the maximum purchase limit, and where the number of tickets to be bought is greater than the maximum purchase limit.

Correctness: **True**
