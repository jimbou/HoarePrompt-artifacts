Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n, m, k, and a_i are not affected by the code.
