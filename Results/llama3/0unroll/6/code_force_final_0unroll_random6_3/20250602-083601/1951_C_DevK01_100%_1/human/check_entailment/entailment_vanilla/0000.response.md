Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought as inputs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k). It then limits the value of m to be the minimum of m and k.
3.  The program sorts the prices per ticket for each day (M) in ascending order.
4.  It calculates the number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m). The value of q is calculated as the ceiling of k divided by m.
5.  The program then extracts the prices for the first q days (N) from the sorted prices (M).
6.  If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days (n \* m) is equal to k, it calculates the total cost as the sum of the prices for the first q days multiplied by m, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
7.  If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days is not equal to k, it calculates the cost for the remaining tickets (mu) and adds it to the total cost.
8.  Finally, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the constraints of the problem properly. It considers the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, the price increase due to purchasing tickets, and the minimum spending required to purchase k tickets.

Correctness: **True**
