Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering the maximum purchase limit m and the prices per ticket for each day. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program then sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum cost by considering the following cases:

1. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum purchase limit (m) is equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices by m and adding the sum of the products of m and the prices.

2. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum purchase limit (m) is not equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), it calculates the cost by multiplying the last price by the remaining tickets, adding the sum of the products of m and the remaining prices, and adding the sum of the products of m, the remaining days, and the remaining tickets.

The program prints the total cost for each test case.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly calculates the total cost of buying k tickets over n days, considering the maximum purchase limit m and the prices per ticket for each day, and prints the total cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
