Functionality: **The function modifies a list of integers by replacing a specified sublist with a repeated value. It takes a list of integers, two indices `r` and `l` representing the range of the sublist, and a list of operations `ops` as input. The function appends operations to `ops` and calls another function `func_2` with the same input. It then replaces the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` repeated `l - r + 1` times. The modified list is returned.**
