    return r, l
    #The program returns the end index 'r' and the start index 'l' of the subarray to be removed from 'lst' to obtain the maximum sum of subarray stored in 'over_sum'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function identifies the subarray within a given list of non-negative integers that, when removed, results in the maximum sum of the remaining subarray. It returns the start and end indices of this subarray.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that r >= l, and ops is a list that can be appended with lists of two integers.
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no return statement in the code snippet. The state of the variables remains the same: `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `r` equals `l`, and `ops` is a list that contains a new list of two integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` in addition to its previous elements.
    #State: *r and l are non-negative integers such that r > l, and ops is a list that can be appended with lists of two integers
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three parameters: two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can be appended with lists of two integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending new lists of two integers. If `r` equals `l`, it appends a single list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. If `r` is greater than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l` decremented by 1, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`, and then calls itself again with the same parameters. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list of lists of two integers.
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of two integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then the last two lists in `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list of integers where the sublist from index r to l (inclusive) is a list of l - r + 1 repeated l - r + 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list of integers by replacing a specified sublist with a repeated value. It takes a list of integers, two indices `r` and `l` representing the range of the sublist, and a list of operations `ops` as input. The function appends operations to `ops` and calls another function `func_2` with the same input. It then replaces the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` repeated `l - r + 1` times. The modified list is returned.
