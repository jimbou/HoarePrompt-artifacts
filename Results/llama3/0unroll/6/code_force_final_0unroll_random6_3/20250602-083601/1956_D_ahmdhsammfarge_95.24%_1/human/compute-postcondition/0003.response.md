Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of two integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then the last two lists in `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`.***
