Output State: **`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of two integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the end of the `ops` list, making it the last two lists. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is still 0.
