Output State: **r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of integers where the sublist from index r to l (inclusive) is a list of l - r + 1 repeated l - r + 1 times, ops is a list of lists of two integers where the last three lists are [r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1].**

The code modifies the list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` repeated `l - r + 1` times. The list `ops` is modified by appending three new lists: `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The variables `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
