Output State: **`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of two integers where the last list is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `ops` list, where a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` is appended to the end. This new list contains the incremented values of `r` and `l`. The rest of the preconditions remain valid, as the code does not modify the values of `r`, `l`, or `lst`.
