Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a. The problem description allows for the operation to be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the program does not ensure that this limit is not exceeded.

For example, if the input array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the program will perform the operation 2^18 times, which is greater than 5 * 10^5.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input array contains only zeros. In this case, the program should return a sum of 1 and a single operation [1, 1], but the program returns a sum of 0 and no operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
