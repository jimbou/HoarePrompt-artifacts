Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program uses three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` finds the maximum sum of subarray that can be obtained by removing a subarray from `lst` and returns the start and end indices of the subarray to be removed. `func_2` is a recursive function that appends lists of two integers to `ops` based on the values of `r` and `l`. `func_3` modifies `lst` and `ops` based on the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst`.

The main part of the program first calls `func_1` to find the maximum sum of subarray and the start and end indices of the subarray to be removed. It then enters a while loop that continues until `r` equals `l`. In each iteration, it calls `func_3` to modify `lst` and `ops` based on the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst`. After the while loop, it tries to find the index of 0 in `lst` and appends a list of two integers to `ops` if 0 is found. Finally, it prints the sum of `lst` and the length of `ops`, followed by the elements of `ops`.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program seems to be correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem and uses the functions to find the maximum sum of subarray and modify `lst` and `ops` accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
