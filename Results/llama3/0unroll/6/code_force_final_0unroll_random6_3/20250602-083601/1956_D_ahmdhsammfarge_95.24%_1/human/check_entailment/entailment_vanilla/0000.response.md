Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the indices of the subarray that would result in the maximum sum if the operation is applied. It does this by iterating over all possible subarrays and calculating the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray. If the calculated sum is greater than the current maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum and the corresponding indices.

`func_2` takes indices `r` and `l` and a list `ops` as input and recursively generates operations to transform the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` into a subarray of identical elements. It does this by first recursively generating operations for the subarray `lst[r:l]`, then appending an operation to set the entire subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the same value, and finally recursively generating operations for the subarray `lst[r:l]` again.

`func_3` takes indices `r` and `l`, a list `lst`, and a list `ops` as input and generates operations to transform the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` into a subarray of identical elements. It does this by first appending an operation to set the entire subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the same value, then checking if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends another operation to set the entire subarray to the same value. It then appends an operation to set the first element of the subarray to the length of the subarray, and finally calls `func_2` to generate operations to transform the rest of the subarray.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and generates a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum. The use of recursion in `func_2` and `func_3` ensures that the operations are generated correctly, and the checks in `func_3` ensure that the minimum value in the subarray is handled correctly.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In `func_1`, the calculation of the sum of the elements outside the subarray is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j-i+1)**2`, but the program uses `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j-i+1)**2` instead. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
