This function takes three parameters: two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can be appended with lists of two integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending new lists of two integers. If `r` equals `l`, it appends a single list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. If `r` is greater than `l`, it recursively calls itself with `l` decremented by 1, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`, and then calls itself again with the same parameters. The function does not return any value.
