Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is the number of elements in the array, l is 0, r is n - 1.**

The code first assigns the length of the array to the variable n. Since the array contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the length of the array is indeed n. The second line assigns 0 to the variable l and n - 1 to the variable r. The value of n is used to calculate r, which is now the index of the last element in the array. The variables array and find are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same.
