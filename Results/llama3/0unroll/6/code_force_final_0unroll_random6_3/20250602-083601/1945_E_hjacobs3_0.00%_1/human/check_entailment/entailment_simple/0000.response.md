Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the target element `x` in the permutation `p`. The program first finds the index `l` of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to `x` using binary search. If `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array, it means that `x` is not in its correct position in the sorted array. In this case, the program prints 1 and returns the indices of `l` and the index of `x` in the array, indicating that one swap operation is needed to move `x` to its correct position.

If `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array, it means that `x` is already in its correct position in the sorted array, and no swap operation is needed. In this case, the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the array, as the binary search algorithm will still find the index `l` of the first element that is greater than or equal to `x`, even if `x` is not present in the array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and correctly determines the number of swap operations needed to move `x` to its correct position in the sorted array.

Correctness: **True**
