This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target value 'find'. If 'find' is present in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the first element greater than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. If 'find' is not present in the array, it prints 0. The function does not modify the input array.
