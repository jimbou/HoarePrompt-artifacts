Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program does not guarantee this.

A counterexample is when the input is:

5
1
3 5 4 2 1

The program will output:

2
2 4
1 5

However, after swapping the elements at positions 2 and 4, and then at positions 1 and 5, the permutation becomes:

3 1 4 5 2

The binary search algorithm will then be executed, but it will not find the element 1 at position l. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.

The problem description also states that 2 operations are always sufficient, but the program does not guarantee this. In the counterexample above, the program performs 2 operations, but it still does not achieve the desired result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
