Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`.
3. It then reads the permutation `array` and calls the function `func_1` with `array` and `x` as arguments.
4. The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the permutation to find the index `l` such that `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
5. If `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the original permutation, it means that the permutation needs to be rearranged to make the binary search work correctly. In this case, the function prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`, which represent the swap operation needed to rearrange the permutation.
6. If `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the original permutation, it means that the permutation is already in a state that allows the binary search to work correctly. In this case, the function prints 0 and returns an empty list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of swap operations, but it prints the number of operations instead of returning it. This can be fixed by modifying the function to return the number of operations along with the list of swap operations.

Correctness: **False**
