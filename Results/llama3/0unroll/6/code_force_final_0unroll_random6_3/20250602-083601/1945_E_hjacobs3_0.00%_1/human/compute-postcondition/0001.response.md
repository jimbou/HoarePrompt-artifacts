Output State: **l is the index of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to find, r is the index of the last element in the array that is less than find, array remains unchanged, n remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `l` will point to the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to the target value `find`. The variable `r` will point to the last element in the array that is less than `find`. The array itself and the number of elements `n` remain unchanged.
