Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the index of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the second string is the index of 'find' in the array plus one.**

In this output state, the first string represents the index of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to 'find', which is stored in variable 'l'. Since 'l' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array, it means 'l' is the index of the next element that is greater than or equal to 'find'. The '+1' is added to 'l' to make it a 1-based index. The second string represents the index of 'find' in the array, which is obtained using the 'index' method of the array. The '+1' is added to this index to make it a 1-based index as well.
