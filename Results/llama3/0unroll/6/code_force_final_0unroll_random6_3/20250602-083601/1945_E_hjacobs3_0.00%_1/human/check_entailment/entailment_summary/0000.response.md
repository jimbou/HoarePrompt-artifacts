Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation array to find a target value 'x'. The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of swaps required to rearrange the array so that the binary search algorithm can find the target value 'x'.

However, the provided program does not actually implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Instead, it uses a modified binary search algorithm that finds the index of the first element greater than or equal to the target value 'find'. If the target value is not present in the array, it prints 0.

Moreover, the program does not perform any swaps on the input array. It only prints the indices of the elements that need to be swapped, but it does not actually modify the array.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
