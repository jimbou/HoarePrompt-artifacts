Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of binary digits (0s and 1s) representing free cells and cells containing chips, respectively. It then processes each test case by removing leading and trailing zeros, counts the number of zeros in the remaining list (i.e., the zeros in the middle), and prints this count for each test case.**
