The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

The remaining input in the standard input is still valid, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1).**
