Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of each cell `a`.
3. It then removes any leading or trailing zeros from the list `a`, as these do not affect the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
4. The program then iterates over the remaining cells in `a` and counts the number of zeros, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
5. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Cases where there are no chips (i.e., all cells are zero): In this case, the program correctly returns 0, as no operations are required.
* Cases where there is only one chip: In this case, the program correctly returns 0, as no operations are required.
* Cases where there are multiple chips separated by zeros: In this case, the program correctly counts the number of zeros between the chips and returns the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
* Cases where there are no zeros between the chips: In this case, the program correctly returns 0, as no operations are required.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
