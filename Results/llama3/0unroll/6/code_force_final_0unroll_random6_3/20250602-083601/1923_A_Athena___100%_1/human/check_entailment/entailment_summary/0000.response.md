Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of binary digits `a` representing the cells.
3.  It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the beginning and end of the list until it encounters a non-zero element. This is done to ignore the free cells at the beginning and end of the ribbon, as they do not affect the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.
4.  Then, it counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`, which represents the number of free cells between the chips. This count is stored in the variable `res`.
5.  Finally, it prints the count `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
