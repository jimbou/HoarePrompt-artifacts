Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.
3.  It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the beginning and end of the list until it encounters a non-zero element. This is done to exclude leading and trailing zeros from the count.
4.  Then, it iterates over the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros in the middle (i.e., excluding leading and trailing zeros). This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
5.  Finally, it prints the count of zeros in the middle for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the provided execution states match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
