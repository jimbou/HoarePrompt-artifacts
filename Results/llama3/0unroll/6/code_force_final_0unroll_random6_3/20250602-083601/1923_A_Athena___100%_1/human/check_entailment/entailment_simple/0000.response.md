Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.
3. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using two while loops. This is correct because the problem statement allows us to move chips to the closest free cell to the left, so leading and trailing zeros do not affect the minimum number of operations.
4. It then iterates over the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros in the middle (i.e., excluding leading and trailing zeros). This is correct because each zero in the middle represents a chip that needs to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which requires one operation.
5. Finally, it prints the count of zeros in the middle, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
