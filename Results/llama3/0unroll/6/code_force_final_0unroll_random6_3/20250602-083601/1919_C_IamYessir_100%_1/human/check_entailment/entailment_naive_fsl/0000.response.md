Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into two subsequences s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t. The program's logic for appending elements to a and b is incorrect and does not guarantee the optimal split.

For example, consider the input array [4, 3, 2, 1]. The program will split it into a = [4, 3, 2] and b = [1], resulting in a penalty of 2. However, the optimal split is a = [4, 1] and b = [3, 2], resulting in a penalty of 1.

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the last elements of a and b when deciding where to append the next element, without considering the overall structure of the subsequences. This leads to suboptimal splits and incorrect penalties.
