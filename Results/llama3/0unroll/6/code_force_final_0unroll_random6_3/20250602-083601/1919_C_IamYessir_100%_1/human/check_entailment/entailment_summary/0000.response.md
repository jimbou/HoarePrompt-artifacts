Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences 'a' and 'b' based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program then calculates the total penalty by counting the number of times an element in both lists 'a' and 'b' is greater than its previous element. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where one or both of the lists 'a' and 'b' are empty. The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has only one element.

Correctness: **True**
