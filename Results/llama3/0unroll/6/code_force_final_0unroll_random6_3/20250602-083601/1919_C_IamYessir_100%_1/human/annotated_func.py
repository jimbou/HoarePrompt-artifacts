#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())

    #State: The output state is the total number of times an element in the lists 'a' and 'b' is greater than its previous element, summed over all test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list of integers by distributing them into two lists, 'a' and 'b', based on certain conditions. The function counts the total number of times an element in both lists 'a' and 'b' is greater than its previous element and prints this count for each test case.
