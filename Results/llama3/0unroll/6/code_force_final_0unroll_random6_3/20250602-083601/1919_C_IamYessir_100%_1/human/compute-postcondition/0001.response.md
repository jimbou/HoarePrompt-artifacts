Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list of integers by distributing them into two lists, 'a' and 'b', based on certain conditions. The function counts the total number of times an element in both lists 'a' and 'b' is greater than its previous element and prints this count for each test case.**
