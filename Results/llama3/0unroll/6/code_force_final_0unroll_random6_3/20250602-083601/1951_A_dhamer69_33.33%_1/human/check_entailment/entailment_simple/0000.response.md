Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the base case where `n == 2`. In this case, the only possible configurations are '00', '01', '10', and '11'. The program correctly prints 'YES' for '00' and 'NO' for the other three configurations.
2.  For `n > 2`, the program checks if the number of '1's in the string is even. If it's not, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to pair up all the '1's.
3.  If the number of '1's is even, the program checks if there's a single '11' in the string. If there is, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to pair up the '1's without having two adjacent '1's.
4.  If the number of '1's is even and there's no single '11' in the string, the program correctly prints 'YES' because it's always possible to pair up the '1's without having two adjacent '1's.

Correctness: **True**
