Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input remaining: a binary string of size `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has only one input remaining, which is a binary string of size `t`.
