Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to whether a given binary string can be rearranged into a sequence of '11's and '00's.**

In natural language, the output state is a list of boolean values indicating whether each binary string in the input can be rearranged into a sequence of '11's and '00's. The loop iterates over each binary string, checks if it can be rearranged, and prints 'YES' if it can and 'NO' if it cannot. The output state is the collection of these 'YES' and 'NO' strings, one for each input binary string.
