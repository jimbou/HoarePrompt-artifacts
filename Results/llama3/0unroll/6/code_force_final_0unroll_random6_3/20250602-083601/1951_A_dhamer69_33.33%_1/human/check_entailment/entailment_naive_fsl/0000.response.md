Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input string `s` contains two consecutive '1's but they are not the only '1's in the string. For example, if `n = 4` and `s = '1011'`, the program will print 'NO' because `s.count('11') == 1`, but actually, it is possible to reach this configuration by turning on the first and third lamps, and then turning on the second and fourth lamps.
