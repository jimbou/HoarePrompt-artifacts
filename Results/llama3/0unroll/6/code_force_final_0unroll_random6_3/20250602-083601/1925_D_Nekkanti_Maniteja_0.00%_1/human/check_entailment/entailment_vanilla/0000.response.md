Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

3. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 (the total number of possible pairs) modulo M (10^9+7) and stores it in the variable c. This is done using the pow function with three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus.

4. It initializes two variables: s (to store the sum of friendship values) and a (to store the sum of initial friendship values).

5. It then reads the m pairs of friends and their friendship values, adding each friendship value to the variable a.

6. The program then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. This is done by iterating over the range of k (the number of excursions) and adding the product of c, i (the current excursion number), c, and m (the number of pairs of friends) to s. This represents the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends in the current excursion. It also adds the product of c and a (the sum of initial friendship values) to s. This represents the expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the sum.

7. Finally, the program prints the result modulo M.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, taking into account the modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.

Correctness: **True**
