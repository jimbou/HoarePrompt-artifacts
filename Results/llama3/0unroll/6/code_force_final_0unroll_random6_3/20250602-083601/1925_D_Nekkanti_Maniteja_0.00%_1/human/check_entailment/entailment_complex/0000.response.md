Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
2. It calculates the inverse of the number of possible edges in the graph (n*(n-1)//2) modulo M (10^9 + 7) using the pow function with a negative exponent. This is correct because the pow function with a negative exponent calculates the modular multiplicative inverse.
3. It initializes the sum of friendship values (s) to 0 and the sum of initial friendship values (a) to 0.
4. It reads the m lines of input for each test case, which contain the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. It adds the friendship value to the sum of initial friendship values (a).
5. It calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion using the formula: s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a, where c is the inverse of the number of possible edges, i is the current excursion, m is the number of pairs of friends, and a is the sum of initial friendship values. This formula is correct because it takes into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends (c * m) and the increase in friendship value for each excursion (c * i * c * m).
6. It prints the result of each test case, which is the sum of friendship values modulo M.

Overall, the program correctly implements the formula for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each test case, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
