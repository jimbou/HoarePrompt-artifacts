Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, followed by 3 integers n, m, and k, and then m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates a result for each test case using modular arithmetic with a large modulus (10^9 + 7), involving the inverse of the number of possible edges in a graph, the number of edges, and the sum of edge weights. The function then prints the result of each test case, one per line, as a series of integers representing the calculated sums modulo the large modulus.**
