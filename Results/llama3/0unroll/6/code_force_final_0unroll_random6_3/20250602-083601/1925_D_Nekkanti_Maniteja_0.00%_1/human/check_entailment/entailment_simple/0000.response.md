Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
2.  It calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo `M` (which is `10^9 + 7`), and stores it in `c`. This is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
3.  It initializes a variable `s` to store the expected sum of friendship values, and a variable `a` to store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
4.  It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values, and adds the friendship values to `a`.
5.  It calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion by adding the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends (`c * m`), the current excursion number `i`, and the modular inverse `c` to `s`. It also adds the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends (`c`) and the sum of the initial friendship values (`a`) to `s`.
6.  Finally, it prints the result modulo `M` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is the sum of the products of the probability of choosing a pair of friends, the current excursion number, and the modular inverse, plus the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the sum of the initial friendship values.

Correctness: **True**
