Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a test case. The calculation involves modular arithmetic with a large modulus (10^9 + 7), and the result is the sum of products of the inverse of the number of possible edges in a graph, the number of edges, and the sum of edge weights, all taken modulo the large modulus. The output state will have the same number of integers as the number of test cases in the input.**
