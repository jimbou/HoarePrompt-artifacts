Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers: k, x, and a. It then calculates a value 's' based on the given integers and prints 'Yes' if 'a' is greater than or equal to 's', and 'No' otherwise, for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly to the console.**
