Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario, where Sasha loses x times in a row, and then wins once. The program calculates the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to survive this worst-case scenario, and then checks if the initial amount of coins a is greater than or equal to this calculated amount.

The program uses a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum amount of coins needed. It starts with a bet of 1 coin, and then in each iteration, it increases the bet by the minimum amount needed to guarantee a win in the next iteration. This is done by adding the current bet divided by (k-1) plus 1 to the total amount of coins needed. This ensures that Sasha will have enough coins to win in the next iteration, even if he loses x times in a row.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins a is greater than or equal to the calculated amount, and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. This correctly implements the problem statement, and the program produces the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
