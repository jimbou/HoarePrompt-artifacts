The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9) â€” the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has.
