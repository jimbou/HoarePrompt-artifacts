Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem asks to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, which means removing the substrings "pie" and "map" while considering the overlap of "mapie".

The program uses the count() method to count the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string. It then prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie". This is correct because:

* Counting "map" and "pie" separately would double-count the overlapping "mapie" substrings.
* Subtracting the count of "mapie" ensures that each "mapie" substring is only counted once.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "pie" or "map") by printing 0.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
