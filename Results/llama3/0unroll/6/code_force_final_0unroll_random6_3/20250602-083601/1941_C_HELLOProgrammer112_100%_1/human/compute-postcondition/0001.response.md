Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings minus the count of 'mapie' substrings for each test case. It does not modify the input string or integer. The output consists of multiple lines, each containing the calculated count for a corresponding test case.**
