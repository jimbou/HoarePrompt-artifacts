Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Here's why:

*   The program correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s`.
*   It also correctly counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie" in the input string `s`. This is necessary because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and we need to avoid double-counting it.
*   The program then prints the total count of "map" and "pie" substrings minus the count of "mapie" substrings. This is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
