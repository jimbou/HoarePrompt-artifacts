Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program works by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string. The count of "mapie" is subtracted from the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" because "mapie" is a substring that contains both "map" and "pie", and deleting it would make the string beautiful.

The program then prints the result, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the substrings that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

Correctness: **True**
