Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` is a helper function that uses binary search to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. It first initializes several lists: `left` to store the cumulative sum of the slime sizes, `last` to store the index of the last slime with a different size, and `ans` to store the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.

The function then iterates over the slime sizes. If the current slime size is different from the previous one, it updates the `last` list. Otherwise, it keeps the same value as the previous one.

Next, it iterates over the slime sizes again. If the current slime size is less than the previous one, it sets the minimum number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten to 1. Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum of the slime sizes up to the current index minus the current slime size minus 1, and uses `func_1` to find the index of the first element in the `left` list that is greater than or equal to this value. It then updates the `ans` list with the minimum number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten.

Finally, the function returns the `ans` list.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses binary search to efficiently find the index of the first element in the `left` list that is greater than or equal to the calculated value, which reduces the time complexity of the program. The program also correctly handles the case where the current slime size is less than the previous one, and the case where the calculated value is less than 0.

Correctness: **True**
