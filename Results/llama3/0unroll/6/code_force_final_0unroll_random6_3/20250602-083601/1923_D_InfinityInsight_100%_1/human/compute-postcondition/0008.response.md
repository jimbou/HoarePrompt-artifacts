Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers and its length as input, and returns a list of the same length where each element at index i is either -1 or the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. The function analyzes the input list to identify the longest increasing subsequences and their lengths, and stores this information in the output list. If no increasing subsequence ends at a particular index, the corresponding output element is -1.**
