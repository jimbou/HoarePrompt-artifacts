You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of list a.
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: The list last contains the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in the list a, in the order they appear in a. The list ans remains unchanged, still containing n elements all equal to -1. The list left remains unchanged, still containing a single element 0.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: The list left contains the prefix sums of the elements in the list a, in the order they appear in a. The list last remains unchanged, still containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in the list a, in the order they appear in a. The list ans remains unchanged, still containing n elements all equal to -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: Output State: The list left contains the prefix sums of the elements in the list a, in the order they appear in a. The list last remains unchanged, still containing the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in the list a, in the order they appear in a. The list ans contains n elements, where each element at index i is either -1 or a value representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of n elements, where each element at index i is either -1 or a value representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of n elements, where each element at index i is either -1 or a value representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
