You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals.
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals, den is an integer and equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the last element of vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains the same: vals is a list of integers with each integer greater or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the length of vals, vprod is a list of integers, and den is an integer less than or equal to 0. Additionally, -1 has been printed.
    #State: *vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals, vprod is a list of integers, den is an integer and equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the last element of vals minus the sum of vprod, and den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod elements] (where vprod elements are the elements of the vprod list)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains the same: vals is a list of integers with each integer greater or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the length of vals, vprod is a list of integers, and den is an integer less than or equal to 0. Additionally, -1 has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
