Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that we come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program provided uses the concept of least common multiple (LCM) to find the distribution.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using the `func_1` function. This is correct because the LCM of the multipliers represents the smallest amount that can be distributed among all outcomes such that each outcome receives a multiple of its corresponding multiplier.

2. The program then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, which represents the amount that would be received back for each outcome if it were to win. This is correct because the product of the LCM and a multiplier is indeed the amount that would be received back for that outcome.

3. The program then subtracts the sum of these products from the LCM to find the remaining amount that can be distributed among the outcomes. This is correct because the remaining amount represents the difference between the total amount that would be received back and the total amount that was distributed.

4. If the remaining amount is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. This is correct because if the remaining amount is less than or equal to 0, it means that the total amount that would be received back is less than or equal to the total amount that was distributed, which violates the problem's condition.

5. Otherwise, the program prints the products of the LCM and each multiplier, which represents the distribution of coins among the outcomes. This is correct because this distribution ensures that the total amount that would be received back for each outcome is strictly greater than the total amount that was distributed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
