Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving a list of integers. It first computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the input integers, then calculates the difference between the LCM and the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each input integer. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without modifying the input list. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients. The function does not return any value and modifies the input list only if the result is greater than 0.**
