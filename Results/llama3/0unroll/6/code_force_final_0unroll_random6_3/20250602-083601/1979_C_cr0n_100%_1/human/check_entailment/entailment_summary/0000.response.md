Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, which is used in `func_2` to compute the LCM of all the input integers.

Function `func_2` takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input. It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers and then computes the difference between the LCM and the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each multiplier. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets on each outcome. The condition to check if the result is less than or equal to 0 is also correct, as it indicates that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
