Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to find the minimum amount of coins that need to be distributed.

The program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (k_i) using the `func_1` function. This LCM is stored in the variable `den`. Then, it calculates the product of `den` and the reciprocal of each multiplier, which is stored in the list `vprod`. The sum of these products is subtracted from `den` to get the remaining amount of coins.

If the remaining amount of coins is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the elements of the `vprod` list, which represent the amount of coins to be distributed for each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to find the minimum amount of coins that need to be distributed. It also correctly checks if the remaining amount of coins is less than or equal to 0 and prints -1 in that case.

Correctness: **True**
