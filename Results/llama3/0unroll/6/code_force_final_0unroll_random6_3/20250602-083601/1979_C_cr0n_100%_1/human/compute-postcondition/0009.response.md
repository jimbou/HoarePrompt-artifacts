The code prints a string containing the elements of the `vprod` list, separated by spaces. The `vprod` list is a list of integers, but the exact values are not provided in the precondition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `vprod` list.

Output: **[vprod elements] (where vprod elements are the elements of the vprod list)**
