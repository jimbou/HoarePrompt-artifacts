Output State: **vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals, den is an integer and equal to the first element of vals**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `N`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `vals`. The third line assigns the first element of `vals` to `den`. Since each integer in `vals` is greater or equal than 2, `den` is also greater or equal than 2. The value of `N` is equal to the length of `vals`, which is a positive integer.
