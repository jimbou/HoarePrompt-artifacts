Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

`func_2` is the main function that takes the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals` as input. It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_1` and stores it in `den`. Then, it calculates the product of each multiplier with the LCM and stores it in `vprod`. The program then checks if the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the products.

The program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and checks if the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products is less than or equal to 0. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, in which case the LCM is simply the multiplier itself, and the program correctly prints -1.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
