#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, a and b, without modifying the input values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals.
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals, den is an integer and equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the last element of vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains the same: vals is a list of integers with each integer greater or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the length of vals, vprod is a list of integers, and den is an integer less than or equal to 0. Additionally, -1 has been printed.
    #State: *vals is a list of integers, each integer is greater or equal than 2, N is a positive integer and equal to the length of vals, vprod is a list of integers, den is an integer and equal to the result of func_1 applied to the first element of vals and the last element of vals minus the sum of vprod, and den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod elements] (where vprod elements are the elements of the vprod list)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving a list of integers. It first computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the input integers, then calculates the difference between the LCM and the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each input integer. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without modifying the input list. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients. The function does not return any value and modifies the input list only if the result is greater than 0.
