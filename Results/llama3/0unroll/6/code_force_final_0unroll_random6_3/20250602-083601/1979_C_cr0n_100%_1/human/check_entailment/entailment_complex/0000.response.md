Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` uses this LCM to determine the distribution of coins.

In `func_2`, the program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in the input list `vals`. It then calculates the difference between this LCM and the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each multiplier. If this difference is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients, which represents the distribution of coins.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the distribution of coins. The condition for printing -1 is also correct, as a negative or zero difference would indicate that it's not possible to distribute the coins in a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
