This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make each test case array a palindrome. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). The function returns t lines, each containing a single integer representing the minimum number of operations required to make the corresponding test case array a palindrome.
