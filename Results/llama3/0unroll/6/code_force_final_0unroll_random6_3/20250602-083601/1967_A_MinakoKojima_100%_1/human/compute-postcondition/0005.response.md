Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then processes each test case by sorting the integers, calculating a result based on the sorted integers and the value of k, and appending this result to a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list to the console. The function effectively solves a problem involving integer sorting and calculation, and outputs the results for multiple test cases.**
