Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 100). Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).**

In natural language, the output state is that we have an empty list called `ans_list` and the input remains the same as in the initial state, waiting to be processed.
