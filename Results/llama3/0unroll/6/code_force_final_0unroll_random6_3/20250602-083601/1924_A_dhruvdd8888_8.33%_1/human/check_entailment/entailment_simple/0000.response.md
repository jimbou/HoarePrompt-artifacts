Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly implements the logic to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. It uses a sliding window approach to find all substrings of s that contain all the characters in the set us, which represents the first k lowercase English alphabets.

The program correctly handles the case where all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s by printing 'YES' and returning None. It also correctly handles the case where not all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s by printing 'NO' and then printing a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program's logic and implementation are correct, and it produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
