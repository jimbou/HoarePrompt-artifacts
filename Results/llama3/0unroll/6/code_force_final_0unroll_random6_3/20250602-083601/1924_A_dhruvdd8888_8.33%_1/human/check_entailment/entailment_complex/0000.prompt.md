Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s contains only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None
    #State: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ps is less than n.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop prints a string for each character in the set us that is not in the set win. The string printed for each character consists of the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, followed by the character itself, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. The values of n, k, m, s, us, win, ans, ps, and stdin remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns None. The function reads two lines of input for each test case: the first line contains three integers (n, k, m) and the second line contains a string (s) of length m. It then checks if the string contains at least n substrings of length k that include all the first k lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates additional output by appending characters to the substrings found. The function processes multiple test cases from stdin.
