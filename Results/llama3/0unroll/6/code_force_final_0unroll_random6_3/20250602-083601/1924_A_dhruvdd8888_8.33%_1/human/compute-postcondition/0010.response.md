Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns None. The function reads two lines of input for each test case: the first line contains three integers (n, k, m) and the second line contains a string (s) of length m. It then checks if the string contains at least n substrings of length k that include all the first k lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates additional output by appending characters to the substrings found. The function processes multiple test cases from stdin.**
