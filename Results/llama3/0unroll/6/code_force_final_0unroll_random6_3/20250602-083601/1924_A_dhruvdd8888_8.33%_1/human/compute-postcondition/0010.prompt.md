You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s contains only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None
    #State: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ps is less than n.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop prints a string for each character in the set us that is not in the set win. The string printed for each character consists of the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, followed by the character itself, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. The values of n, k, m, s, us, win, ans, ps, and stdin remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'YES' and returns None

Case_2: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop prints a string for each character in the set us that is not in the set win. The string printed for each character consists of the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, followed by the character itself, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. The values of n, k, m, s, us, win, ans, ps, and stdin remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
