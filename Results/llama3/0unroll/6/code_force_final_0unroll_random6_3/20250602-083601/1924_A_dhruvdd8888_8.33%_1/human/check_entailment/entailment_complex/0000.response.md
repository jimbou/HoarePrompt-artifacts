Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. If such strings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates additional output by appending characters to the substrings found.

The program uses a sliding window approach to find all substrings of length k that include all the first k lowercase English alphabets. It maintains a set `us` of the first k lowercase English alphabets and a set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window. It also maintains a list `ans` to store the last character of each substring that contains all the characters in `us`.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of substrings found is less than n, in which case it prints 'NO' and generates additional output.

Correctness: **True**
