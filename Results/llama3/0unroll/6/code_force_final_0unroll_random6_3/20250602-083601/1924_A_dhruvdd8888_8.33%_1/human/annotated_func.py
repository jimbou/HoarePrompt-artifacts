#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s contains only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None
    #State: n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a string of length m containing only the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and ps is less than n.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop prints a string for each character in the set us that is not in the set win. The string printed for each character consists of the last character of each substring of s that contains all the characters in us, followed by the character itself, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. The values of n, k, m, s, us, win, ans, ps, and stdin remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns None. The function reads two lines of input for each test case: the first line contains three integers (n, k, m) and the second line contains a string (s) of length m. It then checks if the string contains at least n substrings of length k that include all the first k lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates additional output by appending characters to the substrings found. The function processes multiple test cases from stdin.
