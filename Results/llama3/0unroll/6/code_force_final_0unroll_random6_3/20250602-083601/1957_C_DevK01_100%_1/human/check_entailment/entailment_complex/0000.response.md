Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The key insight is that the number of final configurations is equal to the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is the number of remaining valid moves. This is because each valid move can be either a white rook or a black rook, and the computer's response is determined by the player's move.

The program correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 using dynamic programming. It maintains a list of the last two Fibonacci numbers, updating it iteratively until it reaches the nth number, and finally returns the nth Fibonacci number.

The program also correctly handles the case where the player's move is mirrored by the computer, and the case where the player's move is not mirrored by the computer.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
