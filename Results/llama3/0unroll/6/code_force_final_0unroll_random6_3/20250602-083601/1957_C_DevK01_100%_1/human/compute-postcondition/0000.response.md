Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `dp` and assigned it a list containing two elements, both equal to 1.
