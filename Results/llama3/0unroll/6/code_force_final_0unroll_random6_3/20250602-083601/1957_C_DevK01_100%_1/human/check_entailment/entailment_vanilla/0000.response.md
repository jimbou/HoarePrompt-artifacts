Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the program continues the game until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program first reads the number of test cases, t. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, n, and the number of moves already played, k. It then reads the k moves, which are the positions (r, c) where the white rooks are placed.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting the number of moves already played from the total number of moves possible on the chessboard. If a move is a mirror move (i.e., r = c), it subtracts 1 from the total number of moves; otherwise, it subtracts 2.

The program then calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of different final configurations possible with the remaining valid moves. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

The function initializes a list dp with the first two values as 1. It then iterates from 2 to n, calculating the number of configurations for each i. The calculation is based on the fact that for each i, the number of configurations is the sum of the number of configurations for i-1 and 2 times the number of configurations for i-2, multiplied by the number of ways to place the rooks in the current position.

Finally, the program prints the result of the function func_1, which is the number of different final configurations possible.

Correctness: **True**
