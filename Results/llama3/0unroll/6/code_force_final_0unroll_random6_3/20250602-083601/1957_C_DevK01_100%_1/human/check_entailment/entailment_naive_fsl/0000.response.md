Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program first calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting the number of moves already made (k) from the total number of moves possible on the board (n). If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., a = b), it reduces the number of valid moves by 2; otherwise, it reduces the number of valid moves by 1.

The function func_1(n) calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the base cases [1, 1] and then iteratively calculates the number of configurations for each remaining valid move. The formula used to calculate the number of configurations is based on the fact that for each remaining valid move, there are two possibilities: either the move is mirrored by the computer, or it is not. If the move is mirrored, the number of configurations is the same as the number of configurations for the previous move; if the move is not mirrored, the number of configurations is twice the number of configurations for the previous move.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of moves already made (k) is 0, in which case the number of valid moves is equal to the total number of moves possible on the board (n). It also correctly handles the case where the number of moves already made (k) is equal to the total number of moves possible on the board (n), in which case there are no valid moves remaining.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
