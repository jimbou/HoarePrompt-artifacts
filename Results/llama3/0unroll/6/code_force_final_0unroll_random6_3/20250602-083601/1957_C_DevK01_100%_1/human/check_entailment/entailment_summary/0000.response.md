Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, taking into account the mirroring of moves by the computer and the constraints of the chessboard.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of each move and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly, taking into account the mirroring of moves by the computer.

After that, it calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which represents the number of different final configurations possible.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number by maintaining a list of the last two Fibonacci numbers and updating it iteratively until it reaches the nth number.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
