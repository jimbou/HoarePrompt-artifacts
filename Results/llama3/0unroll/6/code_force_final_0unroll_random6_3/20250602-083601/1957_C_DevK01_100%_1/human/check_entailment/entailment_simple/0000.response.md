Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The game is played on an n x n chessboard, where the player and the computer take turns placing white and black rooks, respectively. The player starts first, and the computer mirrors the player's moves. If the player places a rook on a position (r, c), the computer places a black rook at position (c, r) in its turn. If r = c, then the computer skips its turn.

The given program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible after k moves. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, t.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, n, and the number of moves already played, k.
3. It then reads the k moves made by the player and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., r = c), it decrements the size of the chessboard by 1. Otherwise, it decrements the size of the chessboard by 2.
4. After updating the size of the chessboard, it calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of different final configurations possible.
5. The function func_1 calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 1) and then iteratively calculates the next Fibonacci numbers using the recurrence relation dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \* (i-1) \* dp[i-2] modulo 10^9 + 7.
6. Finally, the program prints the result of the function call, which is the number of different final configurations possible after k moves.

The program is correct because it correctly updates the size of the chessboard based on the moves made by the player and the computer, and it correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible using the Fibonacci sequence.

Correctness: **True**
