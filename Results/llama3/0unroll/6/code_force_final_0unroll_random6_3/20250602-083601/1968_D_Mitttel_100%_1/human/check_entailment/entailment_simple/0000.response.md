Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns. It does this by simulating the game and keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved at each step.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for both players, and then compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for `k` turns, and it correctly calculates the score for each player. The use of the `vis` array to keep track of visited positions ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop if the permutation contains cycles.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
