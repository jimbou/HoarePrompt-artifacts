Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by a player starting from a given position. The function iterates through the permutation, accumulating the scores and keeping track of the maximum score that can be obtained with the remaining steps. The program then compares the scores of both players and determines the winner based on the comparison.

The program correctly handles the case where the players have the same score, in which case it outputs "Draw". It also correctly handles the case where one player's score is higher than the other's, in which case it outputs the name of the player with the higher score.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
