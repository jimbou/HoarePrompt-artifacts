Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in the permutation and move simultaneously for a certain number of turns. The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.

The program uses a function, func_1, to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by a player starting from a given position. This function iterates through the permutation, accumulating the values from the array at each step, and keeps track of the maximum score that can be obtained with the remaining steps.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls the func_1 function for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions, and compares their scores to determine the winner.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the game logic, calculates the scores for both players, and determines the winner based on their scores.

Correctness: **True**
