Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p) for all i, s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.**

In this final state, the variables a, p, s, and k retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code. The new variables n, mx, cur, and vis are introduced and initialized according to the code. The length of p is assigned to n, mx and cur are set to 0, and vis is created as a list of n zeros.
