Output State: **vis[s] is 1, k is 0, mx is the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s] for all iterations, cur is the sum of a[s] for all iterations, and s is the last value of p[s] in the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* The visited array `vis` will have a value of 1 at the index `s`, indicating that the node `s` has been visited.
* The value of `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has executed `k` iterations.
* The value of `mx` will be the maximum value of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for all iterations, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path from the starting node `s` to the current node `s` with the remaining `k` steps.
* The value of `cur` will be the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, which represents the total value obtained by traversing the path from the starting node `s` to the current node `s`.
* The value of `s` will be the last value of `p[s]` in the loop, which represents the current node in the path.

Note that the values of `a`, `p`, `n`, and `vis` (except for the value at index `s`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
