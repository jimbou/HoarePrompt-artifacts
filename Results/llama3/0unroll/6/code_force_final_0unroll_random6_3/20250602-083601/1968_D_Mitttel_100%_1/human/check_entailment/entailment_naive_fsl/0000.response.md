Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the game lasts for more than the length of the cycle in the permutation. In this case, the program should calculate the score for the remaining turns after the cycle is completed, but it does not do so.

For example, consider the input:

n = 4, k = 5, pb = 3, ps = 2
p = [4, 1, 2, 3]
a = [7, 2, 5, 6]

In this case, the cycle for Bodya is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3, and the cycle for Sasha is 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2. The program correctly calculates the score for the first 4 turns, but it does not calculate the score for the remaining turn.

To fix this, the program should calculate the score for the remaining turns after the cycle is completed, by adding the score for the remaining turns to the maximum score calculated so far.

Here is the corrected code:

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    if k > 0:
        cycle_len = sum(vis)
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_len
        for i in range(remaining_turns):
            mx = max(mx, cur + remaining_turns * a[s])
            cur += a[s]
            s = p[s]
    return mx
