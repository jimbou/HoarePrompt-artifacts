Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the two input numbers have different lengths. In this case, the program will throw an error when trying to access the elements of the shorter list. 

For example, if the input is:

3
123
45

The program will throw an error when trying to access the third element of the list "45", which does not exist.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the two input numbers have the same length before proceeding with the swapping operation.
