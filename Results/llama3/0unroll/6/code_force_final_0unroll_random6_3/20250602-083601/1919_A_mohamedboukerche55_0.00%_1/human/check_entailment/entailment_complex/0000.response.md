Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. For each pair, it checks if the sum of the pair is even or odd and prints 'bob' or 'alice' accordingly.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the game is symmetric, and the players will always end up with the same parity of coins in their wallets.

The program correctly implements this parity check and prints the winner accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
