Reasoning: 

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of either exchanging wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, followed by removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The provided program determines the winner of the game by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob', indicating that Bob wins. If the sum is odd, it prints 'alice', indicating that Alice wins.

The reasoning behind this approach is based on the observation that the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner of the game. When the sum is even, Bob can always make a valid move by either exchanging wallets or keeping his current wallet and removing a coin. On the other hand, when the sum is odd, Alice can always make a valid move by either exchanging wallets or keeping her current wallet and removing a coin.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads pairs of integers from standard input and prints 'bob' if the sum is even and 'alice' if the sum is odd.

Correctness: **True**
