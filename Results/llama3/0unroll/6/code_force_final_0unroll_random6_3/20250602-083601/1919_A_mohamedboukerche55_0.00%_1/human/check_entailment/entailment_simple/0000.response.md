Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. A valid move consists of two steps: exchanging wallets with the opponent (optional) and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, i.e., when their wallet is empty.

The provided program uses a simple parity check to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

The reasoning behind this approach is that the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game is symmetric, and the players alternate turns. When the sum of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will make the last valid move. Conversely, when the sum of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to make the last valid move.

Therefore, the provided program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
