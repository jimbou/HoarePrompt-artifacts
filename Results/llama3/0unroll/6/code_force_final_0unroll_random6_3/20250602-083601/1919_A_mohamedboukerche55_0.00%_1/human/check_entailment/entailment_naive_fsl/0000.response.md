Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the fact that if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who removes the last coin wins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be able to make a move, and if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always be able to make a move.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets and printing "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
