Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by reading the number of test cases and the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets and checks if it is even or odd.

The program's logic is based on the observation that if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the players alternate turns, and the total number of coins decreases by 1 in each turn. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have a valid move, whereas if it is odd, Alice will always have a valid move.

However, there is a small issue with the program's output. The program prints 'bob' instead of 'Bob' and 'alice' instead of 'Alice'. This is a minor mistake, but it does not affect the correctness of the program's logic.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of its logic, but it has a small error in its output formatting.

Correctness: **True**
