Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. 

The program first checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. 

If no such pair is found, it means that each friend's best friend is not their own best friend. In this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party. This is because if Monocarp sends invitations to only 2 friends, it's possible that neither of them will attend if their best friend doesn't receive an invitation. 

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send.
