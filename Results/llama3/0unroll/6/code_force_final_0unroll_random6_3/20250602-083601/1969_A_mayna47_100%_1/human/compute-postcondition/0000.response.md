Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n from the second line of the test case, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, which was read from the first line of the test case. The list `v` has been initialized with `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` from the second line of the test case. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
