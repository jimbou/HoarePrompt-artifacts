The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n, x_i != 0). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three lines as described above.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the third line contains `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`.**
