Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case, indicating whether the player can survive the monsters or not. The value of `t` will be unchanged, and the input from stdin will be consumed. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` will be reinitialized for each test case and will not retain any value after the loop finishes.**
