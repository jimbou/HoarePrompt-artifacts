Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, which is correct because removing any number of elements from an array with all equal elements will still result in a beautiful array.

2. If the array contains at least one pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, the program then finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. The minimum count is updated whenever a different element is encountered.

3. Finally, the program prints the minimum number of consecutive equal elements, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
