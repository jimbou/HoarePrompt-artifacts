The code prints the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array `arr`. Since `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array `arr`, and the array `arr` does not contain all equal elements, the value of `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive equal elements in the array `arr`.
Output: **the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array arr**
