Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal, and if so, it prints -1. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements and prints this value. The program does not modify the input array.

Correctness: **True**
