Output State: **flag remains True if the array arr contains all equal elements, otherwise flag is False. The value of n and the array arr remain unchanged. ans is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array arr, val is the first element of the array arr, and cnt is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last index of the array arr.**

In natural language, the code updates the value of ans to be the minimum of its current value and cnt. The other variables remain unchanged. The flag still indicates whether all elements in the array arr are equal, and the values of n, arr, val, and cnt are not affected by the code.
