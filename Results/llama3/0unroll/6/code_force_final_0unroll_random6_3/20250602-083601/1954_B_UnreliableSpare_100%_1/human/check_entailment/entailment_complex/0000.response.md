Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal by iterating through the array and checking if each element is equal to the previous one. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, it sets the flag to False.

2. If the flag is still True after the loop, it means all elements in the array are equal, and the program prints -1 as required by the problem statement.

3. If the flag is False, the program then finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array. It does this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count if necessary.

4. Finally, the program prints the minimum count of consecutive equal elements, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are equal, and it correctly finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array.

Correctness: **True**
