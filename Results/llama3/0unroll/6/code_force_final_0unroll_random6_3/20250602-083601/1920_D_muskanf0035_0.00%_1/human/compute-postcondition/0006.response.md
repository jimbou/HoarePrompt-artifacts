Functionality: This function takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It processes the operations, which can either append a value to an array or duplicate the existing array. After processing all operations, it uses the resulting array to answer queries by returning the value at the index calculated as `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`. The function returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of a query.
