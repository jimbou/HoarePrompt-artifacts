Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the two types of operations and queries. However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the second type of operation. 

In the second type of operation, Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a. However, in the given program, this operation is implemented as `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, which is equivalent to appending a single copy of array a to the end of array a, not x copies.

To fix this error, the implementation of the second type of operation should be modified to append x copies of array a to the end of array a. This can be achieved by using a loop to extend the array x times.

Correctness: **False**
