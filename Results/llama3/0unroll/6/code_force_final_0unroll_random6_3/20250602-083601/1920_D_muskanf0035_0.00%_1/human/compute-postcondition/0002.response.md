Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `result` variable will hold the output of the `func_1` function for each iteration, and this output will be printed to the console. The values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` will be updated for each iteration based on the input provided. The value of `t` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
