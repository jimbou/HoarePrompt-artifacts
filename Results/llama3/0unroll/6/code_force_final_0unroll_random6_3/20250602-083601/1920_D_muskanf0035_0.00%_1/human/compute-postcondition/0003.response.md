Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` lists of two integers `operations`, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It performs a series of operations based on the input and returns a result. The purpose of the function is to process the input data and produce an output that is printed to the console. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the output of the function is stored in the `result` variable and printed to the console, while the input variables `n`, `operations`, and `queries` are updated for each iteration of the loop.**
