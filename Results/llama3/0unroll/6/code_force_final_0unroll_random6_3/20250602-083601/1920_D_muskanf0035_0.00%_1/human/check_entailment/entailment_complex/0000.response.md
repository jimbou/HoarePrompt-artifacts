Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty. There are `n` operations of two types that he must perform in the given order. The first type of operation appends an integer `x` to the end of array `a`, and the second type of operation appends `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`. After performing all `n` operations, Jayden has `q` queries, and for each query, he wants to know the `k`-th element of array `a`.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It processes the operations by either appending a value to an array or duplicating the array. Then, it uses the queries to extract values from the processed array, where each query corresponds to an index in the array. The function returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value at the index specified by the corresponding query, wrapping around to the start of the array if the index exceeds its length.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of operations `n`, the number of queries `q`, the operations, and the queries. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly processes the operations and queries, and the `func_2` function correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` with the correct parameters.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_1`. In the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, the array is extended by its own length, which can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the array. This can cause the program to run out of memory or take a very long time to execute for large inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False** due to the logical error in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
