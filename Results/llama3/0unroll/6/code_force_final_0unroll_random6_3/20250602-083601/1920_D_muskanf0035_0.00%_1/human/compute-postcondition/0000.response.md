Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, `queries` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that was input by the user, while the values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains no input, as it was used to input the value of `t`.
