Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. The operations can be of two types: appending an integer `x` to the end of the array, or appending `x` copies of the array to the end of the array. After performing these operations, Jayden has a list of queries, where each query corresponds to an index in the array, and he wants to know the value at that index.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries as input. It processes the operations by either appending a value to an array or duplicating the array. Then, it uses the queries to extract values from the processed array, where each query corresponds to an index in the array. The function returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value at the index specified by the corresponding query, wrapping around to the start of the array if the index exceeds its length.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user. It reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of operations, a list of `n` lists of two integers `operations`, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program is correct. The functions seem to be implementing the required operations and queries correctly, and the main function is reading the input and calling the functions as expected.

Correctness: **True**
