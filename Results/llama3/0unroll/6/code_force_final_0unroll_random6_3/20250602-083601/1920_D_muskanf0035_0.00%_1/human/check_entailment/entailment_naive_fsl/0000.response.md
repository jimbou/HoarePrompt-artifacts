Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is larger than the current size of the array. In the problem description, it is mentioned that Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a, which means the size of the array can increase exponentially. However, the program does not take this into account and always uses the current size of the array to calculate the result.

For example, if the operations are [(1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)], the array will be [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] after the third operation. If the query is 10, the program will return 2, which is incorrect. The correct result should be 1, because the 10th element is the 2nd element of the 5th copy of the original array [1, 2].

To fix this issue, the program needs to keep track of the size of the array after each operation and use this size to calculate the result for each query.
