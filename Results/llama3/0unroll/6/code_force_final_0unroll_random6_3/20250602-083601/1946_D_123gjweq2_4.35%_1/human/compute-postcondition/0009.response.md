thing1 is assigned the value of find_max(new_arr, bit - 1). The value of find_max(new_arr, bit - 1) is unknown, so the output state is: thing1 is assigned the value of find_max(new_arr, bit - 1). The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **thing1 is assigned the value of find_max(new_arr, bit - 1), new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is 0, and the bit-th bit of xor is 0**
