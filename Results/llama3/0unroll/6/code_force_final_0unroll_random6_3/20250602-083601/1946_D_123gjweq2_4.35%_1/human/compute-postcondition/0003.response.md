Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0, and thing1 is 0.**

The code initializes three new variables: `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1`. The `new_arr` is set to an empty list, `xor` is set to 0, and `thing1` is also set to 0. The initial state of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged as the code does not modify these variables.
