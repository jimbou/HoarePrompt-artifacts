You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30.
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list cur_arr.
    #State: *cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30. bit is not equal to -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: Output State: new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is 0, and thing1 is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: *new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is 0. If the current value of the bit in the binary representation of xor is 1, thing1 is -1. Otherwise, thing1 is assigned the value of find_max(new_arr, bit - 1).
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the list `new_arr` (excluding the current bit) and the length of the list `new_arr`.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns the maximum value in the list new_arr, considering only the bits up to bit - 1 in the binary representation of the numbers.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list cur_arr.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the list `new_arr` (excluding the current bit) and the length of the list `new_arr`.

Case_3: The program returns the maximum value in the list new_arr, considering only the bits up to bit - 1 in the binary representation of the numbers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
