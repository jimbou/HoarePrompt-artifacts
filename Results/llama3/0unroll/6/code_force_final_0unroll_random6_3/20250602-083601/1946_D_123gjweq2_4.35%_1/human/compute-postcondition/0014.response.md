Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the list new_arr, considering only the bits up to bit - 1 in the binary representation of the numbers.**

In this output state, the program returns the value of `thing1`, which is assigned the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. This function likely finds the maximum value in the list `new_arr` by considering only the bits up to `bit - 1` in the binary representation of the numbers. Since `xor` is 0 and the current value of the bit in its binary representation is 0, this information does not affect the return value. The returned value is solely based on the maximum value found in `new_arr` using the specified bit consideration.
