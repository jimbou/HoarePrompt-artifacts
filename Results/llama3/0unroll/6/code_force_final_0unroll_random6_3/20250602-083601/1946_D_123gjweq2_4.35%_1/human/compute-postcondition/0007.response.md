Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is -1, and the current value of the bit in the binary representation of `xor` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been updated to -1, while the values of `new_arr` and `xor` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the binary representation of `xor` is still valid, indicating that the current bit in its binary representation is 1.
