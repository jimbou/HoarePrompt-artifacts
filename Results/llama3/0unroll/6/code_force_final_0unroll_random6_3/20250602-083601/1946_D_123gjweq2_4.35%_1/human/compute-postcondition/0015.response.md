Functionality: **This function determines the maximum value based on the binary representation of numbers in a list. It takes a list of non-negative integers, a bit position, and a non-negative integer as input. If the bit position is -1, it returns the number of non-negative integers in the list. Otherwise, it processes the list by XORing the numbers and splitting them based on the bit value at the given position. It then returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the processed list (excluding the current bit) and the length of the processed list, or the maximum value in the processed list considering only the bits up to the previous bit position, depending on the bit value of the input integer at the given position.**
