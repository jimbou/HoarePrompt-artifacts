Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the list `new_arr` (excluding the current bit) and the length of the list `new_arr`.**

In this output state, `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` is the maximum value in the list `new_arr` excluding the current bit, and `len(new_arr)` is the length of the list `new_arr`. The program returns the maximum value between these two.
