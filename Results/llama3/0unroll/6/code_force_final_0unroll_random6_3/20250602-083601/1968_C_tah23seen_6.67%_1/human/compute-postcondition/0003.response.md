Output State: **The list 'ans' contains the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans', or the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' plus the previous element in 'ans' if the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' is less than the corresponding element in 'arr', except for the last element which is the sum of the second last element in 'ans' and the last element in 'arr'. The first element of 'ans' is the first element of 'arr' plus 1. The list 'arr' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.**
