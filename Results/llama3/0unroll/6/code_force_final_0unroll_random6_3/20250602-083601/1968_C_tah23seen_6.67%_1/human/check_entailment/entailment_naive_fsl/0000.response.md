Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program outputs:

3 5 4 9

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 4 mod 5 is not equal to 1.

The issue with the program is in the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`. This line assumes that the next number in the sequence can be obtained by adding the current number to the previous number, which is not necessarily true.

A correct solution would involve finding a sequence of numbers that satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n, which may require a more complex algorithm.
