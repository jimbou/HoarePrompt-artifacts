This function generates a new list 'ans' based on the input list 'arr' and its length 'n'. It initializes the first element of 'ans' as the first element of 'arr' plus 1. Then, for each subsequent element in 'ans', it calculates the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans'. If this sum is less than the corresponding element in 'arr', it adds the previous element in 'ans' to the sum. The last element of 'ans' is calculated as the sum of the second last element in 'ans' and the last element in 'arr'. The function returns the list 'ans' without modifying the input list 'arr' or its length 'n'.
