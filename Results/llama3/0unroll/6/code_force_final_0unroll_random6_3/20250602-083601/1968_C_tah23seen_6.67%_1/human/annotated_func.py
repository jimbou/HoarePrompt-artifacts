#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 positive integers, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: The list 'ans' contains the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans', or the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' plus the previous element in 'ans' if the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' is less than the corresponding element in 'arr'. The first element of 'ans' is the first element of 'arr' plus 1. The list 'arr' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list 'ans' which contains the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans', or the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' plus the previous element in 'ans' if the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans' is less than the corresponding element in 'arr', except for the last element which is the sum of the second last element in 'ans' and the last element in 'arr'. The first element of 'ans' is the first element of 'arr' plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a new list 'ans' based on the input list 'arr' and its length 'n'. It initializes the first element of 'ans' as the first element of 'arr' plus 1. Then, for each subsequent element in 'ans', it calculates the sum of the corresponding element in 'arr' and the previous element in 'ans'. If this sum is less than the corresponding element in 'arr', it adds the previous element in 'ans' to the sum. The last element of 'ans' is calculated as the sum of the second last element in 'ans' and the last element in 'arr'. The function returns the list 'ans' without modifying the input list 'arr' or its length 'n'.
