Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports (d) as input. It modifies the row by incrementing the first element to 1, incrementing elements from index 1 to `d-1` by 2, and then for elements from index `d` to the end, it adds the value of the smallest element in a min-heap (containing the last `d` elements of the list) at the previous iteration and 1 to the original value. The function returns the last modified element of the list, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for the given row.

Function func_2 calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs for a given river configuration. It takes as input the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d), as well as a 2D list representing the river configuration. It applies func_1 to each row of the river to determine the costs, and then calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs.

The program correctly implements the problem description by using a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest element in the last `d` elements of the list, and by considering all possible consecutive rows of the river to find the minimum sum of k consecutive costs.

Correctness: **True**
