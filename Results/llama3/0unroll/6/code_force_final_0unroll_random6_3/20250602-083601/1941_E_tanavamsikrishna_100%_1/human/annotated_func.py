#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, d is a non-negative integer such that d < len(row).
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: The list `row` has all its elements from index 1 to `d-1` incremented by 2, while the first element remains 1 and the rest of the elements from index `d` to the end of the list remain unchanged.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]

    #State: Output State: The list `min_heap` is a valid min-heap containing the last `d` elements of `row`, with each element being a tuple of the value and its original index in `row`. The list `row` has been modified such that each element at index `i` (where `i` is greater than or equal to `d`) is the sum of the original value at that index, the value of the smallest element in the min-heap at the previous iteration, and 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which is the sum of the original value at that index, the value of the smallest element in the min-heap at the previous iteration, and 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by incrementing the first element to 1, incrementing elements from index 1 to `d-1` by 2, and then for elements from index `d` to the end, it adds the value of the smallest element in a min-heap (containing the last `d` elements of the list) at the previous iteration and 1 to the original value. The function returns the last modified element of the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]

    #State: Output State: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and d. total_costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of k consecutive integers in costs.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the minimum sum of k consecutive costs (where costs are the results of func_1 applied to each row in rows and d)

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs for a given river configuration, where costs are determined by applying func_1 to each row of the river and the maximum distance between supports (d). The function takes as input the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d), as well as a 2D list representing the river configuration. It returns the minimum sum of k consecutive costs.
