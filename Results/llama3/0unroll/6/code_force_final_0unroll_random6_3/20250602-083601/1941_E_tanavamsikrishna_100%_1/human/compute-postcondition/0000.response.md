Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and d. total_costs is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and d are updated based on the input provided, and rows is populated with the input data. The costs list is created by applying the func_1 function to each row in rows and the value of d. The total_costs list is initialized as an empty list.
