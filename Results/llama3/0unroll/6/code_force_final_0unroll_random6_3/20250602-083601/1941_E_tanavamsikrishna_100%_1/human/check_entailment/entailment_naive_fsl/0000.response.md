Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, specifically in the line where the minimum heap is updated. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. This condition is intended to remove elements from the heap that are no longer relevant, but it does not correctly account for the case where the distance between supports is exactly `d`.

For example, consider the input `row = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and `d = 4`. The correct output should be `4`, but the program outputs `5`.

The correct implementation of `func_1` should update the minimum heap by removing elements that are no longer relevant, taking into account the correct distance between supports. One possible correction is to change the condition to `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] < i - d:`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n`, which would result in an incorrect output. The program should add a check to ensure that `k` is not greater than `n` before calculating the total costs.

Overall, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
