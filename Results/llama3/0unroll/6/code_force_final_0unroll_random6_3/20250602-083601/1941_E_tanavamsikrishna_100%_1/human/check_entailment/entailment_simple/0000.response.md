Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

The program first defines a helper function `func_1` that calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. This function uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest element in the previous d elements, which is used to calculate the cost of installing a support at the current position.

The main function `func_2` reads the input, calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows. It keeps track of the minimum total cost found so far and prints it at the end.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 1, and it correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.

Correctness: **True**
