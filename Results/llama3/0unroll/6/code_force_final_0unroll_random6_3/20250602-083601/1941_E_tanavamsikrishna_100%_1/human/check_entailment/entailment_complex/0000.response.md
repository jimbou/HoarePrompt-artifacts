Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports (d) as input, and returns the minimum cost of installing supports for that row. It does this by maintaining a min-heap of the last d elements of the row, and for each element from index d to the end of the row, it adds the value of the smallest element in the min-heap at the previous iteration and 1 to the original value. This is a correct implementation of the problem description, which states that the cost of installing a support in a cell is the value of the cell plus 1, and that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d.

func_2 takes the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d) as input, as well as a 2D list representing the river configuration. It calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs for the given river configuration by applying func_1 to each row of the river and d, and then finding the minimum sum of k consecutive costs. This is also a correct implementation of the problem description, which states that Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, and that the total cost of installing supports is the sum of the costs of installing supports for each row.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
