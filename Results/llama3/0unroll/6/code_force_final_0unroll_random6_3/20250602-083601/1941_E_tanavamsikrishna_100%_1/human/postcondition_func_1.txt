Calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs for a given river configuration, where costs are determined by applying func_1 to each row of the river and the maximum distance between supports (d). The function takes as input the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d), as well as a 2D list representing the river configuration. It returns the minimum sum of k consecutive costs.
