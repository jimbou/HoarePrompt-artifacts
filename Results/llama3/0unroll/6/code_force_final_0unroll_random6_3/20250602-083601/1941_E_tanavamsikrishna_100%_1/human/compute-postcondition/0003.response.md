The code prints the minimum value from the list `total_costs`, which contains the sum of `k` consecutive integers from the list `costs`. Each integer in `costs` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to a row in the `rows` list and the maximum distance `d`.

Output: **the minimum sum of k consecutive costs (where costs are the results of func_1 applied to each row in rows and d)**
