This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by incrementing the first element to 1, incrementing elements from index 1 to `d-1` by 2, and then for elements from index `d` to the end, it adds the value of the smallest element in a min-heap (containing the last `d` elements of the list) at the previous iteration and 1 to the original value. The function returns the last modified element of the list.
