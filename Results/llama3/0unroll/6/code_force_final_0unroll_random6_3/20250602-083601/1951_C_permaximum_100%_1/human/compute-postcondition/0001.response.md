Output State: tickets_bought = k, total_cost = sum of the prices of the k cheapest tickets, price_increase = k.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of tickets bought (tickets_bought) is equal to k, the total cost (total_cost) is the sum of the prices of the k cheapest tickets, and the price increase (price_increase) is equal to k.
