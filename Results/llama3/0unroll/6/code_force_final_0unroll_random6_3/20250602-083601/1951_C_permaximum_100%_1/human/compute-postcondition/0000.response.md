Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n*m and less than or equal to 10^9, prices is a list of n integers, each integer in prices is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), pq is a min-heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from prices and its original index in prices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0**

The code initializes a min-heap `pq` with tuples containing prices from the `prices` list along with their original indices. It also initializes variables `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase` to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `prices` list remain unchanged.
