Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets for a concert, considering the constraints of the problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k).

3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list 'prices'.

4. The program defines a function 'func_1' that takes the parameters n, m, k, and prices.

5. Inside 'func_1', it creates a priority queue (pq) using the prices and their indices. The priority queue is a min-heap, meaning the smallest price will always be at the top.

6. It initializes variables to keep track of the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the price increase.

7. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets have been bought.

8. Inside the loop, it pops the smallest price from the priority queue, adds the current price increase to it, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day (which is the minimum of m and the remaining tickets to be bought).

9. It updates the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the price increase accordingly.

10. Once all tickets have been bought, the function returns the total cost.

11. The main program prints the result of 'func_1' for each test case.

The program seems to be correct as it considers the constraints of the problem and uses a priority queue to always choose the day with the smallest price. However, there is a logical error in the program.

The error lies in the way the program updates the price increase. The price increase should be the total number of tickets bought so far, not the number of tickets bought on the current day. This is because the price increase affects all subsequent days, not just the current day.

Correctness: **False**
