#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers, n >= 1, m >= 1, k >= 1, k <= n*m, k <= 10^9, prices is a list of n integers, each integer in prices is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: tickets_bought is equal to k, total_cost is the sum of the k smallest prices in prices plus the sum of the price increases for each ticket bought, price_increase is equal to k, pq is empty
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the k smallest prices in prices plus the sum of the price increases for each ticket bought, where k is the number of tickets bought, and the price increase is equal to k.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying k tickets with increasing prices, where the price increase is equal to the number of tickets bought. The function takes in a list of prices, the number of tickets to buy (k), and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day (m). It returns the sum of the k smallest prices in the list plus the sum of the price increases for each ticket bought.
