Output State: **tickets_bought is equal to k, total_cost is the sum of the k smallest prices in prices plus the sum of the price increases for each ticket bought, price_increase is equal to k, pq is empty**.

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has finished buying tickets, and the total cost is the sum of the k smallest prices in the prices list plus the sum of the price increases for each ticket bought. The price increase is equal to the number of tickets bought (k), and the priority queue (pq) is empty because all the prices have been popped out of it.
