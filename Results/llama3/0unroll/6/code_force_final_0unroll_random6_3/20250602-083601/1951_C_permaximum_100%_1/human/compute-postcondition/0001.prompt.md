Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n*m and less than or equal to 10^9, prices is a list of n integers, each integer in prices is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), pq is a min-heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from prices and its original index in prices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
