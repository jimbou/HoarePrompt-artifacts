Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the smallest price per ticket for each day. It iteratively buys the minimum of m tickets or the remaining tickets needed (k - tickets_bought) on the day with the smallest price, updates the total cost, and increases the price for subsequent days. The program correctly handles the constraints of buying no more than m tickets per day and the price increase for subsequent days.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys the tickets with the smallest price, which minimizes the total cost. The program also correctly updates the total cost and the price increase for each ticket bought.

Correctness: **True**
