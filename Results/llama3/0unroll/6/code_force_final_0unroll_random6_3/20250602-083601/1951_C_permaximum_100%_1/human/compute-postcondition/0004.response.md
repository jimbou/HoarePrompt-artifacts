Functionality: This function calculates the total cost of buying k tickets, where the cost of each ticket is determined by the k smallest prices in the given list of prices, and the price increases by the number of tickets bought so far. The function takes in four parameters: n (the number of prices), m (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single transaction), k (the total number of tickets to be bought), and prices (a list of n integers representing the prices of the tickets). The function returns the total cost of buying k tickets, considering the price increases after each purchase.
