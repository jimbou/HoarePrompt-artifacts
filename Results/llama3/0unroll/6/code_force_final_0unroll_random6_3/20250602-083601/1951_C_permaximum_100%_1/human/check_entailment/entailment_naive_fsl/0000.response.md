Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The problem statement specifies that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on a given day, but the program does not account for this increase when calculating the total cost.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will purchase 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4, and then purchase 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6. However, the price per ticket on the fourth day should be increased by 1 (the number of tickets purchased on the third day), making the total cost 7, not 6.

The program does not correctly update the prices of the tickets after each purchase, leading to incorrect calculations of the total cost.
