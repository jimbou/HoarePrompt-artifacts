Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the smallest price per ticket for each day. It then iteratively buys tickets on the day with the smallest price, increasing the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought. This approach ensures that the program buys the k tickets with the smallest total cost.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m) and the total number of tickets to be bought (k). It also correctly updates the price increase for each ticket bought, which affects the prices for subsequent days.

The program's time complexity is O(n log n) due to the use of a priority queue, where n is the number of days. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
