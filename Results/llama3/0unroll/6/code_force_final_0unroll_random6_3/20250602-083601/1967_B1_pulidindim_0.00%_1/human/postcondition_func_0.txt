The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving n and m for each test case, updating the result based on a conditional loop that increments a counter and modifies the result until a certain condition is met or the counter exceeds m. The function exhausts the standard input and leaves the variables in their final state after processing all test cases.
