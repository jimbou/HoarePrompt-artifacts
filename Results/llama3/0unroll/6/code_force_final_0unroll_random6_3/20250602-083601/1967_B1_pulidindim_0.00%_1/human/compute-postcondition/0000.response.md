The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). 

After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**
