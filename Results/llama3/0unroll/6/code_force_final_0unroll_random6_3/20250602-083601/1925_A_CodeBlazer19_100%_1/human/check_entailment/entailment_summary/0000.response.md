Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program reads the number of test cases t and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and k. It then generates a string s by repeating the first k lowercase English alphabets n times. This string s is such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. The program prints this string s for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program consumes all input from stdin and leaves it empty, and the output is a series of strings, with the number of strings equal to the value of t.

Correctness: **True**
