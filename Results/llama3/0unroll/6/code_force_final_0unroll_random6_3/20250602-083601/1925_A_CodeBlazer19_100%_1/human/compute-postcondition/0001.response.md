Output State: **The output will be a series of strings, each consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet repeated n times. The number of strings will be equal to the value of t. The value of t will be unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The input from stdin will be consumed by the loop, so stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.**
