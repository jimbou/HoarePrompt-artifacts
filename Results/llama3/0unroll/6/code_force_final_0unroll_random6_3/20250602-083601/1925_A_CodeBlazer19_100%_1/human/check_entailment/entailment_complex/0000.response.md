Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input from stdin, generates the required strings, and prints them to the output. The program's logic is sound, and it handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the required strings. It uses the `*` operator to repeat the string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats. It reads the input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t`, and each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints the generated strings to the output, with each string on a separate line.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
