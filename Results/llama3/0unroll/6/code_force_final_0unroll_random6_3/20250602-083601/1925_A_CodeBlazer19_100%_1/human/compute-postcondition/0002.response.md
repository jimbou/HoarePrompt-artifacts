Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then generates and prints t strings, each consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet repeated n times. The function consumes all input from stdin and leaves it empty. The output is a series of strings, with the number of strings equal to the value of t.**
