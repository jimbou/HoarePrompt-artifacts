Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the length of the strings and the number of lowercase English alphabets to use, respectively.
3. The program then prints a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times, the program ensures that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using these alphabets will occur as a subsequence of the resulting string `s`.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will print the string `"abab"`. This string contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"`).

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
