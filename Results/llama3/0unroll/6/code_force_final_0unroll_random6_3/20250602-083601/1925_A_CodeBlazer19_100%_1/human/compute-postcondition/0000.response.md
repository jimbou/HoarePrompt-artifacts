The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676). After accepting this integer, the stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**
