Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the input, calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points for each test case, and prints the minimum of these squared distances.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points, but it does not take the square root of these distances to get the actual lengths of the sides of the square. As a result, the program prints the squared distances instead of the area of the square.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the input coordinates do not form a square. Although the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates form a square, a robust program should still handle such cases.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
