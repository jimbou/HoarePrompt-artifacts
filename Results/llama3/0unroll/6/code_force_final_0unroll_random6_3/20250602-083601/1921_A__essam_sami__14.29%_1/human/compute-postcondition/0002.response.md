Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of four lines of two integers representing coordinates of a square's corners. It calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points for each test case and prints the minimum of these squared distances. The function does not modify the input value t.**
