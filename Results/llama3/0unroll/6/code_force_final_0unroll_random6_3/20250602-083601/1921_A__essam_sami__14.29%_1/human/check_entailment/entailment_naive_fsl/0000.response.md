Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) as assumed in the program. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) and between (4, 2) and (4, 5), which are not the correct sides of the square. The correct sides of the square are between (1, 2) and (4, 2) and between (1, 5) and (4, 5).

The program should find the correct sides of the square by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the input points, not by assuming a specific order.
