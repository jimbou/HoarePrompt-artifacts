The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` testcases. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, the remaining input in stdin will be `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000). 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000).**
