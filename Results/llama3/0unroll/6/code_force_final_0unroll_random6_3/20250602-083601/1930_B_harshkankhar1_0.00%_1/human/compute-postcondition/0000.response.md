Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to t (1 <= t <= 10^3) where all elements at even indices are in reverse order, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer (3 <= n <= 10^5)**.

Explanation: The first line of the code assigns a list of integers from 1 to t (inclusive) to the variable `a`. The second line reverses the order of elements at even indices in the list `a`. The stdin contains t lines each containing an integer (3 <= n <= 10^5) which is not affected by the code.
