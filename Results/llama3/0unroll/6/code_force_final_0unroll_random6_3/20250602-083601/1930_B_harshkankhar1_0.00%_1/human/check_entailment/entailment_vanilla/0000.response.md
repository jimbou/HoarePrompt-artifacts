Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The given program defines a function func_1() that takes an integer n as input and generates a permutation of length n. The function first creates a list a of numbers from 1 to n. Then, it reverses every other element in the list a starting from the first element (index 0). Finally, it prints the modified list a.

The key insight here is that by reversing every other element, the program ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation divide each other. This is because the reversed elements are now in a different order, breaking the divisibility relationship between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the input n = 4. The initial list a is [1, 2, 3, 4]. After reversing every other element, the list becomes [4, 1, 2, 3]. In this permutation, there are no two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the guarantee that at least one valid permutation exists for each input n.

Correctness: **True**
