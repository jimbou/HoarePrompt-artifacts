Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains n lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains n lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), which were present in the initial state. The value of `n` is now known and is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
