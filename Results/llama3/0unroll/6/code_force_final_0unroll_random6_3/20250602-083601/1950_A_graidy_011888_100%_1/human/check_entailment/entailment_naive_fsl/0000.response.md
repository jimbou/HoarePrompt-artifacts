Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks for the conditions a<b<c for a stair and a<b>c for a peak, and prints the corresponding output. The program also handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak, printing "NONE" in such cases.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible combinations of input digits. It does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect output. Therefore, the program is correct.
