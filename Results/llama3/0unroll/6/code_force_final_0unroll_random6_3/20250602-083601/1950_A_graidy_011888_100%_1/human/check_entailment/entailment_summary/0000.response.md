Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description. 

1. It checks if the digits form a stair by verifying if `a < b < c`, and if so, prints "STAIR".
2. It checks if the digits form a peak by verifying if `a < b` and `b > c`, and if so, prints "PEAK".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
