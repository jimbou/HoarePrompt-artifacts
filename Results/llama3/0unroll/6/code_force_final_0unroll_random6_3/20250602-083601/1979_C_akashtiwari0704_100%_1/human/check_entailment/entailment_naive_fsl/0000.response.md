Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where it is not possible to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, in which case it prints -1.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
