Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer, and the variable `stdin` is empty as all the test cases have been processed. The loop has printed the result for each test case, either -1 if the sum of the modified numbers is greater than or equal to their least common multiple, or a string of the modified numbers separated by spaces otherwise.
