Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. It also correctly checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The program uses the `//` operator for integer division, which can result in a zero division error if the LCM is zero. Although the problem statement guarantees that the multipliers are between 2 and 20, it is still possible for the LCM to be zero if the input is invalid.

Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on the assumption that the input is valid. If the input is guaranteed to be valid, the program is correct. Otherwise, the program may encounter a zero division error.

Correctness: **True** (assuming valid input)
