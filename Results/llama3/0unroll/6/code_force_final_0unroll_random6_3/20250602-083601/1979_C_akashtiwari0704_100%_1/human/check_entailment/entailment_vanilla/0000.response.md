Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers.

4. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the amount of coins received back for each outcome is equal to the LCM.

5. The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

6. If the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM, it prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the amount of coins received back for each outcome is equal to the LCM, which is greater than the total amount of coins bet. This satisfies the condition that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
