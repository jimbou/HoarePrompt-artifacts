Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to calculate the bets for each outcome. It first calculates the LCM of the multipliers for all outcomes, then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet for each outcome.

The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome separated by spaces.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized, making it more likely to come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
