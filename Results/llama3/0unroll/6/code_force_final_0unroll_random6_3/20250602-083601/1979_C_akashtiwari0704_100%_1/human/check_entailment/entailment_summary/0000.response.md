Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `a`.
2.  It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function. This is necessary to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
3.  The program then divides the LCM by each multiplier to produce a new list of bets. This is a valid strategy because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM, which is the minimum amount required to come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.
4.  The program checks if the sum of the new list of bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the new list of bets.
5.  The program processes all test cases and produces output for each case, leaving the standard input empty and the variable `t` unchanged.

Overall, the program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
