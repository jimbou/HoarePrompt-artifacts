Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers, then divides the LCM by each integer to produce a new list. If the sum of the new list is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the new list of integers separated by spaces. The function processes all test cases and produces output for each case, leaving the standard input empty and the variable t unchanged.**
