Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the standard output (stdout) contains the results of the loop's executions, which are either the string "-1" or a sequence of space-separated integers, depending on the input values. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still holding a positive integer value. The standard input (stdin) is empty, as all the test cases have been read and processed by the loop.
