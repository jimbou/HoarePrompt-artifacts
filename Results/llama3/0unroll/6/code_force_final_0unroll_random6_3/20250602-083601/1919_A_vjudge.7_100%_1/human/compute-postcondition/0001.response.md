Output State: **The output will be a series of 'Alice' and 'Bob' printed to the console, with the number of lines equal to the value of 'test'. Each line will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on whether the sum of the two integers on the corresponding line of stdin is odd or even, respectively. The value of 'test' remains unchanged.**
