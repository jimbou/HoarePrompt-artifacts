Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program uses a simple approach to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (&). If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

This approach is based on the observation that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move. Since the players alternate turns, the player who starts with the smaller number of coins will always be able to make the last move if the total number of coins is odd. If the total number of coins is even, the player who starts with the larger number of coins will always be able to make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
