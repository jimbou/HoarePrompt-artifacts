Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game's rules state that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who removes the last coin wins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have a chance to remove the last coin, and if it's odd, Alice will have that chance.

The program correctly implements this logic by using the bitwise AND operator to check the parity of the sum of the coins. The expression `a + b & 1` will be 0 if the sum is even and 1 if the sum is odd. The program then prints 'Bob' if the result is 0 and 'Alice' if the result is 1.

Correctness: **True**
