Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which happens when the total number of coins is odd.

The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This logic is correct because when the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make the last move, and when the sum is odd, Bob will always be forced to make the last move.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the number of coins in both wallets is the same, when one wallet has more coins than the other, and when the total number of coins is very large. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
