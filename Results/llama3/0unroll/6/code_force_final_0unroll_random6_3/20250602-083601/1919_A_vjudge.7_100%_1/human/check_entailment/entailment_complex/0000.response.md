Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd or even.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because the game is symmetric, and the players can always mirror each other's moves. The only difference is that Alice makes the first move, which gives her an advantage when the sum is odd.

The program correctly implements this parity check by using the bitwise AND operator (&) to check whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even (i.e., `a + b & 1 == 0`). If it is, the program prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly solves the problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
