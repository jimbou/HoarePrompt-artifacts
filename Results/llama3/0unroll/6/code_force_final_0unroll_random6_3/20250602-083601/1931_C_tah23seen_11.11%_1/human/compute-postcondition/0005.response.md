Output State: **i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged. i is less than or equal to j**

In this output state, the loop has iterated through the array until it found a mismatched element from the start of the array. The variable i now points to the index of this mismatched element. The variable j remains unchanged, still pointing to the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array. The array itself remains unchanged.
