Reasoning:

The given program is actually designed to find the length of the longest contiguous substring of a given list of integers that reads the same backward as forward, also known as a palindrome. However, the problem description is asking for the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

The program does not address the problem description at all. It does not consider the cost of the operation, which is (j - i + 1) burles, nor does it try to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
