Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will return 5, but the correct answer is 5. The program only checks if the first and last elements are equal, and if they are not, it returns the difference between the indices of the last and first elements that are not equal. However, this approach does not consider the case where the array can be made equal by replacing a subarray in the middle.

A correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal. The idea is to maintain a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index i to j equal. The final answer would be the minimum value in the last row of the dp array.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for length in range(1, n+1):
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if length == 1:
                dp[i][j] = 0
            elif arr[i] == arr[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[0][n-1]
```

This implementation correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal by considering all possible subarrays and their minimum operations.
