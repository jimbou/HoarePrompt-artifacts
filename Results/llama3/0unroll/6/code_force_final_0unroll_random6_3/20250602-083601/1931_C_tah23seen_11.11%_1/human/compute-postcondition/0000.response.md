Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, j is the last index of arr**

The code initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, and assigns them values based on the length of the list `arr`. The first line sets `i` to 0, which is the first index of `arr`. The second line sets `j` to the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged.
