#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the length of the longest contiguous substring of a given list of integers that reads the same backward as forward, also known as a palindrome. It returns 0 if the entire list is a palindrome, the number of elements between the first mismatched element and the current index j (inclusive) if the first mismatched element is not at the end of the list, or the difference between the last index of the list and the index of the first mismatched element if the first mismatched element is at the end of the list.
