Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" required to make all elements of an array equal by applying the operation of assigning all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x.

However, the program is incorrect. The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required. The function only checks if the array is already sorted in a specific way (i.e., the first and last elements are equal, and the array is non-decreasing from the first element to the last element), and if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the last index and the first index where the array is not sorted in this way.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to make the array elements equal. For example, it does not consider the case where the array can be made equal by assigning all elements the value of the most frequent element.

Moreover, the function `func_1(arr)` is not correctly implemented. The while loop `while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]: i += 1` will raise an `IndexError` when `i` reaches the last index of the array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
