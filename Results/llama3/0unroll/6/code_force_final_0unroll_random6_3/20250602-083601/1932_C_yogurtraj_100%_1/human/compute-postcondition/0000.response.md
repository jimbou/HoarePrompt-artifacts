Output State: **The output state will be a series of lines, each containing n integers representing the values of y for each test case. The values of y are calculated based on the input values of a, m, and t, and represent the result of the modular multiplication of the elements of a in the order specified by t, starting from the last element. The output state will have the same format as the initial state, with the addition of the calculated y values for each test case.**
