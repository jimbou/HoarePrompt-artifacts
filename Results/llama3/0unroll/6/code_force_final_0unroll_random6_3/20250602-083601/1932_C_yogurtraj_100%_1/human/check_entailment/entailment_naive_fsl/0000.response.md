Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string `t` contains only 'L' characters. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
4 6
3 1 4 2
LLLL
```

The program will output:

```
0 0 0 0
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
0 2 4 1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when the input string `t` contains only 'L' characters, and it does not correctly calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.
