Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of three lines: two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string t of length n. The function calculates the modular multiplication of the elements of a in the order specified by t, starting from the last element, and prints the resulting values for each test case. The output is a series of lines, each containing n integers representing the calculated values.**
