    #State: *`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` contains the sum of all elements in `arr` and the index of the last element in `arr`, `segments_variants` contains a list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment, `max_sum` is still -1, and `total_max_segment` is a list containing either the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum or -1 if the length of `total_max_segment` is 1.

    #The program returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum or -1 if the length of the list is 1. The maximum sum is calculated from the list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum. If no such segment exists, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list. It identifies segments in the list where the sum of the segment is greater than the sum of the previous segment, and keeps track of the maximum sum and its corresponding end index. If the maximum sum is found in a segment that starts at the beginning of the list, the function returns the maximum sum and the index of the last element in the list. If the maximum sum is found in a segment that does not start at the beginning of the list, the function returns the maximum sum and the index of the last element in the segment. If no segment with a positive sum is found, the function returns -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer and quantity is a non-negative integer.
    answer = 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer 'number' and a non-negative integer 'quantity' as input, and returns an integer 'answer'. The function performs some calculation using the input values and returns the result, which is stored in the variable 'answer'. The final state of the program is that the 'answer' variable holds the calculated result.
