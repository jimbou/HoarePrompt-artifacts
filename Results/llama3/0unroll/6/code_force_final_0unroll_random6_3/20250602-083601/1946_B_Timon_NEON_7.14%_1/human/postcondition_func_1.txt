This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum. If no such segment exists, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list. It identifies segments in the list where the sum of the segment is greater than the sum of the previous segment, and keeps track of the maximum sum and its corresponding end index. If the maximum sum is found in a segment that starts at the beginning of the list, the function returns the maximum sum and the index of the last element in the list. If the maximum sum is found in a segment that does not start at the beginning of the list, the function returns the maximum sum and the index of the last element in the segment. If no segment with a positive sum is found, the function returns -1.
