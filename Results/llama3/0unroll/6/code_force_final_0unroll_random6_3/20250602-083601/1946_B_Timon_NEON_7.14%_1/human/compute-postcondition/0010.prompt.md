You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment

    #State: Output State: The final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing is as follows: arr remains unchanged, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment contains the sum of all elements in arr and the index of the last element in arr, segments_variants contains a list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment, and max_sum is still -1.

        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: arr remains unchanged, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment contains the sum of all elements in arr and the index of the last element in arr, segments_variants contains a list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment, max_sum is still -1, total_max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: *`arr` remains unchanged, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` contains the sum of all elements in `arr` and the index of the last element in `arr`, `segments_variants` contains a list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment, `max_sum` is still -1, and `total_max_segment` is a list containing either the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum or -1 if the length of `total_max_segment` is 1.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum or -1 if the length of the list is 1. The maximum sum is calculated from the list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum or -1 if the length of the list is 1. The maximum sum is calculated from the list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
