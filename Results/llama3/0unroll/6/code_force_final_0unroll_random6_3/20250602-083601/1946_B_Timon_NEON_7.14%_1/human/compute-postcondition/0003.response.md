Output State: **arr remains unchanged, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment contains the sum of all elements in arr and the index of the last element in arr, segments_variants contains a list of segments where each segment is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment, max_sum is still -1, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.**

The first line appends a new segment to segments_variants, which is a combination of max_segment and the index of the last element in arr. The second line appends another new segment to segments_variants, which is a combination of new_segment and the index of the last element in arr. The third line assigns a new value to total_max_segment, which is a list containing -1.
