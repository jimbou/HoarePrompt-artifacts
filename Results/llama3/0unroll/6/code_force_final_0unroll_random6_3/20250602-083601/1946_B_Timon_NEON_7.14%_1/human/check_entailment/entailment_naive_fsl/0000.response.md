Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations to find the maximum sum.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers and k is greater than 1. In this case, the program should select the maximum subarray sum and add it to the array k times, but the current implementation does not do this.

For example, if the input array is [-4, -7] and k is 2, the program should output 999999996, but the current implementation does not produce this result.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input array is empty or contains only one element. In these cases, the program should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.

Overall, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, and it does not handle all possible input cases.
