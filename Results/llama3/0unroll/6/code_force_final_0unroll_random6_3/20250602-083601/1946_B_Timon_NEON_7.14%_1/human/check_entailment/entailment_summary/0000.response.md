Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_1 takes an integer as input and returns the remainder of the integer divided by 1000000007. This function is used to ensure that the final answer is within the range of 0 to 1000000006.

Func_2 takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of all segments and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum. If no such segment exists, it returns -1. This function is used to find the maximum sum of a segment in the array.

Func_3 is not used in the given program.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls func_2 to find the maximum sum of a segment, and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The calculation involves multiplying the maximum sum of the segment by 2^k and adding the sum of the array minus the maximum sum of the segment. The result is then passed to func_1 to ensure that it is within the required range.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
