Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the input `b` is even or not, and returns 'yes' for even numbers and 'no' for odd numbers. However, this does not accurately solve the problem. The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program does not take into account the size of `a` or the relationship between `a` and `b`. It also does not consider the possibility of rotating the rectangles.

For example, the input `3 2` should return 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1` rectangles and then rearranged to form a `1 x 6` rectangle. However, the program would return 'no' because `2` is not even.

Correctness: **False**
