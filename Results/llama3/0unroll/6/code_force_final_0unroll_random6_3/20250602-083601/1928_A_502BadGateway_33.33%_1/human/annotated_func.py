#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is an even positive integer, otherwise it returns 'no'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given positive integer b is even or not, returning 'yes' for even numbers and 'no' for odd numbers, without modifying the input variables a and b.
