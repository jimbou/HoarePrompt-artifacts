Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 2, the program outputs 'no', but according to the problem description, the 3 x 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 x 1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 x 6 rectangle can be formed, which is a different rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the width (b) is even, but it does not consider the case where the length (a) is even. In the case of 3 2, the length (a) is odd, but the width (b) is even, so the program incorrectly outputs 'no'.

A correct solution would need to consider both the length and width of the rectangle, and check if either of them is even, or if the greatest common divisor of the length and width is greater than 1.
