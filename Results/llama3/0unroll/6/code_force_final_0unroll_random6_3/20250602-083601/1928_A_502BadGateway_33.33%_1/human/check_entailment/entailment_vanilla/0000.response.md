Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the width of the rectangle (b) is even. If it is, the program outputs 'yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If the width is odd, the program outputs 'no'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not guarantee that the width of the rectangle will always be even when another rectangle can be formed. In fact, the example input (3, 2) shows that a rectangle with an odd width can still be cut into two rectangles that can form another rectangle.

Moreover, the program does not consider the length of the rectangle (a) at all, which is also an important factor in determining whether another rectangle can be formed.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
