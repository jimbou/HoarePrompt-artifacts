Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can obtain another rectangle.

For example, if `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a/2` x `b`, and then form a rectangle of size `a` x `b/2` by rotating and moving the two rectangles. Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a` x `b/2`, and then form a rectangle of size `a/2` x `b` by rotating and moving the two rectangles.

Therefore, the correct function should return 'yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, not just if `b` is even.

Correctness: **False**
