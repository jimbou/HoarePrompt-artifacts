stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
