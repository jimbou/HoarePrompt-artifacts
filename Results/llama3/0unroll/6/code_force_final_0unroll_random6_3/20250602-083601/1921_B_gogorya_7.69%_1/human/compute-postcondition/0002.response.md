Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, and two strings s and f of length n. It calculates the minimum number of cats that need to be moved to make the number of cats in each box equal, and prints this number to the console for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the input buffer.**
