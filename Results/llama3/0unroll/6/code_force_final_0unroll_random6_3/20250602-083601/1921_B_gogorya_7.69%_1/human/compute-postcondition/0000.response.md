Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
