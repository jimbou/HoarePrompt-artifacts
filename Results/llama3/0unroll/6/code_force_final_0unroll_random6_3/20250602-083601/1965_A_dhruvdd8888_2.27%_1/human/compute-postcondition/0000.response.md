Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable `N` holds a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The variable `nums` is a sorted list of positive integers, which are the input numbers for each test case. The `stdin` now contains `t` lines, where `t` is a positive integer, each line containing a positive integer `n`, followed by `n` positive integers.
