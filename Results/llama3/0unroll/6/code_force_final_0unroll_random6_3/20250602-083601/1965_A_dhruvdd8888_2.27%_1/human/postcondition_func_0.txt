This function determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of positive integers. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a sequence of positive integers. The function then analyzes the sequence to determine the winner, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', and prints the result. The function returns None in all cases except when the input sequence contains only one element, in which case it returns the string 'Alice'.
