Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the value of x. The formula used is incorrect and does not take into account the gcd(a, b) condition.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, calculate the gcd(a, b), and check if a+b is a multiple of b*gcd(a, b). However, this approach would be inefficient due to the large range of n and m.

A more efficient approach would be to use the fact that a+b is a multiple of b*gcd(a, b) if and only if a is a multiple of gcd(a, b). This can be used to reduce the problem to counting the number of multiples of gcd(a, b) in the range [1, n] for each possible value of b.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            for j in range(1, a + 1):
                if math.gcd(j, i) == j and (j + i) % (i * math.gcd(j, i)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)
```

This program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. However, it is still inefficient due to the nested loops. A more efficient solution would require a different approach.
