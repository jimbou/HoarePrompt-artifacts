Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of i from 1 to b, and for each i, it calculates the value of x using the formula:

x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

If x is positive, it adds x to the sum. Additionally, if the remainder of (a - i * (i - 1)) divided by i ** 2 is 0, and the remainder of i * (i - 1) divided by i ** 2 is also 0, it adds 1 to the sum.

However, the program then prints the sum minus 2, which is incorrect. The correct solution should print the sum as is, without subtracting 2.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
