Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `i`. The program uses the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs for each `i`.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program is subtracting 2 from the final result, which is not justified by the problem statement. This subtraction is likely an attempt to correct for some error, but it is not clear what error it is trying to correct.
2. The program is using the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs for each `i`. However, this formula is not correct. The correct formula should be based on the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)`.
3. The program is not correctly handling the case where `a` is less than `i * (i - 1)`. In this case, the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` will produce a negative result, which is not valid.

Overall, the program is not correctly solving the problem, and the subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified.

Correctness: **False**
