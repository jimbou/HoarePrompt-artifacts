#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). Each value of X is a positive integer (2 <= X <= 10^18).
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens, stdin is empty
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` extended with all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, stdin is empty
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has printed all the elements of `ansv` to the console, separated by spaces, and the length of `ansv` is printed. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads two inputs from stdin: an integer (the number of test cases) and a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). It then processes these values to generate a list of integers (ansv) and prints the length of this list followed by its elements, separated by spaces. The function does not return any value but instead prints the output directly to the console.
