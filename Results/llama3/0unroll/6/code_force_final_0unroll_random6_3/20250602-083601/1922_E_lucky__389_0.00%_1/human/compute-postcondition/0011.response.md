Functionality: **This function reads two inputs from stdin: an integer (the number of test cases) and a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). It then processes these values to generate a list of integers (ansv) and prints the length of this list followed by its elements, separated by spaces. The function does not return any value but instead prints the output directly to the console.**
