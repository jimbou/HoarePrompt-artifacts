The code prints the length of the list `ansv`. The list `ansv` is created by extending a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. Since `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, the length of `ansv` will be equal to `mx` plus the number of elements in `subseq_lens` minus one.

Output: **mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1**
