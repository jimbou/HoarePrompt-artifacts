Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 3. The program outputs [0, 1, 0], but this array has 4 increasing subsequences ([], [0], [1], [0, 1]), not 3. 

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when X is a power of 2 minus 1. In this case, the program should output an array with a single element, but instead it outputs an array with multiple elements. 

For example, when X is 3, the program should output [0], but instead it outputs [0, 1, 0]. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
