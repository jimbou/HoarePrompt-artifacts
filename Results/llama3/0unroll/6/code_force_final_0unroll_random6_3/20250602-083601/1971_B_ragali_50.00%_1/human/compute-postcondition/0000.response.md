Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The stdin now contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The other information from the precondition is still valid after the code has been executed.
