Output State: **The output state is a series of strings, where each string is either 'NO' or a modified version of the input string. If the input string has more than one unique character, the output is 'YES' followed by a modified string. The modified string is either the input string rotated by half its length, its reverse, or the input string with the first half and second half swapped, depending on which modification results in a different string. If the input string has only one unique character, the output is 'NO'. The number of output strings is equal to the value of 't', which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
