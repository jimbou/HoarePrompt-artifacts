Functionality: **The function reads an integer 't' from standard input, representing the number of strings to process. It then reads 't' strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters. For each string, if it contains more than one unique character, the function prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string. The modification is either a rotation of the string by half its length, its reverse, or the string with its first and second halves swapped, depending on which modification results in a different string. If the string has only one unique character, the function prints 'NO'. The function processes 't' strings in this manner, where 't' is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
