Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. It handles cases where the string has only one unique character, in which case it outputs "NO", and cases where the string has more than one unique character, in which case it outputs "YES" followed by a modified version of the string. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the modified string is the same as the original string, in which case it tries alternative modifications.

Correctness: **True**
