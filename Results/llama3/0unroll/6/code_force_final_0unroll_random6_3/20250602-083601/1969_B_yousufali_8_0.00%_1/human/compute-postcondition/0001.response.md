Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and each time it will call the function `func_1()`. The output state will be the result of the last execution of `func_1()`. Since the problem doesn't specify what `func_1()` does, the output state cannot be determined. However, it can be said that the output state will be the result of `t` executions of `func_1()`, with the input being the binary strings from stdin.**
