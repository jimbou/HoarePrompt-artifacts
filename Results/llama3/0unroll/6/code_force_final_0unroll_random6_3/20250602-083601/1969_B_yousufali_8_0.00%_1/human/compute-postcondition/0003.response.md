Based on the precondition, the list `s` remains unchanged, `n` is the total number of 1's in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of the number of 1's in each sequence of 1's in the list `s` plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the number of 1's in each sequence of 1's in the list `s` plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.

Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **the sum of the number of 1's in each sequence of 1's in the list s plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's**
