The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` binary strings.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value read from the standard input. The standard input now contains `t` binary strings, each consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` binary strings (each consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5**
