Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` calculates the sum of the number of 1's in each sequence of 1's in a given list of binary integers, plus the number of 0's that immediately follow each sequence of 1's. This is equivalent to finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` binary strings, and executes `func_1()` `t` times. This is equivalent to solving the problem for `t` test cases.

Since `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for a single test case, and `func_2()` correctly executes `func_1()` for multiple test cases, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
