Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks for the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the program does not consider the optimal strategy to achieve this.

The program simply counts the number of 1's in the string and adds 1 to the count whenever it encounters a 0 after a 1. This approach does not take into account the fact that a single cyclic shift can move multiple 1's to their correct positions.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The program will output 5, but the correct answer is 3. The optimal strategy is to perform a cyclic shift on the substring "101" to get "011", and then perform another cyclic shift on the substring "011" to get "110". This requires a total cost of 3, not 5.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
