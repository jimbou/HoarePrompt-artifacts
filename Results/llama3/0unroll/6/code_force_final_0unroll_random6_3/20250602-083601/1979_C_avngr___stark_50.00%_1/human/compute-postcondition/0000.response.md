Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and the length of the list is the number of outcomes, `hcf` is the first integer in the list `numbers`.**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` is now equal to the first integer in the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` remains unchanged, and its properties (being a list of integers representing multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and having a length equal to the number of outcomes) are still valid.
