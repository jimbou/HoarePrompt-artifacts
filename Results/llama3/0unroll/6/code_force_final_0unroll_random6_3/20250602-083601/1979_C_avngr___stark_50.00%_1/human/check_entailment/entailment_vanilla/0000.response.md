Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`) for each outcome.
3.  It calculates the least common multiple (`m`) of all the multipliers (`k`). This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.
4.  It then calculates the initial bets (`c`) for each outcome by dividing the least common multiple (`m`) by the multiplier (`k`) for each outcome.
5.  The program then finds the highest common factor (`hcf`) of all the initial bets (`c`) using the `func_1` function. This function uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers and then applies it to all the numbers in the list.
6.  The program then divides each initial bet (`c`) by the highest common factor (`hcf`) to get the final bets.
7.  If the sum of the final bets is greater than or equal to the least common multiple (`m`) divided by the highest common factor (`hcf`), the program prints `-1`, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
8.  Otherwise, the program prints the final bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
