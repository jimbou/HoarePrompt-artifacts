Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for the coin amounts in different outcomes and then finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these LCMs. This GCD is used to divide the LCMs to obtain the minimum amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM divided by the GCD, the program prints the amounts of coins to be bet on each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly implements the mathematical concept of LCM and GCD to solve the problem. The use of the math.gcd function to calculate the GCD is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
