Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to calculate the bets for each outcome. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each number in the set. In this case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers for each outcome and then divides it by each multiplier to get the bet for that outcome.

The program also uses the concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the bets. The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides each number in the set without leaving a remainder. By dividing the bets by the GCD, the program can simplify the bets and reduce the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1 to indicate that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
