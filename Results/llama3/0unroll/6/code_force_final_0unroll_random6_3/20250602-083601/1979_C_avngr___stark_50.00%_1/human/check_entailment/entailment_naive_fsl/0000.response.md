Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input and outputs the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program also calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the bets and divides each bet by the HCF to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is not, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it outputs the bets for each outcome.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the potential cases. It correctly calculates the LCM and HCF, and it correctly checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the HCF. The program also correctly outputs the bets for each outcome or -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
