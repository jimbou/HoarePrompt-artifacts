Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.

2. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the multipliers, which is the largest number that divides all the multipliers without leaving a remainder.

3. The program then divides each multiplier by the GCD to get the smallest possible bet for each outcome. This is because the GCD is the largest number that divides all the multipliers, so dividing each multiplier by the GCD will give the smallest possible bet for each outcome.

4. The program then checks if the sum of all the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, then the program prints out the bets for each outcome. If it's not, then the program prints out -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

5. The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the GCD of two numbers, which is a built-in function in Python.

6. The program also uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the GCD of a list of numbers, which is not shown in the code snippet but is presumably defined elsewhere in the program.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
