#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and the length of the list is the number of outcomes.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and the length of the list is the number of outcomes, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all the integers in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all the integers in the list `numbers`, which is the highest common factor that can divide all the multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers representing multipliers for coin amounts in different outcomes, which is the highest common factor that can divide all the multipliers.
