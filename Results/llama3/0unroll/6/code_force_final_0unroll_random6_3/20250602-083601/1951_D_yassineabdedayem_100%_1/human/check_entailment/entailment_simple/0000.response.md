Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. If `n == k`, it means Alice has exactly the number of coins needed to buy `k` jewels. In this case, the program correctly outputs "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy `k` jewels.

2. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it means that Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels and still have some coins left over. In this case, the program correctly outputs "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, which allows Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels and leaves her with 1 coin. The second stall has a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining 1 jewel.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels, or she would have to spend all her coins to buy `k` jewels, but she would not be able to buy any more jewels after that. In this case, the program correctly outputs "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
