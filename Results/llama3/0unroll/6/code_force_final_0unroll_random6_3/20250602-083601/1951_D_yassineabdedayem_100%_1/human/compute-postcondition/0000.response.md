Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) â€” the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end, respectively.
