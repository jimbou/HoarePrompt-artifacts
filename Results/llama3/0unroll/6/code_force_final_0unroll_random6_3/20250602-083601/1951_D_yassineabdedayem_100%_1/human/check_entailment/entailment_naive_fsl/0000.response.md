Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 7 and k = 3, the program prints "YES" and the prices 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11, but this is not a valid solution because Alice will only buy 3 jewels at the first stall and will not have enough coins to buy any jewels at the remaining stalls.

A correct solution would be to print "YES" and the prices 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, where Alice buys 3 jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at each of the remaining 9 stalls.

The program also does not work correctly when n = 6 and k = 4, because it prints "NO" but a valid solution exists: print "YES" and the prices 1 1 1 1 1 1.

The program only checks for two specific cases: when n equals k, and when n + 2 is greater than k * 2. However, there are other cases that are not covered by these conditions, and the program does not provide a correct solution for these cases.
