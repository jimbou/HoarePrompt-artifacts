Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it's possible for Alice to buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the minimum number of coins needed to buy the jewels if possible, or 'NO' if not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `n == k`, it means Alice has exactly enough coins to buy `k` jewels, so the program prints 'YES' and the minimum number of coins needed is 1.

2. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it means Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels and still have some coins left. In this case, the program prints 'YES' and the minimum number of coins needed is `n - k + 1` for the first stall and 1 for the second stall.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels, so the program prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
