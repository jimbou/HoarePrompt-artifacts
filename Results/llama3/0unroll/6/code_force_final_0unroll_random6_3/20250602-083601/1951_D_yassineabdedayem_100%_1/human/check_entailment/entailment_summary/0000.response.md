Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it's possible for Alice to buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the minimum number of coins needed to buy the jewels if possible, or 'NO' if not.

The program first checks if Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy. If so, it prints 'YES' and the minimum number of coins needed is 1.

If not, it checks if the number of coins Alice has is greater than or equal to twice the number of jewels she wants to buy minus 2. If so, it prints 'YES' and the minimum number of coins needed is the number of coins Alice has minus the number of jewels she wants to buy plus 1, and 1.

If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
