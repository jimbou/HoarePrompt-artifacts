Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks for the conditions a<b<c for a stair and a<b>c for a peak, and prints the corresponding output. The program also handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak, printing "NONE" in such cases.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect output. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
