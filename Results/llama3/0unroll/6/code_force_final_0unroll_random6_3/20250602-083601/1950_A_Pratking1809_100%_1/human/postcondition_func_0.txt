This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines of input, each containing three digits a, b, and c. It then classifies each triplet as 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of a, b, and c, and prints the classification for each triplet. The function does not return any value but produces output for each input triplet.
