Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains q lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `q` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains q lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), which were initially present in the input. The values of the other variables are not affected.
