Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost. The program increments the cost whenever it encounters a 0 and there is at least one 1 to its left, or whenever it encounters a 1 and there are still zeroes to its right. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string, which is to perform cyclic shifts on substrings.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The program calculates the cost as 5, but the correct minimum cost is 3, which can be achieved by performing the following operations:

1. Choose substring [1, 3]: 101011 → 011011
2. Choose substring [2, 4]: 011011 → 001111
3. Choose substring [3, 5]: 001111 → 000111

The total cost of these operations is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is not the same as the cost calculated by the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
