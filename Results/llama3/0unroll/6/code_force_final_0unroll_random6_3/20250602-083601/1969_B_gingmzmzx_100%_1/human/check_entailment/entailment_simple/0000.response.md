Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
3. It initializes variables to count the number of zeroes in the string and to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
4. It iterates over the string, updating the count of 0s and 1s and calculating the answer `ans`. The calculation is correct because it adds 1 to `ans` whenever it encounters a 0 that is preceded by at least one 1 (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), and it adds the number of 0s that are followed by at least one 1 (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) whenever it encounters a 1.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated answer `ans` for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required calculation. The output state matches the expected output, which is the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
