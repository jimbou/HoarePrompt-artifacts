This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, where the number of strings is specified by an initial integer. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the sum of two counts: the number of 1s that are immediately preceded by at least one 0, and the number of 0s that are immediately followed by at least one 1. The function processes each string independently and outputs the calculated sums for each string.
