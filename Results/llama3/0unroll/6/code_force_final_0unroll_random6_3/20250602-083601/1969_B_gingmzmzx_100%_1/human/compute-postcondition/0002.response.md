Functionality: This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of binary strings to process. For each binary string s, it calculates and prints the sum of two values: the number of 1s in s that are preceded by at least one 0, and the number of 0s in s that are followed by at least one 1. The function repeats this process t times, producing t output values.
