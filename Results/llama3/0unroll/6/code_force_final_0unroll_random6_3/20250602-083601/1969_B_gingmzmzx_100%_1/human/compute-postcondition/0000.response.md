Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), where t is equal to the value of `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t binary strings s, where t is equal to the value of `n`. The length of each binary string s is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
