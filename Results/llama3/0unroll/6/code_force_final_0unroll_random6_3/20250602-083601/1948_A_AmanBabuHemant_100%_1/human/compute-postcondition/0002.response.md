Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, determines whether each integer is even or odd, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If the integer is even and the length of a string of 'AAB' repeated n/2 times is less than 200, it prints the string; otherwise, it only prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple inputs based on an initial count provided by the user.**
