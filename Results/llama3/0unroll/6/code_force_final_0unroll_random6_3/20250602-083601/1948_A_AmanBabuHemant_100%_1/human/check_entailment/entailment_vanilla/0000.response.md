Reasoning:

1. The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.

4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern has 2 special characters ('A' and 'A'), so repeating it `n // 2` times will result in a string with exactly `n` special characters.

5. The program then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' and the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.

6. However, the problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be shown that there is an answer of length at most 200. Therefore, the check for the length of `s` is unnecessary and can be removed.

7. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
