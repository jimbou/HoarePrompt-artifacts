Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated n/2 times, for each input integer n. The responses are determined by whether n is even or odd, and whether the length of the string is less than 200. The initial value of t is not changed, and the input integers n are consumed by the loop.**
