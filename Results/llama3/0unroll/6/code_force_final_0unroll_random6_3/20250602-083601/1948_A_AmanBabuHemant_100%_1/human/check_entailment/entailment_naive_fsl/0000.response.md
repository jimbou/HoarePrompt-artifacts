Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases according to the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and checks if it's odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
3. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n/2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.
4. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
* If `n` is even, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters and prints it if its length is less than 200.
* If the length of the constructed string is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
