Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer and a list of positive integers. It then processes each test case to find the maximum possible length of a subarray that can be obtained by removing the first and last elements of the array, or the entire array if the first and last elements are the same. The function prints the maximum possible length for each test case, which can be 0 or more.**
