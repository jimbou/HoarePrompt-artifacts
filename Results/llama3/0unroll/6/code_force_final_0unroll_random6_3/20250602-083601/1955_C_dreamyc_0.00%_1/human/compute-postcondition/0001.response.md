Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, len(nums) is a non-negative integer, ans is a non-negative integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that k is a non-negative integer, the length of the deque nums is a non-negative integer, and ans is a non-negative integer. This means that the loop has terminated, and the values of k, len(nums), and ans have been updated accordingly. The values of n and the initial elements of nums are unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
