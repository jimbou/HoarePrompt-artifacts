Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and determines the number of ships sunk. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. It also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink a ship, and it breaks the loop when there is only one ship left or when the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink any more ships.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of ships is 1, or when the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink any ships.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
