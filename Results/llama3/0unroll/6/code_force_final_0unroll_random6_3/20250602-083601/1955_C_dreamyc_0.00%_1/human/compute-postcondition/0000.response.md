Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue data structure. This means that `nums` can now be efficiently appended or popped from both ends. The second line initializes a variable `ans` to 0.

Since `n` and `k` are not modified by the code, they remain positive integers. The value of `nums` is updated to be a deque of `n` positive integers, and a new variable `ans` is introduced with a value of 0.
