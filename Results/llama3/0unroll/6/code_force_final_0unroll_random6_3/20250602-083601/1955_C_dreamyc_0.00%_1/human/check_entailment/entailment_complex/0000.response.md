Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and returns the number of ships that were sunk.

The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add elements from both ends of the list. It also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink a ship, and the case where the Kraken's attack is enough to sink a ship.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there is only one ship left, or when the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink any ships.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
