This function calculates and prints the number of screens required to display a series of input pairs (x, y), where x and y are integers representing the dimensions of a display area. It reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y. For each pair (x, y), it calculates the total space required, determines the number of screens needed to display the pair, and appends this value to a result list. Finally, it prints the result list, containing the number of screens required for each input pair, one value per line.
