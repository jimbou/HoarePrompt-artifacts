Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the input is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` becomes an integer within this range. The second line initializes an empty list `result`. No other variables are affected. After the execution of the code, `n` has a value between 1 and 10^4, `result` is an empty list, and stdin contains `t-1` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).
