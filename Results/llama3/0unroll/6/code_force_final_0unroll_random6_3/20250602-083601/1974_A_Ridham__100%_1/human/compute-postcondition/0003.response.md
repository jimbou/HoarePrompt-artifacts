Based on the precondition, the list "result" contains n integers, each representing the number of screens required to display the corresponding input pair (x, y). The value of n remains unchanged.

When the print statement `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` is executed, it will print the elements of the "result" list, separated by newline characters ('\n').

Since the "result" list contains n integers, the print statement will output n lines, each containing a single integer representing the number of screens required to display the corresponding input pair (x, y).

Output: **n lines, each containing an integer representing the number of screens required to display the corresponding input pair (x, y)**
