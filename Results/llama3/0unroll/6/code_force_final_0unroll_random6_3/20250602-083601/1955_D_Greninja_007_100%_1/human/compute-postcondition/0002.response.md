Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of sorted list `a`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, and `ca` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `sm` is still the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`, and it is still greater than or equal to `k`.
