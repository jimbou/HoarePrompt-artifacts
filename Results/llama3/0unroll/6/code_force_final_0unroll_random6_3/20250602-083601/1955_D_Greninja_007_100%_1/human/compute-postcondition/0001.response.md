Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of sorted list a, ans is 0, and the current value of sm is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first m elements of a and b, and sm is greater than or equal to k.***
