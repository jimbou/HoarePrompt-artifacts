Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the occurrences of each number in the input list. It then iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to n (exclusive), where n is the length of the input list. 

For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not present in the Counter object (i.e., it is missing from the list). If it finds such a number, it prints it and breaks out of the loop. 

If it doesn't find any missing numbers, it checks if the current number i appears only once in the list (i.e., its count in the Counter object is 1). If it finds such a number and it's not the first number it has checked (i.e., the 'first' flag is True), it prints this number and breaks out of the loop. 

If it doesn't find any missing numbers or numbers that appear only once, it will print the smallest number that appears more than once in the list. 

This logic is correct because it follows the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score. If there are missing numbers in the list, Alice should choose the smallest missing number to maximize the score. If there are no missing numbers, Alice should choose the smallest number that appears only once in the list, because this will ensure that the MEX of her list is as large as possible. 

Correctness: **True**
