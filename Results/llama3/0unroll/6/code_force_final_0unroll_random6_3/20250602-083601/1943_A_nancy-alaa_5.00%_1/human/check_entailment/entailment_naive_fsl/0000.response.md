Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it is the MEX and the program prints it. If a number is present in the array and its frequency is 1, and it is the second such number (i.e., `first` is True), then it is the MEX and the program prints it. This is because Alice can choose the first number with frequency 1, and then Bob will choose the second number with frequency 1, and Alice will choose the MEX.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are no numbers with frequency 1, the program will print the first number that is not present in the array, which is the MEX.
* If there is only one number with frequency 1, the program will print that number, which is the MEX.
* If there are multiple numbers with frequency 1, the program will print the second such number, which is the MEX.

The program also handles the case where the input array is empty, in which case the MEX is 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game and handles all possible cases correctly.
