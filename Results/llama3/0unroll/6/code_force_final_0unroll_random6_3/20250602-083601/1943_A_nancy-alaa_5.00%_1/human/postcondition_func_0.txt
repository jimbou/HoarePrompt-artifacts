This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it finds and prints the smallest missing number in the list. If no number is missing, it prints the smallest number that appears only once in the list. If no such number exists, it prints the smallest number that appears more than once in the list.
