Output State: **T is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers. n and k are positive integers, k is less than or equal to 10^15, n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The integers in the list are positive and less than or equal to 10^9.**
