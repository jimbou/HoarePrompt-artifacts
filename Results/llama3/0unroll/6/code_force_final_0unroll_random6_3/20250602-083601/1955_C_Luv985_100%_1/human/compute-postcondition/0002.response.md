Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers. It then calculates the maximum number of integers that can be completely removed from the list by iteratively subtracting the minimum of the first and last elements from both ends, considering the constraint of k. The function prints the total number of removable integers for each test case.**
