Output State: **The final output state is the total number of integers that can be completely removed from the list by subtracting the minimum of the first and last elements from both ends, considering the constraint of k.**

In this output state, the loop iterates through each test case and calculates the maximum number of integers that can be removed from the list by repeatedly subtracting the minimum of the first and last elements from both ends, considering the constraint of k. The loop keeps track of the number of removed integers in the variable "ans" and prints the total count at the end of each test case.
