Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers where each element is equal to its original value minus the sum of all the previous elements, ls is equal to the sum of all the original elements in nums, nw is True, cw is True.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a boolean value to a variable. The first line sets `nw` to `True`, and the second line sets `cw` to `True`. These assignments do not affect the values of `N`, `nums`, or `ls`, which remain unchanged from their initial state. The final state includes the original values of `N`, `nums`, and `ls`, along with the newly assigned values of `nw` and `cw`.
