Output State: **N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, ls is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer, this line does not change the fact that `N` is a positive integer. The second line assigns to `nums` a set of strings representing the list of integers from stdin. The third line adds the string '0' to the set `nums`. The fourth line converts all the strings in `nums` to integers and sorts them in ascending order. The fifth line assigns 0 to `ls`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer, the list `nums` will contain `N+1` positive integers. The value of `ls` is 0. Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
