Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a single pile with an even number of stones. In this case, the program will print "Alice" because it thinks Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, but actually, Bob can win by choosing k=2 on his turn.

For example, if the input is:

1
2

The program will print "Alice", but the correct answer is "Bob".

The issue is that the program is not correctly implementing the game logic. It is not considering the case where the smallest nonempty pile has an even number of stones, and it is not correctly determining the winner in this case.
