Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of integers. It takes a positive integer N and a list of N positive integers as input, modifies the list by subtracting the sum of all previous elements from each element, and then checks the modified list from right to left. If the second last element is 1, the function prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The function does not return any value, it only prints the winner's name.**
