Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw. It iterates over the throws, updating the set of possible positions based on the distance and direction of each throw. If the direction is unknown ('?'), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. After all throws, it prints the number of unique possible positions and the positions themselves in ascending order.

The program correctly handles the case where the possible position is 0, replacing it with n, as the problem statement requires the positions to be numbered from 1 to n.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
