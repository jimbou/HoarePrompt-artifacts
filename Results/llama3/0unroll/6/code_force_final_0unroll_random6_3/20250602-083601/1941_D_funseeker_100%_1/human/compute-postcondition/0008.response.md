The code prints the elements of the set `ans` in ascending order. The set `ans` contains all possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n`, where `ri` is the result of `func_1()` for each iteration of the loop. If 0 is in `ans`, then 0 is excluded from `ans` and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and the results of `func_1()` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the unique values in `ans` in ascending order.

Output: **the unique values in ans in ascending order (where ans is the set containing all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, with 0 excluded and n included if 0 is present)**
