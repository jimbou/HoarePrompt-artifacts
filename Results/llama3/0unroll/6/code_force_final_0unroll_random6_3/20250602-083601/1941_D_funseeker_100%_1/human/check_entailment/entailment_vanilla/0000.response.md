Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program defines four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. These functions are used to read input from the standard input.

2. `func_1` reads a line from the standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.

3. `func_2` reads an integer from the standard input.

4. `func_3` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list.

5. `func_4` is the main function that solves the problem. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`. It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player.

6. The function then iterates over each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the player that is `r` positions ahead of each player in `ans` to a temporary set `temp`. If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the player that is `r` positions behind each player in `ans` to `temp`.

7. After processing each throw, it updates `ans` with the players in `temp`.

8. Finally, it prints the number of players in `ans` and the players themselves in sorted order.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases, including when the direction is unknown ('?'). It also correctly handles the case when a player is at position 0, which is equivalent to position `n`.

Correctness: **True**
