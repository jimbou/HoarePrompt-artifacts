Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the result of func_1() for each iteration of the loop, excluding 0 and including n.**

The code snippet modifies the set `ans` by removing the value 0 and adding the value `n`. The initial state of `ans` includes all possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n`, where `ri` is the result of `func_1()` for each iteration of the loop, and it includes 0. After the code executes, `ans` no longer contains 0 and now includes `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
