This function generates and returns all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the result of func_1() for each iteration of the loop, given a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, and a positive integer x such that 1 <= x <= n. It then prints the number of unique possible values and the unique values in ascending order, excluding 0 and including n if 0 is present.
