Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the result of func_1() for each iteration of the loop. If 0 is in ans, then 0 is excluded from ans and n is included in ans. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.**
