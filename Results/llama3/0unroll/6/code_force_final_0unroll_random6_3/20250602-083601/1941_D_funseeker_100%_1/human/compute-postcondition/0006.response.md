The code prints the number of elements in the set `ans`, which contains all possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n`, where `ri` is the result of `func_1()` for each iteration of the loop. If 0 is in `ans`, then 0 is excluded from `ans` and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and the results of `func_1()` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of unique possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n` after the exclusion of 0 and inclusion of `n` if necessary.

Output: **the number of unique possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n after the exclusion of 0 and inclusion of n if necessary**
