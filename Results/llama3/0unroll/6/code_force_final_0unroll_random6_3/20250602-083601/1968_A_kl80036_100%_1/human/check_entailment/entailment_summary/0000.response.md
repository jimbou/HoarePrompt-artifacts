Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The provided program simply subtracts 1 from each input integer x and prints the result as y.

The key observation here is that when y = x - 1, gcd(x, y) is always 1, because x and x - 1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. As a result, gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x, which is indeed the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y.

Therefore, the program's approach of simply subtracting 1 from each input integer x is a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
