#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: stdin contains no inputs, and the console contains t lines each containing an integer y (1 ≤ y ≤ 999).

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a series of integers from standard input, subtracts 1 from each integer, and prints the resulting values to the console.
