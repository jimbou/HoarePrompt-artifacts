Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply sets y to x - 1 and prints it.

The key observation here is that gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. So, gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x.

Since x is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y, setting y to x - 1 indeed maximizes the expression. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
