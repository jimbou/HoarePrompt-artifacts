Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: score is the sum of the first k elements of a plus the sum of the elements of a at the positions specified by the cycle times the number of full cycles, current_pos is the kth element of p, steps is k, visited is a dictionary with keys from 1 to k and values from 0 to k-1, start_pos is unchanged, k is unchanged, p is unchanged, a is unchanged, cycle_start is unchanged, cycle_length is steps - cycle_start, cycle_score is the sum of the elements of a at the positions specified by the cycle, cycle_pos is the position after the last element of the cycle, remaining_steps is 0, full_cycles is the number of full cycles, remainder_steps is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
