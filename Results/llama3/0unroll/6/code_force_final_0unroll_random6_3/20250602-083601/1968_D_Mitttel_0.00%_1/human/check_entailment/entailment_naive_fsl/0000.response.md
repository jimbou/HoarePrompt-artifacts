Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function determines the winner of the game by calculating the scores of both players using the `calculate_score` function. The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the case where the player's position forms a cycle, and it also handles the case where the number of steps is less than the cycle length.

The program also correctly handles the input and output operations. The `func_2` function reads the input data, calls the `func_1` function for each test case, and prints the results.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
