Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on their scores, which are calculated by traversing a permutation (p) and accumulating values from a list (a) for a specified number of steps (k). The program correctly handles cycles in the permutation by adding the score of the cycle and remaining steps.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, calculate_score, and func_2. func_1 determines the winner of the game based on the scores calculated by calculate_score. calculate_score calculates the score by traversing the permutation and accumulating values from the list, handling cycles in the permutation. func_2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic of the game, and the functions work together to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
