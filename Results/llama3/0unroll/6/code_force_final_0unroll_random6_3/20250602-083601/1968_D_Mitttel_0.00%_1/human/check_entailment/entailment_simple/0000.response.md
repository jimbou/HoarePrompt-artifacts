Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The program uses a function `calculate_score` to calculate the score for a given starting position, and then compares the scores of two players to determine the winner.

The function `calculate_score` uses a while loop to iterate through the permutation, keeping track of the current position and the score. If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the score for the cycle and adds it to the total score.

The main function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program also includes a function `func_3` that reads input from the standard input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
