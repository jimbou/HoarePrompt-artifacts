Postcondition: ***The score is the sum of the first k elements of a, current_pos is the kth element of p, steps is k, visited is a dictionary with keys from 1 to k and values from 0 to k-1, cycle_start is -1, start_pos is unchanged, k is unchanged, p is unchanged, and a is unchanged. If cycle_start is not -1, the score is increased by the sum of the elements of a at the positions specified by the remaining steps, the current position is updated to the position after the last element of the remaining steps, and the remaining steps are reduced to 0.***
