Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: data is an empty list, index is 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, t is a non-negative integer, n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, PB and PS are non-negative integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, p is a list of non-negative integers of length n, a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, results is a list of length t containing the results of func_1 for each iteration, sys.stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
