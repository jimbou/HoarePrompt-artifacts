Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores, which are calculated by traversing a permutation and accumulating values from a list for a specified number of steps, handling cycles in the permutation.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha, which are calculated by `func_2`. `func_2` calculates the score by traversing a permutation and accumulating values from a list for a specified number of steps, handling cycles in the permutation. `func_3` reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the input and output, and the logic is correct. The program also handles the case where the number of steps is greater than the length of the permutation, and it correctly calculates the score in this case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
