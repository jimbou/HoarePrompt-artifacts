Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings representing integers or space-separated lists of integers. The function iterates over the input data, extracting parameters such as the number of test cases (t), the size of the input arrays (n), and other integers (k, PB, PS). It then calls another function (func_1) with these parameters and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function modifies the input data by consuming it and updates the results list with the output of func_1 for each iteration.**
