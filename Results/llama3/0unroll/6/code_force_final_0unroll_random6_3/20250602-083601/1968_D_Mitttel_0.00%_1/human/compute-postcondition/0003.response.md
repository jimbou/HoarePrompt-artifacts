Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the contents of the results list have been printed to the console, and the loop has finished executing. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated as follows: result has taken on the value of each element in the results list in turn, and the print function has been called for each element in the results list. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
