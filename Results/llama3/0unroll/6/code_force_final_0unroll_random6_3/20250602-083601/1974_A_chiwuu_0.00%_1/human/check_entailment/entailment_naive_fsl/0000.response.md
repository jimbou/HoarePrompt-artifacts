Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It first calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, and then checks if there is enough space left for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where there are no 1x1 or 2x2 icons, or where the number of 1x1 icons is a multiple of 15. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of 2x2 icons is not a multiple of 5, by rounding up to the nearest multiple of 5.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly solved by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
