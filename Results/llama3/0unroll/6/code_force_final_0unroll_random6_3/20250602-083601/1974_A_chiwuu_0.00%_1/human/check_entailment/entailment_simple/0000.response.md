Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It first calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, taking into account that each screen can hold 4 2x2 icons. It then calculates the remaining space on those screens that can be used for 1x1 icons. If there are still 1x1 icons left, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate them. The program correctly handles the cases where the number of 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, and where the number of 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining space.

Correctness: **True**
