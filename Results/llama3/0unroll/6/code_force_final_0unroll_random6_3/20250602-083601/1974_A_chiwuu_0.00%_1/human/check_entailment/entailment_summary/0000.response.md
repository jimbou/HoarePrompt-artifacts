Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop is represented as a grid of size 5x3, and there are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program works by first calculating the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2, dividing the result by 5, and rounding up to the nearest integer. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells on the screen, and each screen has 15 cells.

Next, the program calculates the number of cells remaining on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons by 15, subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons, and storing the result in the variable t1.

If the number of 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the number of remaining cells, the program prints the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by subtracting the number of remaining cells from the number of 1x1 icons, dividing the result by 15, and rounding up to the nearest integer. It then adds this result to the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons and prints the total.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. However, the program can be improved for readability and maintainability by using more descriptive variable names and adding comments to explain the logic.

Correctness: **True**
