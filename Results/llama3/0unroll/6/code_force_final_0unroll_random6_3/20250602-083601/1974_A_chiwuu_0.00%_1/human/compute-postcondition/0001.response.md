Output State: **The loop will print n lines, each containing an integer. The integer on each line represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the given pair of integers (x, y) into a pair (a, b) such that a >= b * 4 and a <= b * 15. The value of n and the input pairs (x, y) remain unchanged.**
