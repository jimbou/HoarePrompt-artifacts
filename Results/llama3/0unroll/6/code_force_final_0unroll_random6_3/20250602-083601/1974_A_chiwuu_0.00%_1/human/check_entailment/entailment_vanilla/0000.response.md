Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of screens with a grid size of 5x3, and there are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).

The program then calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), dividing the result by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows), and rounding up to the nearest integer if necessary. This gives the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons.

Next, the program calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons), and storing the result in the variable t1.

The program then checks if the remaining space (t1) is sufficient to place the 1x1 icons. If it is, the program uses the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons as the minimum number of screens needed. If not, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by subtracting the remaining space (t1) from the number of 1x1 icons, dividing the result by 15, and rounding up to the nearest integer if necessary. The program then adds this additional number of screens to the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons to get the minimum number of screens needed.

Finally, the program prints the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
