Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be formed by performing the given operations on the input array `a`.

The program works by first adding the index `i` to each element `a_i` in the array `a`. It then removes duplicates by converting the array to a set and sorts the remaining elements in descending order. The program then iterates over the sorted array, and for each element, it checks if there are any available elements that can be inserted before it to form a larger lexicographically sorted array. If there are available elements, it inserts them before the current element. Finally, the program appends any remaining available elements to the end of the array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the input array `a` contains duplicate elements. The use of a `Counter` object to keep track of the count of each element in the array ensures that the program correctly handles cases where an element is inserted multiple times.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
