Output State: **The list 'a' contains unique integers in descending order, 'counter' contains the frequency of each integer in the original list 'a', 'cnt' is the number of duplicate integers in the original list 'a', and 'ans' is an empty list, and n remains unchanged.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the list 'a' is modified to contain unique integers in descending order. The 'counter' variable contains the frequency of each integer in the original list 'a'. The 'cnt' variable is calculated as the difference between the original length of 'a' (which is n) and the new length of 'a' after removing duplicates, representing the number of duplicate integers in the original list 'a'. The 'ans' variable is an empty list. The value of 'n' remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
