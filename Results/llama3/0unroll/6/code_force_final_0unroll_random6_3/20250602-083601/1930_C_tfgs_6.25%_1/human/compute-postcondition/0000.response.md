Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the first line of the current test case in stdin. The value of `a` is a list of `n` integers that were read from the second line of the current test case in stdin. Stdin now contains one less test case than it did initially.
