This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It increments each integer by its 1-based index, removes duplicates, and sorts the list in descending order. Then, it reconstructs the original list by inserting missing integers between each pair of adjacent integers. Finally, it prints the reconstructed list, which includes all original integers and the missing integers between each pair of adjacent integers.
