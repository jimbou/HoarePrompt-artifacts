#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        
    #State: The loop will print 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case, depending on whether the favorite element is among the k most frequent elements in the list. The output will be a series of these strings, one for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, f, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then determines whether a favorite element (specified by f) is among the k most frequent elements in the list. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the favorite element is among the k most frequent, 'NO' if it is not, or 'MAYBE' if it is among the k most frequent but its frequency is not sufficient to guarantee this. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding output for each case.
