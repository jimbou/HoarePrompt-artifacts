Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the favorite cube's value is the same as the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting. In this case, the program should output "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed, depending on its position in the sorted list. However, the program does not check for this case and will output "YES" or "NO" incorrectly.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but it should output "MAYBE" because the favorite cube's value (3) is the same as the value of the cube at the 2nd position after sorting (3), and it may or may not be removed.

To fix this issue, the program should add an additional check to handle this case.
