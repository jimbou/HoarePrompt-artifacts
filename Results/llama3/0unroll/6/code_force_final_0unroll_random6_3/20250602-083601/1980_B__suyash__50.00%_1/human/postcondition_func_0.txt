This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, f, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then determines whether a favorite element (specified by f) is among the k most frequent elements in the list. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the favorite element is among the k most frequent, 'NO' if it is not, or 'MAYBE' if it is among the k most frequent but its frequency is not sufficient to guarantee this. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding output for each case.
