Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It checks for two cases: when (n + x - 2) is even and when (n - x) is even. For each case, it finds the divisors of the corresponding number and checks if the divisor plus 2 is even and greater than or equal to x. If so, it adds the divisor plus 2 to the output list. Finally, it removes duplicates from the output list and prints its length.

The program correctly handles the constraints that k > 1 and that the settling exists if and only if k > 1. It also correctly handles the case when x is 1, as shown in the example input and output.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
