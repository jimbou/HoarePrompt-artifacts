Output State: **output1 is a list of divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x in reverse order, output2 is a list of divisors of x that are greater than the square root of x, x is unchanged.**

In this output state, the list output1 has been reversed, meaning that the order of its elements has been reversed. The list output2 and the variable x remain unchanged.
