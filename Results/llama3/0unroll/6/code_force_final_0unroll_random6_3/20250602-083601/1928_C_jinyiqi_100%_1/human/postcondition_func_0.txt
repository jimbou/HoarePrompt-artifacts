This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a combined list of divisors of the input integers, where the first part of the list contains divisors greater than the square root of the input integers, and the second part contains divisors less than or equal to the square root of the input integers in reverse order. The input list remains unchanged.
