Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program takes two integers as input, n and x, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even numbers. If they are, it calls the function func_1 to find the divisors of these numbers. The function func_1 returns a list of divisors in a specific order, where the first part of the list contains divisors greater than the square root of the number, and the second part contains divisors less than or equal to the square root of the number in reverse order.

The program then checks each divisor to see if it meets the condition (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x. If a divisor meets this condition, it is added to the output list.

Finally, the program removes duplicates from the output list and prints the length of the list, which represents the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly checks for the conditions specified in the problem and calculates the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
