Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of natural numbers k that fit under the given constraints. The constraints are based on the settling of people in a line, where the first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., k, the next k-2 people have numbers k-1, k-2, ..., 2, and so on.

The program takes two inputs, n and x, which represent Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively. It then calculates the possible values of k that satisfy the given constraints.

The program uses a helper function, func_1, to find all the divisors of a given number. This function is used to find the divisors of (n + x - 2) and (n - x), which are used to calculate the possible values of k.

The program then checks if the calculated values of k satisfy the constraints (k > 1, (s + 2) % 2 == 0, and (s + 2) / 2 >= x). If they do, the values are added to the output list.

Finally, the program removes duplicates from the output list by converting it to a set and then prints the length of the output list, which represents the number of different k that fit under the given constraints.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
