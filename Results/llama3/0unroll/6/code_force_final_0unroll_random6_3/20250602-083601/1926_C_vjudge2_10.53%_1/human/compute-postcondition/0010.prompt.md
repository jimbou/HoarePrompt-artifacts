You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4) and then a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5).
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 10 integers where the value at index i is i, sum_values is a list of 10 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 55.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 55.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
