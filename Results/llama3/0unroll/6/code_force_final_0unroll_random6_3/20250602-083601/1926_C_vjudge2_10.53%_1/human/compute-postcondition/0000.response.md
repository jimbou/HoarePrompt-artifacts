The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since the input is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `t` becomes an integer within this range. The second line initializes an empty list `numbers`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
