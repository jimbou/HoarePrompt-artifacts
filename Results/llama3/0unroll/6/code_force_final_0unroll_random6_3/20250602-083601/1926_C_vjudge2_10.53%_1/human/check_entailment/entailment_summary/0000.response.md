Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum of digits for each integer and the cumulative sum of these sums.

The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits and cumulative sum of these sums, respectively. It then iterates over the input integers, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists accordingly.

The program uses a clever approach to calculate the sum of digits for each integer. It converts the integer to a string, extracts the last digit, and calculates the sum of digits for the remaining part of the integer. This approach avoids the need to iterate over each digit of the integer, making the program more efficient.

The program also uses a cumulative sum approach to calculate the sum of sums for each integer. This approach allows the program to avoid recalculating the sum of sums for each integer, making the program more efficient.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and prints the cumulative sum of these sums for each integer.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
