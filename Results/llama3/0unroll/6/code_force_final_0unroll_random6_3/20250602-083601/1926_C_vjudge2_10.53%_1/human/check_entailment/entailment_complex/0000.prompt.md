Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4) and then a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5).
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]

        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 10 integers where the value at index i is i, sum_values is a list of 10 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 55.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: t is 0, numbers is a list of t integers, values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the value at index i is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 55.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and prints the cumulative sum of these sums for each integer. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly to the console. The input integers are expected to be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The function initializes two lists, values and sum_values, to store the sum of digits and cumulative sum of these sums, respectively. It then iterates over the input integers, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and updates the values and sum_values lists accordingly. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum of sums for each integer.
