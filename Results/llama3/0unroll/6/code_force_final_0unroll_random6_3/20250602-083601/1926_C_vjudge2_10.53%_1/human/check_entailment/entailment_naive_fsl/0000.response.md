Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after replacement. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to store the sum of the numbers from 1 to i, but it does not correctly handle the case when the input number n is greater than the maximum value in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays.

For example, if the input is 200001, the program will throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" error because it tries to access `values[200001]` and `sum_values[200001]`, which are not defined.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacement for each input number n separately, without relying on precomputed values. Alternatively, the program could use a more efficient algorithm that does not require storing the sum of the numbers from 1 to i for all i up to n.
