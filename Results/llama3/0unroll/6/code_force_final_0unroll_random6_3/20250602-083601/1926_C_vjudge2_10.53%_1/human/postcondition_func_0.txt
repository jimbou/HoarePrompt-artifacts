This function reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and prints the cumulative sum of these sums for each integer. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly to the console. The input integers are expected to be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The function initializes two lists, values and sum_values, to store the sum of digits and cumulative sum of these sums, respectively. It then iterates over the input integers, calculates the sum of digits for each integer, and updates the values and sum_values lists accordingly. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum of sums for each integer.
