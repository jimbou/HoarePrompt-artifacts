Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program works by first initializing an array p of size n with all elements set to 0. Then, it fills the array p by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers, starting from the largest.

The outer loop iterates over the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation n. It then initializes the array p and fills it according to the described strategy.

The key insight behind this strategy is that by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers, we can ensure that there are no two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. This is because the largest integer will always be placed at an even index, and the smallest integer will always be placed at an odd index. As a result, the divisibility condition will never be satisfied.

The program correctly implements this strategy and produces the desired output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
