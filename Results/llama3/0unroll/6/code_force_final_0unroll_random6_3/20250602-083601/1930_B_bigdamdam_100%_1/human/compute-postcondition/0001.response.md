Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer representing the length of a permutation. It then generates a permutation of integers from 1 to the given length, constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers, starting from the largest. The function prints each generated permutation on a separate line, resulting in multiple lines of output.**
