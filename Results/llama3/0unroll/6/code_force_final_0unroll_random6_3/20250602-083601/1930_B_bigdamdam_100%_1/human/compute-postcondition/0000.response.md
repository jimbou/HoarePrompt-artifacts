Output State: **The output state contains multiple lines of output. Each line contains a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the permutation. The permutation is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers, starting from the largest. The first line contains the permutation for the first test case, the second line contains the permutation for the second test case, and so on.**
