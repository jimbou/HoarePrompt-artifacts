Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program works by generating a permutation of integers from 1 to n, constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers, starting from the largest. This approach ensures that no two consecutive integers in the permutation divide each other, satisfying the problem's condition.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the length of the permutation for each test case and generating the corresponding permutation. The output is also correctly formatted, with each permutation printed on a separate line.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
