Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. 

When k equals n, the output sequence consists of 1s of length n, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this sequence are sorted.

When k equals 1, the output sequence consists of integers from 0 to n-1, which is a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of this sequence is sorted (the original sequence itself).

For all other cases, the output sequence is a single -1, which is correct because there is no valid array a that satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
