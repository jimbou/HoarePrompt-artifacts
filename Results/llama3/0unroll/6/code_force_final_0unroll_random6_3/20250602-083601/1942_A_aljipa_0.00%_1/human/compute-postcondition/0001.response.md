Output State: **The output will be a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. For each input line, if k equals n, the output will be a sequence of 1s of length n. If k equals 1, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1. For all other cases, the output will be a single -1. The number of output lines will be equal to the initial value of t.**
