Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   If `k` equals `n`, the program outputs a sequence of 1s of length `n`. This is correct because a sequence of identical numbers is sorted, and all cyclic shifts of such a sequence are also sorted.
*   If `k` equals 1, the program outputs a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because only one cyclic shift of this sequence is sorted (the original sequence itself), and all other cyclic shifts are not sorted.
*   For all other cases (i.e., `k` is neither 1 nor `n`), the program outputs -1. This is correct because it is impossible to construct a sequence of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is neither 1 nor `n`. The reason is that if a sequence has more than one sorted cyclic shift, it must be a sequence of identical numbers (which would have `n` sorted cyclic shifts), or it must be a sequence that is not sorted at all (which would have 0 sorted cyclic shifts).

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
