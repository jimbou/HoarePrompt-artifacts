Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines, each containing two integers n and k, and generates a corresponding output sequence for each line. If k equals n, the output sequence consists of 1s of length n. If k equals 1, the output sequence consists of integers from 0 to n-1. For all other cases, the output sequence is a single -1. The function prints these output sequences, with the number of output lines equal to the initial input value t.**
