Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = n-1. In this case, the program will output [-1], which is incorrect. The correct output should be an array of length n that has exactly n-1 sorted cyclic shifts.

For example, when n = 4 and k = 3, the program will output [-1], but a correct output could be [1, 1, 1, 2], which has exactly 3 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 1], and [1, 2, 1, 1].
