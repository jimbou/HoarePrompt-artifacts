Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. When k equals n, it generates a sequence of 1s of length n, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. When k equals 1, it generates a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
3. For all other cases, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of list comprehensions and conditional expressions makes the code concise and readable.

Correctness: **True**
