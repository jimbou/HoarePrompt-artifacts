The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**
