Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes two inputs, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

The program first checks if k is equal to n. If it is, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted, which is only possible if all elements of the array are the same. Therefore, the program outputs an array of n ones.

If k is not equal to n, the program checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it means that only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by having an array with elements in increasing order, except for the last element which is smaller than the first element. Therefore, the program outputs an array of numbers from 1 to n.

If k is neither equal to n nor 1, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is correct and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
