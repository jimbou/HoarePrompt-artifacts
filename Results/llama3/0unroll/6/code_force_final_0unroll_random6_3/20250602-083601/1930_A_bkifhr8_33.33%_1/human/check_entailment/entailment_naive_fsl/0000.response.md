Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list `lst`. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. 

The expression `0 * 2` always evaluates to 0, so the program is always removing the first element of the list twice. This is not the intended behavior, as the program should remove the two smallest elements from the list in each iteration.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the list and then removing the two smallest elements in each iteration. Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            ans += min(lst[0], lst[1])
            lst = lst[2:]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected code sorts the list `lst` in ascending order and then removes the two smallest elements in each iteration, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
