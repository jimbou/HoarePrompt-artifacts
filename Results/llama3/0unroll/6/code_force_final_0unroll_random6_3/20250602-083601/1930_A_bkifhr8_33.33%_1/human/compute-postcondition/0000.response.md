Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 5000, `t` becomes an integer in this range. The second line initializes an empty list `ans_f`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`.
