Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. It then counts the number of duplicate integers in each test case and prints the result. The function assumes that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence at most twice and that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
