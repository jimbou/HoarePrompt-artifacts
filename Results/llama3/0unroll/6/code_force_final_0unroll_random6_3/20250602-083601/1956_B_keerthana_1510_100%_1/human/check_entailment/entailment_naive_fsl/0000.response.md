Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. It reads the input from the standard input, where each test case is represented by two lines: the first line contains the number of cards, and the second line contains the integers on the cards in the player's hand.

The program uses the fact that the maximum number of points that can be scored is equal to the number of pairs of identical integers in the player's hand. It achieves this by splitting the input line into tokens (using the `split()` method), converting the tokens to a set (using the `{*tokens}` syntax), and then subtracting the size of the set from the total number of tokens. The size of the set represents the number of unique integers in the player's hand, and the difference between the total number of tokens and the size of the set represents the number of pairs of identical integers.

The program uses a clever trick to calculate the number of pairs of identical integers. By subtracting the size of the set from the total number of tokens, it effectively counts the number of duplicate integers in the player's hand. This is because the set only contains unique integers, so any duplicates in the original list are not included in the set. By subtracting the size of the set from the total number of tokens, the program effectively counts the number of duplicates, which represents the number of pairs of identical integers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player, and it does so in a concise and efficient manner.
