Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. This matches the problem description, which states that the input contains multiple test cases, each with two lines.

2. The program then counts the number of duplicate integers in each test case by splitting the second line of each test case into tokens (i.e., the integers), converting the list of tokens to a set (which removes duplicates), and subtracting the length of the set from the length of the list of tokens. This gives the number of duplicate integers in each test case.

3. The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem description, which asks for the maximum number of points that can be scored in each test case.

4. The program assumes that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence at most twice, which is guaranteed by the problem description. It also assumes that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, which is also guaranteed by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
