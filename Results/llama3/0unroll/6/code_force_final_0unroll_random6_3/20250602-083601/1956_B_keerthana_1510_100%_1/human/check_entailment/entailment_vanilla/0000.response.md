Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the objective is to maximize the score by selecting cards that will result in points.

The provided Python program uses a clever approach to solve this problem. It reads the input from standard input (sys.stdin), skipping the first two lines of each test case, which contain the number of test cases and the number of cards, respectively. It then processes the remaining lines, which contain the cards in the player's hand.

The program uses a list comprehension to split each line into tokens (cards) and stores them in the `tokens` variable. It then uses the `len` function to count the number of tokens (cards) and subtracts the number of unique tokens (cards) obtained using the `set` data structure (`{*tokens}`). This effectively gives the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the player can score points only by selecting cards that have a duplicate in their hand. By counting the number of duplicate cards, the program determines the maximum number of points the player can score.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem using a concise and readable code.

Correctness: **True**
