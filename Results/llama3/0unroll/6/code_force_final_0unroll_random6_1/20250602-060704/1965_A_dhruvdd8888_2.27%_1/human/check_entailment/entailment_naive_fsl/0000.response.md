Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of numbers with more than two distinct values. The current implementation only checks if the difference between the smallest and the largest number is 1, and if it is, it assumes that all numbers in between are also present. However, this is not necessarily true.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 5, 7], the program will incorrectly assume that the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are also present, and will therefore incorrectly determine the winner.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle cases where there are more than two distinct values in the input. One possible solution is to use a different approach, such as using the XOR operation to determine the winner.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    xor = 0
    for num in nums:
        xor ^= num
    if xor == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```
This implementation uses the XOR operation to calculate the parity of the sum of the numbers in the input. If the parity is 0, then Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins. This approach correctly handles cases where there are more than two distinct values in the input.
