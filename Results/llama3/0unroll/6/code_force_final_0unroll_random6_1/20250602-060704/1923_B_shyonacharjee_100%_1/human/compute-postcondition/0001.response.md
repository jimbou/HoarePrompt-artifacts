Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each indicating whether the player can survive the monsters in the corresponding test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed is equal to the initial value of `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are unchanged, but the loop variables `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` are reset for each test case.**
