#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n, x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each indicating whether the player can survive the monsters in the corresponding test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed is equal to the initial value of `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are unchanged, but the loop variables `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` are reset for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results to the console. It takes no arguments and returns no values. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and k), a list of n integers (a), and another list of n integers (x). It then determines whether a player can survive a series of monsters based on their positions and health, given the player's bullet capacity (k). The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive all monsters and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases (t) and does not modify the input values.
