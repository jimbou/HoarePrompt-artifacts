Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the first and last elements of the array are equal, and if so, it calculates the length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing the minimum number of elements. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible cases.

For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. The program will incorrectly calculate the length of the subarray as 4, when in fact the correct answer is 5 (by removing the first and last elements).

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal. This can be done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to the current element.

Correctness: **False**
