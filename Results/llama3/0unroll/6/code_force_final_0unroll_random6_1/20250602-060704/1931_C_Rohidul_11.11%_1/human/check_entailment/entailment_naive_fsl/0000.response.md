Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the cases where the first and last elements of the array are the same or different. The program only checks if the first and last elements are the same, and if they are, it calculates the answer as `r - l - 1`. However, this is not correct because it does not consider the case where the first and last elements are the same, but there are other elements in between that are different.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 1]`. The program will calculate the answer as `1 - 1 - 1 = -1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because we need to change the middle two elements to make all elements equal.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the first and last elements are different. The program checks if `st == 0 and end == 0 and (a[0] != a[-1])`, and if this condition is true, it sets the answer to `len(a) - 1`. However, this is not correct because it does not consider the case where there are other elements in the array that are the same as the first or last element.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]`. The program will set the answer to `6`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `5` because we can change the last element to make all elements equal.

Overall, the program does not correctly solve the problem and needs to be revised to handle all possible cases.
