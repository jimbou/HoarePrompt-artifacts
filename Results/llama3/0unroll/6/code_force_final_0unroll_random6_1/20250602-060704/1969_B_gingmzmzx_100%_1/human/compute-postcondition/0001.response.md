Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer, and the stdin is empty since all the inputs have been read and processed. The loop has printed `n` lines of output, each containing a single integer value representing the count of operations required to make all the bits in the input binary string equal. The values of other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.**
