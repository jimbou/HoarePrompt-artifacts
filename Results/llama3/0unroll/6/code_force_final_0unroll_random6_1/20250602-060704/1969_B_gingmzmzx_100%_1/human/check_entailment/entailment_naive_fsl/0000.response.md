Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The program works by counting the number of zeroes in the string and then iterating through the string, keeping track of the count of zeroes and ones. For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted by either adding the count of ones to the cost if the character is zero, or adding the remaining count of zeroes to the cost if the character is one. The program then prints the total cost.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the string is already sorted, where the string contains only zeroes or only ones, and where the string contains a mix of zeroes and ones. The program also handles the case where the string has a length of 2, which is a special case mentioned in the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
