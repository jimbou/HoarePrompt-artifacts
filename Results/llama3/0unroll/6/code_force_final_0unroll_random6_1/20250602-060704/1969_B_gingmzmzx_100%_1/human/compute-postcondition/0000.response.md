Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a binary string (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer that was input first, and the stdin now contains only one input, which is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
