This function reads a positive integer `n` from standard input, followed by `n` binary strings. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all bits equal. The function does not modify the input values or the state of the program, except for consuming the input and printing the results. The output consists of `n` lines, each containing a single integer representing the count of operations required for the corresponding binary string.
