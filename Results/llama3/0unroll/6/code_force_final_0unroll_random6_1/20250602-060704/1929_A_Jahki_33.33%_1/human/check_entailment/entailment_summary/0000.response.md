Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already in strictly increasing order, it prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The `func_1` function checks if the array is strictly increasing, but the program prints 0 as the maximum beauty if the array is already in strictly increasing order. This is incorrect because the maximum beauty of an array in strictly increasing order is not necessarily 0. The correct approach is to calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, regardless of whether the original array was in strictly increasing order or not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
