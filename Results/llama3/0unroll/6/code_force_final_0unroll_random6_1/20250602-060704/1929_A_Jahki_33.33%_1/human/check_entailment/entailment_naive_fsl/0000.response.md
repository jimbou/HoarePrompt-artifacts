Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. However, this function is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input array is `[3, 2, 1]`, the `func_1` function will return `True` because the array is sorted in descending order. However, the program will then print `0` as the maximum beauty, which is incorrect. The correct maximum beauty for this array is `2`, which can be achieved by rearranging the elements to `[1, 2, 3]`.

The program should simply sort the array in ascending order and calculate the maximum beauty without using the `func_1` function. Here is the corrected code:

```
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected code will work correctly for all potential cases.
