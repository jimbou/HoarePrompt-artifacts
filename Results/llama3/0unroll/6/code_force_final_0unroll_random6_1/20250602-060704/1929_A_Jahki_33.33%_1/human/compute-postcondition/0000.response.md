Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100 and `num2` is the length of the list `a`, `order` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been initialized to 0. The values of `a` and `num2` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `num2` and the length of `a` is still valid.
