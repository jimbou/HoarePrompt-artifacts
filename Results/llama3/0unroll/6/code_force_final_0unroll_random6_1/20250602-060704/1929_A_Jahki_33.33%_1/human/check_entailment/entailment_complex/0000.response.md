Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the input list is already in a strictly increasing order. If it is, the program prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the input list is strictly increasing by iterating through the list and counting the number of pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. If no such pairs are found, the function returns True, indicating that the list is strictly increasing.

The main program uses the `func_1` function to determine whether to print 0 or calculate the maximum beauty. If the list is strictly increasing, the maximum beauty is 0. Otherwise, the program sorts the list and calculates the maximum beauty.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
