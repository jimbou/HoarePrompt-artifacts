#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, num2 is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100 and num2 is the length of the list a.
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100 and `num2` is the length of the list `a`, `order` is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that there are no pairs of adjacent elements in list 'a' where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, and the length of list 'a' is between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of integers is strictly increasing, meaning that each element is greater than the previous one, and returns True if the list meets this condition and False otherwise. The function assumes that the input list has a length between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
