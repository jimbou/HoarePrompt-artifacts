Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`num`) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the elements of the array (`a`).
3. The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. If the array is sorted, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
4. If the array is already sorted (i.e., `func_1` returns `True`), the program prints `0` as the maximum beauty, because no rearrangement is needed.
5. If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function and stores the result in `b`.
6. The program then calculates the maximum beauty by iterating over the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
7. Finally, the program prints the maximum beauty for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a minor issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, and the program can be simplified by removing it. The program can directly sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty without checking if the array is already sorted.

Correctness: **True**
