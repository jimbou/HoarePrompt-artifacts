Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the function `func_1`. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order by iterating over the array and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, it increments a counter `order`. If the counter `order` is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means that the array is already sorted in ascending order, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
