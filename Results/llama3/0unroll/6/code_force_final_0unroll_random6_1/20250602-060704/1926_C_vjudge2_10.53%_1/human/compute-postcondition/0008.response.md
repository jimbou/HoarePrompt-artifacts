Output State: The loop iterates over the list of numbers and prints the sum of the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the printed output. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have not changed, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.
