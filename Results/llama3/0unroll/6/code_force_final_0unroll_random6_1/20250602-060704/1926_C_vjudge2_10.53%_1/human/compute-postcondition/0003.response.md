Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, numbers is a list of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5) of length t, values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 with all elements equal to 0, sum_values is a list of integers of length max(numbers) + 1 with all elements equal to 0, total is an integer equal to 0, stdin contains no input.**

The code initializes three lists: `values`, `sum_values`, and a variable `total`. The length of `values` and `sum_values` is determined by the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. All elements in `values` and `sum_values` are initialized to 0. The variable `total` is also initialized to 0. The initial state of `t` and `numbers` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. Stdin remains empty as there are no input operations in the code.
