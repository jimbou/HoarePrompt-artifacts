This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers, and prints the results to the console. The values of the numbers are calculated based on the sum of the values of the last digit and the remaining digits of the number. The function handles a list of integers of length up to 10^4, where each integer is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5.
