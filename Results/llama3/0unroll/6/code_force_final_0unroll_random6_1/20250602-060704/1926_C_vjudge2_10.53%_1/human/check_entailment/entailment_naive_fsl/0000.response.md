Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to store the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, but it does not handle the case when n is greater than the maximum value in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays.

For example, if the input is `n = 200001`, the program will throw an `IndexError` because it tries to access `values[200001]` and `sum_values[200001]`, which are out of range.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case when n is greater than the maximum value in the `values` and `sum_values` arrays. One possible solution is to increase the size of these arrays to accommodate larger values of n.

Alternatively, the program can use a different approach to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board, such as using a mathematical formula to calculate the sum directly without storing the intermediate results in arrays.
