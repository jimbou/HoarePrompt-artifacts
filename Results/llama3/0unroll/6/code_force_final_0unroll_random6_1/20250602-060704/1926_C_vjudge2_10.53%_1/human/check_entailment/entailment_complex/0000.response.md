Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers, and prints the results to the console.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers. It first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers, respectively. It then calculates the values of each number from 1 to `n` (the maximum number in the input) and stores them in the `values` list. The `sum_values` list is then calculated by adding the value of each number to the sum of the values of the previous numbers.

The program then reads a sequence of integers from standard input and prints the sum of the values of each number and the sum of the values of the previous numbers for each number in the sequence.

The program handles a list of integers of length up to 10^4, where each integer is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the maximum number in the input, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
