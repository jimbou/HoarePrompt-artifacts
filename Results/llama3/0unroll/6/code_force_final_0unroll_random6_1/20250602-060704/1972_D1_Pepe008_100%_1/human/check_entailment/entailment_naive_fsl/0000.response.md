Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x` and the additional condition for incrementing `suma`. The program does not correctly handle the case when `a` is a multiple of `i**2` and `i*(i-1)` is a multiple of `i**2`.

A counterexample is when `a = 4` and `b = 2`. The correct output should be 4, but the program outputs 3. The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (4, 2) satisfy the conditions, but the program misses the pair (4, 2).

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if the conditions are satisfied. The program's current approach is incorrect and does not cover all possible cases.
