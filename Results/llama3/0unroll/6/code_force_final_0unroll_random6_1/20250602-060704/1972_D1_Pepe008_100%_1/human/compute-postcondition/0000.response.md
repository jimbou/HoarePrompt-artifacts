The code reads the first line from the standard input, which contains the number of test cases `t`, and converts it to an integer using `int(input())`. This value is then assigned to the variable `T`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), with `T-1` test cases remaining**
