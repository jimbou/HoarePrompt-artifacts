Output State: The loop will execute T times, and for each execution, it will read two positive integers n and m from the standard input. The loop will calculate the value of suma based on the given formula and print the result of suma - 2. After all T iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The state of the variables T, n, and m will remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
