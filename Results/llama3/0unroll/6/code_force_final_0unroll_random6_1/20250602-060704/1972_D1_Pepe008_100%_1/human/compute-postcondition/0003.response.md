Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates a value 'suma' based on a given formula and prints the result of 'suma - 2'. The function executes this process T times, where T is the number of test cases provided in the input, and then terminates without modifying the input values.**
