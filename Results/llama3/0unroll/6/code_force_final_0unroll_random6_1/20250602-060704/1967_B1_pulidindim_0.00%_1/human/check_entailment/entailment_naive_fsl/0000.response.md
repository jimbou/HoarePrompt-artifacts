Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers the case where `a+b` is a multiple of `b*gcd(a,b)` when `a` is a multiple of `count` (i.e., `a = count*k` for some integer `k`). However, this is not the only case where the condition is satisfied.

A counterexample is when `n = 5` and `m = 3`. The program will output `6`, but the correct answer is `7`. The pair `(5, 3)` is not counted by the program, but it satisfies the condition since `5+3 = 8` is a multiple of `3*gcd(5,3) = 3`.

The program's logic is incomplete, and it does not consider all possible cases where the condition `a+b` is a multiple of `b*gcd(a,b)` is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
