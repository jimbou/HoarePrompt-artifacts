This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving n and m for each test case. The function iteratively updates the result based on a conditional logic involving the values of n, m, and a counter variable. Once all test cases have been processed, the function concludes, leaving the input variables updated to their last test case values.
