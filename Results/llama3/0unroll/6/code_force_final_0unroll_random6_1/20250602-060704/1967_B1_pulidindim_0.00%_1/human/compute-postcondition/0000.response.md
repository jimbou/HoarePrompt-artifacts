The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, which is assigned to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`. Since `t` is assigned the first input, it is the number of test cases. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`**
