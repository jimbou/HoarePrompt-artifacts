Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is built by Alice picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`, while Bob picks elements from `a` and deletes them.

The provided program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates through the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to `N-1`) and checks if the count of the current MEX value is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of the current MEX value is 0, it prints the current MEX value as the final score.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If a MEX value has a count of 1, it means that Alice can pick that element and append it to `c`, making it part of the MEX. If there are two or more such elements, Alice can pick both of them, making the MEX at least 2.
* If a MEX value has a count of 0, it means that Bob can pick that element and delete it from `a`, making it not part of the MEX. In this case, the MEX is at least the current value.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
