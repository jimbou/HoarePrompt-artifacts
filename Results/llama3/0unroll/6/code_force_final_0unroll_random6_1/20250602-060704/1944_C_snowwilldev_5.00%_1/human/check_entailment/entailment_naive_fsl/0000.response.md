Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the game strategy for Alice and Bob. The key insight is that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program uses a frequency count `cnt` to keep track of the occurrences of each number in the input array `a`.

The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N-1` and checks if the count of each number is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes 2 or more, or if the count of a number is 0, the program prints the current number `i` and breaks the loop.

This strategy works because if a number has a count of 1, Alice can choose it to maximize her MEX. If a number has a count of 0, it means that Bob has already chosen it, and Alice cannot choose it. If `t` becomes 2 or more, it means that there are at least two numbers with a count of 1, and Alice can choose one of them to maximize her MEX.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
