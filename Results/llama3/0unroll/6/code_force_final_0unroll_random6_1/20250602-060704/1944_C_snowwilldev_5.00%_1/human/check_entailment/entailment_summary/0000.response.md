Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to N-1 and checks if the count of the current number is 1. If it is, it increments a counter t. If t is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of the current number is 0, it prints the current number and breaks the loop. This is because if a number appears more than once, Alice can pick it and Bob can't, so the MEX will be at least the current number. If a number appears exactly once, Alice can pick it and Bob can't, so the MEX will be at least the current number plus one. If a number doesn't appear at all, the MEX will be the current number.

Correctness: **True**
