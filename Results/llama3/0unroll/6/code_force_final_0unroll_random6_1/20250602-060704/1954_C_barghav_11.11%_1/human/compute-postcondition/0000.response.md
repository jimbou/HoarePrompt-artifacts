Output State: **a is a list of characters representing the first pair of integers from stdin, b is a list of characters representing the second pair of integers from stdin, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is a list of characters representing the first pair of integers from stdin, and the variable `b` is a list of characters representing the second pair of integers from stdin. The stdin now contains t-2 pairs of integers, as two pairs have been read and assigned to `a` and `b`.
