The function takes two pairs of integers from standard input, swaps the maximum and minimum values in the first half and second half of each pair, and prints the modified pairs. The first pair is printed with the maximum values in the first half and the minimum values in the second half, followed by the second pair printed in its entirety with the minimum values in the first half and the maximum values in the second half.
