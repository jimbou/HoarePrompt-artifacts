Based on the precondition, the list `a` contains the maximum values from the corresponding pairs of integers from stdin in the first half and the minimum values from the corresponding pairs of integers from stdin in the second half. On the other hand, the list `b` contains the minimum values from the corresponding pairs of integers from stdin in the first half and the maximum values from the corresponding pairs of integers from stdin in the second half.

Since the `print()` statement is empty, it will print nothing but a newline character.

Output: **a newline character**
