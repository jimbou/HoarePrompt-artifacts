Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem statement asks to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program correctly identifies that the robot can reach the cell (2, n) if the second-to-last character of the third input string (representing the second row of the grid) is not '<'. This is because if the second-to-last character is '<', the robot will be directed to the left and cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem, iterating over each test case and printing 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case independently and does not modify the input data.

Correctness: **True**
