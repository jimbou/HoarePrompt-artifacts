Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program correctly identifies that if the arrow in the second row, second last column (b[n - 2]) points to the left ('<'), the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). This is because the robot would move up and then follow the arrow to the left, getting stuck in an infinite loop.

If the arrow in the second row, second last column points to the right ('>'), the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving down and then following the arrow to the right.

The program correctly prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on this condition.

Correctness: **True**
