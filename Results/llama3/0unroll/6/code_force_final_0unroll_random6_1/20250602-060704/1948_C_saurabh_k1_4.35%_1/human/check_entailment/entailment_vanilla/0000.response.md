Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the second last cell in the second row is pointing to the left. If it is, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The program is only checking the second last cell in the second row, but it is not considering the entire path that the robot can take. The robot can move up, down, left, or right, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. Therefore, the program's approach is too simplistic and does not accurately solve the problem.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'Yes', but the correct answer is 'No'. This is because the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) by following the arrows.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
