Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It only checks if the arrow in the second last cell of the second row is pointing to the left, and if so, it prints 'No'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

For example, consider the case where n = 4, and the grid is:

>><<
>>><

In this case, the program will print 'Yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by exploring all possible paths. The given program does not do this and therefore is incorrect.
