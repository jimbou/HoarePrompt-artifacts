Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
2.  The program checks the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row (`b[n - 2]`). If this arrow points to the left (`<`), the program prints `No`, indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`. Otherwise, it prints `Yes`.
3.  The program's logic is based on the fact that the robot can only move right or down, and it must follow the arrow in the current cell after moving. Therefore, if the second-to-last arrow in the second row points to the left, the robot cannot reach the last column.
4.  The program processes each test case independently and does not modify the input data.

Correctness: **True**
