Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input.
2. The program initializes the variable `pergunta` to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum cost.
3. The program iterates over the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
4. For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is less than `m`. If it is, it updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum of the current value of `pergunta` and the sum of `x` (the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`) and `a[i]`.
5. The program updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.
6. After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of `pergunta`, which represents the minimum cost.

The program's logic is correct because it iterates over the lists in reverse order, which allows it to calculate the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` from the end to the current index. The update of `pergunta` is also correct, as it takes into account the minimum cost of reaching the current index.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
