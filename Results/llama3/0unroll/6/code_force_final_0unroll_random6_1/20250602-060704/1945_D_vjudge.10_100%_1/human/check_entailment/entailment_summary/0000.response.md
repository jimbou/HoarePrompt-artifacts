Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the first `m` positions in the queue. It iterates over the lists `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position. The variable `pergunta` is used to store the minimum cost to reach the first `m` positions. The program correctly handles the case where Kirill can choose to pay either `a_i` or `b_i` coins to move to a position.

Correctness: **True**
