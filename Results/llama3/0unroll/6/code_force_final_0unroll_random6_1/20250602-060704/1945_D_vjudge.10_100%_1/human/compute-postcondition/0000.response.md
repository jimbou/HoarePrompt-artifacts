Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is 0**

In this output state, all the initial conditions are still valid, and a new variable `x` has been introduced with a value of 0. The lists `a` and `b` still have the same length `n`, and the integers `n` and `m` still satisfy the given constraints. The variable `pergunta` remains an integer.
