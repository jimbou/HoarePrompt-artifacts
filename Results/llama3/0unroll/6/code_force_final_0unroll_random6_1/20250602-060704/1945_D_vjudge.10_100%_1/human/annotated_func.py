#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: the value of pergunta (which is an integer)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum value of the sum of the minimum of two lists of integers from the end to a specified index, and updates the value of a variable 'pergunta' accordingly. It then prints the updated value of 'pergunta'. The function takes no parameters and returns no value, but modifies the state of the program by printing the calculated value.
