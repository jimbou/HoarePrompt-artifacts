Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one line.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a map. The second line uses this function to read an integer `t` from stdin. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input, it becomes an integer. The stdin now contains a series of test cases minus one line, which was read by the `R` function.
