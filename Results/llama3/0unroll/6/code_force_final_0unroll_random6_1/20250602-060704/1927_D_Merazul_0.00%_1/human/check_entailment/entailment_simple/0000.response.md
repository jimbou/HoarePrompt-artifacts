Reasoning:

The given Python program is incorrect. The program is supposed to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses a series of bitwise operations and conditional statements to calculate the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`. However, these calculations do not correctly determine the existence of two different elements in the array `a` within the range `[l, r]`.

The program also uses a strange way of printing the result using the string `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`. This does not correctly output the indices `i` and `j` as required by the problem statement.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly handle the case where `l == r`, which is a valid input according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
