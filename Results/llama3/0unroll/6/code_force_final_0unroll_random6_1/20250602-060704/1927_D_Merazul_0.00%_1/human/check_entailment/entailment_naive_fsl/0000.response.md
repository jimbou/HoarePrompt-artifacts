Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses a set to store the elements of the array a, which loses the information about the indices of the elements. Then, it tries to find a pair of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r by checking if the elements are in the set a or not. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the indices of the elements.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program will output:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

Because the program does not correctly consider the indices of the elements, it produces incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
