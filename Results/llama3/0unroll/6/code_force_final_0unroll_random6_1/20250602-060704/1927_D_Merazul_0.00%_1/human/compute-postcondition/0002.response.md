Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a line of n space-separated integers, an integer q, and q lines of two space-separated integers. It then checks for each test case if a certain condition is met, based on the presence of integers in two sets, and prints a string ('Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S') to standard output indicating the result. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard output containing a series of result strings and the variable 't' set to 0.**
