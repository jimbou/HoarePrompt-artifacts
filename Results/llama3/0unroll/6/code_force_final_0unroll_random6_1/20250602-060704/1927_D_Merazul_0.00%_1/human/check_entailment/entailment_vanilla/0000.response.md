Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. The program does not correctly read the input. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read in the following format:

   - The first line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases.
   - The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, the length of the array a.
   - The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, the elements of the array a.
   - The third line of each test case contains a single integer q, the number of queries.
   - The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r, the boundaries of the query.

   However, the program does not correctly read the input in this format. It uses the R function to read the input, but it does not correctly parse the input.

2. The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l <= i <= r, l <= j <= r, and a_i != a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. It uses a complex and unclear logic to solve the problem, which does not correctly implement the required conditions.

3. The program does not correctly print the output. The problem requires printing two integers separated by space, i and j, for which a_i != a_j. If such a pair does not exist, it should print i=-1 and j=-1. However, the program does not correctly print the output in this format. It uses a complex and unclear logic to print the output, which does not correctly implement the required format.

Correctness: **False**
