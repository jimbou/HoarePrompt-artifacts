Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' is 0, and the standard output contains a series of strings, each of which is either 'Y', 'N', 'E', 'O', or 'S', depending on the values of 'f', 'm', and 'n' in each iteration. The values of other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.**
