Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. It uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it prints that number as the MEX. If a number is present only once and it's not the first occurrence of a number with a count of 1, it prints that number as the MEX. This is because Alice can choose that number to maximize the MEX, and Bob cannot choose it to minimize the MEX.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, when the array contains duplicate numbers, and when the array contains numbers that are not present in the range 0 to n-1.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
