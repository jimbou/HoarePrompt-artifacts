Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.
3. It creates a Counter object `mpp` to store the frequency of each element in the array.
4. It initializes a variable `first` to `False`, which is used to track whether a single occurrence of an element has been found.
5. The program then iterates over the range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`) and checks the following conditions:
   - If the current number `i` is not present in the Counter object `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the resulting array will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - If the current number `i` has a frequency of 1 in the Counter object `mpp` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, and Bob cannot pick it to minimize the MEX.
   - If the current number `i` has a frequency of 1 in the Counter object `mpp` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This is because Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, but Bob can still pick another element to minimize the MEX.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
