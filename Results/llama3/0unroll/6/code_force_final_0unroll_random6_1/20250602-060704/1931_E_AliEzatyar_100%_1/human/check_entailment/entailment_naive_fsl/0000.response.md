Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. The key insight is that Anna's moves can only decrease the total number of digits in the list, while Sasha's moves can only increase it. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list, counts the number of trailing zeros in each number, and simulates Anna's moves by subtracting the number of trailing zeros from the total number of digits. The program then checks if the resulting number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, which determines the winner.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `n` or `m` is 1. The use of the `func_1` function to count the number of trailing zeros in each number is efficient and accurate. The sorting of the `zeros` list in descending order ensures that Anna's moves are simulated correctly.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
