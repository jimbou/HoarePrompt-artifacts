Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `num[0]` is the number of test cases, each test case is a list of integers, the first two integers of each test case are the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, the rest of the integers in each test case are the list that Sasha gave to Anna, `counter` is 0**

In this output state, the code initializes a new variable `counter` and assigns it the value 0. The initial state of `num` remains unchanged, with `num[0]` being the number of test cases and each test case being a list of integers with the first two integers representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and the rest of the integers being the list that Sasha gave to Anna.
