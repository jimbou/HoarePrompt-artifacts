Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list where the value at each index `i` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `cou` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `arr` and `freq`, remain unchanged. The relationship between `arr` and `freq` is still maintained, where the value at each index `i` in `freq` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`.
