Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` by Alice, while Bob tries to minimize it. The program uses a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input array contains duplicate numbers, and it also handles the case where the input array contains only one number. The program also correctly prints the MEX of the array `c` for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
