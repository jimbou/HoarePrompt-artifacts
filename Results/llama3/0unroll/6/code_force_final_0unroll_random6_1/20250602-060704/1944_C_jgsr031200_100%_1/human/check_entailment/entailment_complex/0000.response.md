Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input array `arr` and calculates the frequency of each integer in the array using the `freq` list.
2. It then iterates through the `freq` list and checks for the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the array. This is done by checking if `freq[i]` is equal to 1 or 0.
3. If `freq[i]` is equal to 1, it increments the `cou` variable. If `cou` becomes equal to 2 or `freq[i]` is equal to 0, it prints the current integer `i` and breaks the loop.
4. The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains duplicate integers by skipping them using the `continue` statement.
5. The program also correctly handles the case where the input array does not contain any integers that appear only once or do not appear at all by printing the first integer that meets this condition.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
