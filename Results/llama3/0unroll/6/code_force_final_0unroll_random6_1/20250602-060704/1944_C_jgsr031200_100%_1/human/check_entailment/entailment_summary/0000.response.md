Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally. The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each integer in the input list `arr` and then iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). If an integer appears only once or does not appear at all in the list, it prints that integer and breaks the loop. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the game's score is the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program correctly handles the case where an integer appears more than once in the list by skipping it and continuing to the next integer. It also correctly handles the case where an integer does not appear at all in the list by printing the first such integer it encounters.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
