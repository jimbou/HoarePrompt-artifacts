Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code created a new list `freq` with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is presumably the length of `arr` or some other variable not shown in the initial state. The list `freq` is initialized with all elements being zero.
