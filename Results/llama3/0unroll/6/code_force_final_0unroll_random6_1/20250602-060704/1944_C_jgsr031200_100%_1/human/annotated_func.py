#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list where the value at each index `i` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list where the value at each index `i` represents the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer n as input, calculates the frequency of each integer in the list, and prints the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the list. The function modifies the input list by printing a value, but does not modify the original list or its elements.
