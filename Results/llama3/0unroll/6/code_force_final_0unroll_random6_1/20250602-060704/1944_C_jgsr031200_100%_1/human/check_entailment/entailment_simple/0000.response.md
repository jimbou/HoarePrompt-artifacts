Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program first reads the input array `arr` and creates a frequency list `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array. Then, it iterates through the frequency list and checks for the following conditions:

1. If the frequency of an integer `i` is greater than or equal to 2, it skips to the next iteration.
2. If the frequency of an integer `i` is 1, it increments a counter `cou` by 1.
3. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency of an integer `i` is 0, it prints the integer `i` and breaks the loop.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. By iterating through the frequency list, the program finds the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

The program's output is correct because it correctly implements the game's rules and finds the MEX of the array `c`. The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
