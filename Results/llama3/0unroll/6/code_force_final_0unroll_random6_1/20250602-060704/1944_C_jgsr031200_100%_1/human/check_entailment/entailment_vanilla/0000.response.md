Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and deleting them, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the elements of the array.

The program then defines a function `func_1` that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array using a list `freq`. It then iterates over the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to `n`) and checks if the frequency of each value is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it skips to the next iteration. If the frequency is 1, it increments a counter `cou`. If the counter `cou` is equal to 2 or the frequency is 0, it prints the current MEX value and breaks out of the loop.

The program uses a variable `big` which is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.

The program also defines several other functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used in the program, so they can be removed as well.

The program uses a variable `x` in the `dfs` function which is not defined anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.

The program does not handle the case where the input array is empty, but according to the problem description, the input array is guaranteed to be non-empty.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
