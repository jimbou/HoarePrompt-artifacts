Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to t, where t is the number of test cases, and all the elements at even indices are reversed, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

In this output state, the list `a` is created with integers from 1 to `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases. The elements at even indices in the list `a` are reversed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases.
