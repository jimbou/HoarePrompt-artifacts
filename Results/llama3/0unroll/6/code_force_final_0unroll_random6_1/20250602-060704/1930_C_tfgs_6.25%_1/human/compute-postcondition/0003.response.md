Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the last test case, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the last test case in descending order, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the last test case and values are their respective counts, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the last test case, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

Here's a breakdown of how the code affects the variables:

*   The first line creates a Counter object `counter` from the list `a`. This Counter object contains the count of each unique integer in `a`.
*   The second line converts the list `a` to a set, which removes any duplicate integers, and then converts it back to a list. This results in a list of unique integers from the original list `a`.
*   The third line sorts the list `a` in descending order.
*   The fourth line calculates the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` by subtracting the length of the unique list `a` from the original length `n`. This value is stored in `cnt`.
*   The fifth line initializes an empty list `ans`.

Note that the value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the code execution, as it is not modified by any of the lines. The value of `stdin` also remains empty, as it was initially empty and no input operations were performed.
