To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's effect on the variable `a`, which is the only variable affected by the loop.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`. In each iteration, the loop adds the current index `i` plus one to the corresponding element in the list `a`.

Let's denote the initial value of `a` as `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_(n-1)]`. After the first iteration, `a_0` becomes `a_0 + 1`. After the second iteration, `a_1` becomes `a_1 + 2`. This pattern continues until the last iteration, where `a_(n-1)` becomes `a_(n-1) + n`.

So, the output state of `a` after the loop executes all its iterations is:

`a` = `[a_0 + 1, a_1 + 2, ..., a_(n-1) + n]`

The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the last test case, `a` is a list of integers equal to `[a_0 + 1, a_1 + 2, ..., a_(n-1) + n]`, stdin is empty.
