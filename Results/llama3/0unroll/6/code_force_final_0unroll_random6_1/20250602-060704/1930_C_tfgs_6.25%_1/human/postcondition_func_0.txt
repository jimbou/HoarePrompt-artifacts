Reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it increments each integer by its 1-based index, removes duplicates, sorts the integers in descending order, and inserts duplicates in the correct positions to maintain the original count of each integer. Finally, it prints the resulting list of integers for each test case.
