Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1` reads a space-separated list of 0s and 1s from standard input, calculates the sum of the lengths of all sublists of consecutive 1s plus the total number of 1s, and prints the result. This function seems to be calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

Function `func_2` reads an integer from standard input, calls `func_1` that many times, and leaves the standard input empty. This function appears to be a test driver that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Based on the execution summaries, it seems that `func_1` is correctly calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted, and `func_2` is correctly driving the test cases.

However, there is a discrepancy between the problem statement and the code. The problem statement mentions that the input is a binary string, but the code reads a space-separated list of 0s and 1s. This suggests that the code is not correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
