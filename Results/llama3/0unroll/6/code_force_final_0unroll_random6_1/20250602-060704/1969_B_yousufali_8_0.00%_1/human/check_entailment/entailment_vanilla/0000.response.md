Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string as input, converts it into a list of integers, and initializes two variables: `n` to keep track of the number of consecutive 1's and `ans` to store the total cost.

The function then iterates through the list of integers. If it encounters a 1, it increments `n`. If it encounters a 0 and `n` is not zero, it means that there is a sequence of 1's before the current 0, and the function adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the sequence of 1's needs to be shifted to the right of the current 0, and the cost of this operation is equal to the length of the sequence plus one (for the 0).

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The provided program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The use of `n` to keep track of consecutive 1's and the addition of `n + 1` to `ans` when a 0 is encountered after a sequence of 1's accurately calculates the cost of the necessary operations.

Correctness: **True**
