The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an input integer greater than or equal to 1 first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains no input. 
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains no input**
