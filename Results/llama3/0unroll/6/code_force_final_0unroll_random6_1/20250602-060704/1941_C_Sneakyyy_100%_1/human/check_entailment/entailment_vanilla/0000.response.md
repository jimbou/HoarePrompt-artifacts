Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string (n) and the string itself (a).

3. It initializes a variable (ans) to keep track of the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

4. It then enters a while loop that iterates over the characters in the string. The loop starts from the first character and goes up to the third last character (since it checks for substrings of length 3).

5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current substring of length 3 is equal to "map" or "pie". If it is, it increments the answer by 1 (since one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful) and moves the index (i) 3 positions forward.

6. If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it simply moves the index (i) 1 position forward.

7. After the loop finishes, it prints the answer, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The program does not handle the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., it does not contain "map" or "pie"). In this case, the program will still print 0, which is correct, but it will do so after iterating over the entire string. This is inefficient, especially for large strings.

To fix this, the program could be modified to check if the string contains "map" or "pie" before entering the loop. If it does not, it can immediately print 0 and move on to the next test case.

Correctness: **True**
