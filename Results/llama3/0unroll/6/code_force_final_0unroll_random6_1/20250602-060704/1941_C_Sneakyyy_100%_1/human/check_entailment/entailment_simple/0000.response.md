Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates through the string, and whenever it encounters the substrings 'map' or 'pie', it increments the count and moves the index forward by 3 characters. If the current substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index forward by 1 character. This ensures that the program counts the non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is already beautiful (i.e., it does not contain 'map' or 'pie'), the program outputs 0, which is the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
