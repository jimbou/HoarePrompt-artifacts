Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two substrings, but it should be counted as one because the 'p' in "map" is also part of "pie". 

In this case, the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. 

The program should be modified to handle overlapping substrings correctly.
