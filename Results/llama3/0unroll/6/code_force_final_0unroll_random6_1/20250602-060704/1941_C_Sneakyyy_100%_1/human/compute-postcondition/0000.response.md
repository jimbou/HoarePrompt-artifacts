Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each representing the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the corresponding input string s. The count is calculated by iterating through the string and incrementing the count whenever 'map' or 'pie' is found, and moving the index forward by 3 characters in such cases, otherwise moving the index forward by 1 character.**
