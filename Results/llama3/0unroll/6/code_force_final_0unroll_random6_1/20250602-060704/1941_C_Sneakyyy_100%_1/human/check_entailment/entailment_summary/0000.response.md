Reasoning: 
The program is correct because it accurately counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the given string. It does this by iterating through the string three characters at a time, checking if the current substring is 'map' or 'pie', and if so, incrementing the count and moving the index forward by three characters. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index forward by one character. This approach ensures that the program does not count overlapping occurrences, which is in line with the problem's requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
