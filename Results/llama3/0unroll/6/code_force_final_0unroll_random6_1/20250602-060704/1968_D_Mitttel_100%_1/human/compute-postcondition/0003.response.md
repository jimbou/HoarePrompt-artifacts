Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of mx, which is the maximum of the current mx and the sum of cur and k times a[s], where cur is the sum of cur and a[s], k is k minus 1, and s is p[s].**

In this output state, mx is the maximum value that has been calculated so far, and it is compared with the sum of cur and k times a[s]. The value of cur is the sum of its previous value and a[s], and k is decremented by 1. The value of s is updated to p[s]. The program returns the maximum value of mx, which takes into account the updated values of cur, k, and s.
