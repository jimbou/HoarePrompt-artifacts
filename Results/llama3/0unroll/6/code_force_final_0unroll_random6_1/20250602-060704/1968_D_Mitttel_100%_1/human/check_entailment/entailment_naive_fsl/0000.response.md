Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. It uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position. This function iterates through the permutation, keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the current position or moving to the next position. The main function then calls `func_1` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for k turns, and it also correctly handles the case where the permutation has cycles. The use of the `vis` array in `func_1` ensures that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop when the permutation has cycles.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
