Output State: vis[s] is 1, k is 0, mx is the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s] for all iterations, cur is the sum of a[s] for all iterations, and s is the last value of p[s] in the loop.

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has visited the node s and marked it as visited (vis[s] = 1), the number of remaining iterations k has reached 0, the maximum value mx has been updated to the maximum value of mx and cur + k * a[s] for all iterations, the current value cur has been updated to the sum of a[s] for all iterations, and the node s has been updated to the last value of p[s] in the loop.
