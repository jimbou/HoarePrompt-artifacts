Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting from a given position `s` and making moves for `k` turns. The main program then calls this function for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where a player can stay at the same position or move to a different position, and it also correctly calculates the score for each turn. The use of the `vis` list to keep track of visited positions ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop.

The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the length of the permutation, by using the `while` loop to iterate until `k` becomes 0 or the player reaches a position that has already been visited.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
