Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= s[0] < len(p) and 0 <= s[1] < len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of zeros of length n.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
