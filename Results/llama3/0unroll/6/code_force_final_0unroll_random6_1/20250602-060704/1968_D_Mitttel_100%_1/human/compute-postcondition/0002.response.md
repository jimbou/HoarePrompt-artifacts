Output State: **vis[s] = 1, mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s]), cur = cur + a[s], k = k - 1, s = p[s].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the visited array `vis` has been updated to mark the current index `s` as visited, the maximum value `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of the current value `cur` and the product of the remaining iterations `k` and the value at the current index `s` in the array `a`, the current value `cur` has been incremented by the value at the current index `s` in the array `a`, the number of remaining iterations `k` has been decremented by 1, and the current index `s` has been updated to be the value at the current index `s` in the array `p`.
