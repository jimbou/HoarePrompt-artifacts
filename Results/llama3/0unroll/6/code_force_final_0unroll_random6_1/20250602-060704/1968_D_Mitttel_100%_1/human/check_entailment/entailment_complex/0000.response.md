Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum accumulated value for a given starting position, considering the cyclic nature of the permutation and the limited number of steps. The main loop iterates over each test case, reads the input, and calls `func_1` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions. The program then compares the results and prints the winner or a draw.

The function `func_1` works by maintaining a maximum value `mx` and a current sum `cur`. It iterates over the permutation, updating `mx` and `cur` at each step, until it reaches a visited position or runs out of steps. The maximum value is updated by considering the current sum and the remaining steps.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of steps `k` is greater than the length of the permutation, as the function will still return the maximum accumulated value.

Correctness: **True**
