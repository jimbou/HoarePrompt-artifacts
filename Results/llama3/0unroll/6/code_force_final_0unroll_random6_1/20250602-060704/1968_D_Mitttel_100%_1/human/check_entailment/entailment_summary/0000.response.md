Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  The `func_1` function is used to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by a player starting from a given position. This function correctly implements the logic to traverse the permutation `p` in a cyclic manner, accumulate values from the array `a`, and keep track of the maximum score that can be obtained with the remaining steps.
3.  The program correctly calls `func_1` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions and compares their scores to determine the winner.
4.  The program handles the case where the scores are equal and outputs "Draw" as required.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the "Permutation game" problem, and its execution summary accurately describes its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
