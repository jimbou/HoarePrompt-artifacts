Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is now a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
