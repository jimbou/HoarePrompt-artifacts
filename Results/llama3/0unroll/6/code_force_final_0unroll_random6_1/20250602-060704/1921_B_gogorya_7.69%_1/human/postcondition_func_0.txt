This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the number of boxes, the current state of cats in the boxes, and the desired state of cats in the boxes. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the current state match the desired state, considering two types of operations: moving a cat from one box to another and adding/removing a cat from a box. The function prints the minimum number of operations required for each test case.
