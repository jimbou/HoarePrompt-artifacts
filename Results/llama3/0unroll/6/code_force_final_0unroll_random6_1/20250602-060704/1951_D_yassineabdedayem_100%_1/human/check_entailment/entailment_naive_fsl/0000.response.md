Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, the program prints "YES" and the prices 5 and 1, but this is not a valid solution because Alice will buy 2 jewels at the first stall and 3 jewels at the second stall, for a total of 5 jewels, but she will have 4 coins left over.

The problem description requires that Alice buys exactly k jewels, but the program does not guarantee this. It only checks if n + 2 > k * 2, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to find a valid solution that ensures Alice buys exactly k jewels. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of stalls needed to achieve this.
