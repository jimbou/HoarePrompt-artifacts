Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two positive integers, n and k. It then determines whether it's possible for Alice to buy a certain number of jewels with her coins, such that she ends up with exactly k jewels. If possible, it outputs 'YES' followed by the number of purchases needed and the number of coins spent in each purchase. If not possible, it outputs 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' statements along with additional purchase information when applicable.**
