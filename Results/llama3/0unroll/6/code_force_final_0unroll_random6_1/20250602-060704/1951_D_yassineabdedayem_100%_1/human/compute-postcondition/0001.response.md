Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' statements, followed by either one or two numbers, depending on the values of n and k. If n equals k, the output will be 'YES', followed by 1 and then 1. If n + 2 is greater than k * 2, the output will be 'YES', followed by 2, then n - k + 1, and finally 1. If neither of these conditions is met, the output will simply be 'NO'. The number of these outputs will be equal to the value of t.**
