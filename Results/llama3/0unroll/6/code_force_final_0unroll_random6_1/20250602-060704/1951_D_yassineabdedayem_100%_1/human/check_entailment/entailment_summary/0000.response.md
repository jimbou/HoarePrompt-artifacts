Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  When `n` equals `k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy `k` jewels.

2.  When `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, allowing Alice to buy one jewel and leaving her with `k - 1` coins. The second stall has a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

3.  When neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
