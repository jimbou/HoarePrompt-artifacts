Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`. Then, it prints the minimum possible penalty, which is `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise `n`.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

* If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it means that the number of '+' characters is not equal to the number of '-' characters. In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to group all the '+' characters together and all the '-' characters together. The penalty of the '+' group is `n - neg`, and the penalty of the '-' group is `neg`. Therefore, the total penalty is `n - 2 * neg`.
* If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters. In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to group each '+' character with a '-' character. The penalty of each group is 0, and there are `n` groups. Therefore, the total penalty is `n`.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.

Correctness: **True**
