Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of the string `n`, and the string `s` itself.

2. The program defines a function `func_1()` that calculates the minimum possible penalty for a given string `s`.

3. Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of "-" characters in the string `s`.

4. The program then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is "-", it increments the `neg` counter.

5. After counting the "-" characters, the program calculates the minimum possible penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg`. However, if the number of "-" characters equals the length of the string (`n == neg`), it simply returns the length of the string `n`.

6. The program prints the calculated minimum possible penalty to the standard output.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the problem description's rules for calculating the minimum possible penalty. The formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty. The special case handling for `n == neg` is also correct, as it returns the length of the string in this scenario.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
