Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments and performs the following steps:

1. It reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the string `s`.
2. It reads a string `s` from the input, which consists of '+' and '-' characters.
3. It initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '-' characters in the string.
4. It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '-', it increments the `neg` variable.
5. It prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

The key insight in this program is that the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a subarray with a sum of 1 or -1 will have a penalty of 1 or -1, respectively.

The program achieves this by counting the number of '-' characters in the string, which represents the number of -1's in the array. It then calculates the result of `n - 2 * neg`, which represents the number of 1's in the array minus twice the number of -1's. This expression gives the minimum possible penalty, because it represents the sum of the penalties of the subarrays with sums of 1 or -1.

However, there is a special case when `n` is equal to `neg`, which means that the array consists of only -1's. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is `n`, because each subarray will have a sum of -1 and a penalty of 1.

Therefore, the program prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

Correctness: **True**
