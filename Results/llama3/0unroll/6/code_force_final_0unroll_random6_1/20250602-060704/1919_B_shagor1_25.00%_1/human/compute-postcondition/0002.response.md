The code prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s` of length `n`.

Since `n` is the length of the string `s` and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, the value of `n - 2 * neg` represents the difference between the total number of characters in `s` and twice the number of '-' characters. This can be interpreted as the number of '+' characters in `s` minus the number of '-' characters in `s`.

If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that all characters in `s` are '-', so the expression `n - 2 * neg` would be negative. In this case, the code prints `n`, which is the total number of '-' characters in `s`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to neg, otherwise n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of '-' characters in s)**
