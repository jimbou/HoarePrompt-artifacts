Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, s is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 5000. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`, which has a length of `n` and consists of characters "+" and "-". The third line initializes the variable `neg` to 0. Since `neg` is not modified by the code, its value remains 0. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and after reading two inputs, it now contains multiple test cases minus one.
