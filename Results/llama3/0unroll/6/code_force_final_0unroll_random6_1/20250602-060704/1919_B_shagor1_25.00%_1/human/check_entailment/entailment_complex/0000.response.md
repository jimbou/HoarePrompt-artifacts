Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
4. It iterates through the string `s` and increments `neg` for each '-' character found.
5. After counting the '-' characters, it calculates the minimum possible penalty by printing `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

The logic behind this calculation is as follows:

* If the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string, it means that all characters are '-', and the minimum penalty is simply the length of the string.
* If the number of '-' characters is not equal to the length of the string, it means that there are some '+' characters present. In this case, the minimum penalty is achieved by splitting the string into subarrays such that each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. This is because the penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and by making the sum of each subarray zero, we minimize the penalty. The number of such subarrays is `n - 2 * neg`, where `neg` is the number of '-' characters.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
