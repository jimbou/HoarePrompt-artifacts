Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for the given string s. The logic is to count the number of '-' characters in the string, which represents the number of -1's in the array a. The minimum penalty is then calculated as the total length of the array minus twice the number of -1's. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all the -1's together, resulting in a single subarray with a sum of -1 and a length equal to the number of -1's. The penalty for this subarray is then multiplied by its length, which is the number of -1's. The remaining elements in the array are all +1's, which do not contribute to the penalty.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the string consists only of '+' characters or only of '-' characters. In these cases, the program correctly outputs the length of the string as the minimum penalty.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
