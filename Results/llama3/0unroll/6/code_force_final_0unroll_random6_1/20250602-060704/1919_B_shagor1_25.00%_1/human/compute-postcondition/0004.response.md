Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, consisting of an integer n and a string s of length n containing "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates the difference between the length of the string and twice the number of "-" characters, but if the number of "-" characters equals the length of the string, it simply returns the length of the string. The result is printed to standard output.**
