Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program first removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, which does not affect the relative positions of the chips. Then, it counts the number of remaining zeros in the list, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where all chips are already in a single block (in which case the output is 0) and the cases where there are multiple blocks of chips (in which case the output is the total number of zeros between the blocks).

Correctness: **True**
