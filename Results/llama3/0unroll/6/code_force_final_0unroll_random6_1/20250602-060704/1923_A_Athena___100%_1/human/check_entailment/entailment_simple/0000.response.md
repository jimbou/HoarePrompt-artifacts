Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.
3. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the beginning and end of the list while they are zeros. This is done to ignore the free cells at the beginning and end of the ribbon.
4. It then iterates over the remaining elements in the list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) in between the chips. This is done by incrementing the variable `res` whenever a zero is encountered.
5. Finally, it prints the count of zeros (free cells) in between the chips, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
