Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where at least one a_i is 1.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` between 2 and 50, followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1, and at least one `a_i` is 1.
