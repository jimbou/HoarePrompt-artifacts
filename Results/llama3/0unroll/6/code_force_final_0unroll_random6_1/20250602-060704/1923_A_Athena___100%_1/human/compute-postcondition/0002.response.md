Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then removes leading and trailing zeros from each list, counts the number of remaining zeros, and prints this count for each test case. The original input lists are modified in the process. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to the console.**
