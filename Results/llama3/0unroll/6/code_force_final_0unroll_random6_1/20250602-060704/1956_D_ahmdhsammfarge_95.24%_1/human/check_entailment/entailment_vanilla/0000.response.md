Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(lst)`: This function finds the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the operation. It iterates over all possible ranges and calculates the sum of the elements outside the range plus the square of the length of the range. It returns the range that maximizes this sum.

2. `func_2(r, l, ops)`: This function generates the sequence of operations to transform the array within the range `[r, l]` into a sequence of identical elements. It uses a recursive approach to achieve this.

3. `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`: This function performs the operation on the array within the range `[r, l]` and generates the sequence of operations. It first checks if the minimum element in the range is 0, and if so, it performs an additional operation to set all elements in the range to 0. Then, it generates the sequence of operations using `func_2`.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of elements in the array by performing the specified operation. It uses a recursive approach to generate the sequence of operations, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5*10^5.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program:

* The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input list is empty. It should return a default value or raise an exception in this case.
* The function `func_2` does not handle the case where `r` is greater than `l`. It should return immediately in this case.
* The function `func_3` modifies the input list `lst` in place. It would be better to return a new list instead of modifying the original list.

Despite these minor issues, the program is correct and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
