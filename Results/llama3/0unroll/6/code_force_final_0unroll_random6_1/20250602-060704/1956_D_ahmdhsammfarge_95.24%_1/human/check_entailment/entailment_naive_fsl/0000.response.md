Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array. The function `func_3` is supposed to perform the operation, but it does not correctly handle the case when the minimum element in the range `[r, l]` is not 0. In this case, the program should set all elements in the range to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the range, but the program does not do this.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program will output `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the maximum sum, but the correct maximum sum is `[1, 1, 1, 1]` which can be achieved by setting all elements to 0.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the range `[r, l]` contains only one element. In this case, the program should not perform any operation, but the program will still perform an unnecessary operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
