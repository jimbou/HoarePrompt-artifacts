    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: r is the index of the first element of the subarray with the maximum sum, l is the index of the last element of the subarray with the maximum sum, and over_sum is the maximum sum of the subarray.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices of the first and last elements of the subarray with the maximum sum, where the maximum sum is stored in the variable over_sum. The returned indices are r and l, which represent the starting and ending positions of the subarray with the maximum sum.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the indices of the first and last elements of the subarray with the maximum sum. The maximum sum is calculated by considering all possible subarrays and their sums, including the sum of the elements outside the subarray and the square of the length of the subarray. The function returns the starting and ending positions of the subarray with the maximum sum.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that r >= l >= 0, and ops is a list that can be appended to.
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value or variable. The state of the variables remains the same: `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `r` equals `l`, and `ops` is a list that contains a new element which is a list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
    #State: r and l are integers such that r > l >= 0, and ops is a list that can be appended to.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three parameters: two integers `r` and `l` where `r >= l >= 0`, and a list `ops` that can be appended to. It recursively calls itself with `l` decremented by 1 until `r` equals `l`. Once `r` equals `l`, it appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. The function returns nothing, modifying the `ops` list in-place. The final state of the program is that `ops` contains new elements, each being a list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, where `r` and `l` are the original input values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list of lists of integers.
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then the current value of the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list of integers where the sublist from index r to l (inclusive) is [l - r + 1] repeated l - r + 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes in a list of integers, a range defined by two integers `r` and `l`, and a list of operations `ops`. It appends the range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the sublist of the input list from index `r` to `l` is 0. If it is, it appends another `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. It then appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`, calls another function `func_2` with the current state, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` again, and replaces the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new list containing the length of the sublist repeated that many times. The function returns the modified list.
