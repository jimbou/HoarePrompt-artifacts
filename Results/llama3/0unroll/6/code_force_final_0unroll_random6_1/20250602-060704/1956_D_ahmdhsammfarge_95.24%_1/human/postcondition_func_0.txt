This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the indices of the first and last elements of the subarray with the maximum sum. The maximum sum is calculated by considering all possible subarrays and their sums, including the sum of the elements outside the subarray and the square of the length of the subarray. The function returns the starting and ending positions of the subarray with the maximum sum.
