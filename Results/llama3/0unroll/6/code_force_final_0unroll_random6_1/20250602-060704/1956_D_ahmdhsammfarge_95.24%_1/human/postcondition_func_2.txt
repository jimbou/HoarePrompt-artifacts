The function takes in a list of integers, a range defined by two integers `r` and `l`, and a list of operations `ops`. It appends the range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the sublist of the input list from index `r` to `l` is 0. If it is, it appends another `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. It then appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`, calls another function `func_2` with the current state, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` again, and replaces the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new list containing the length of the sublist repeated that many times. The function returns the modified list.
