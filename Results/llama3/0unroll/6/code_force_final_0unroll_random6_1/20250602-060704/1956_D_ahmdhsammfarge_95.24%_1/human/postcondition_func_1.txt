This function takes three parameters: two integers `r` and `l` where `r >= l >= 0`, and a list `ops` that can be appended to. It recursively calls itself with `l` decremented by 1 until `r` equals `l`. Once `r` equals `l`, it appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. The function returns nothing, modifying the `ops` list in-place. The final state of the program is that `ops` contains new elements, each being a list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, where `r` and `l` are the original input values.
