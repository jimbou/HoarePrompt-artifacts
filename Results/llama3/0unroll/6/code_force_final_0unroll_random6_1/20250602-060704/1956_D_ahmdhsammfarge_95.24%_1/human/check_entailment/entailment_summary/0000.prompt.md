Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Function number 1 :
 Code:

def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0

    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the indices of the first and last elements of the subarray with the maximum sum. The maximum sum is calculated by considering all possible subarrays and their sums, including the sum of the elements outside the subarray and the square of the length of the subarray. The function returns the starting and ending positions of the subarray with the maximum sum.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function takes three parameters: two integers `r` and `l` where `r >= l >= 0`, and a list `ops` that can be appended to. It recursively calls itself with `l` decremented by 1 until `r` equals `l`. Once `r` equals `l`, it appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. The function returns nothing, modifying the `ops` list in-place. The final state of the program is that `ops` contains new elements, each being a list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, where `r` and `l` are the original input values.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function takes in a list of integers, a range defined by two integers `r` and `l`, and a list of operations `ops`. It appends the range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the sublist of the input list from index `r` to `l` is 0. If it is, it appends another `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`. It then appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`, calls another function `func_2` with the current state, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` again, and replaces the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new list containing the length of the sublist repeated that many times. The function returns the modified list.
