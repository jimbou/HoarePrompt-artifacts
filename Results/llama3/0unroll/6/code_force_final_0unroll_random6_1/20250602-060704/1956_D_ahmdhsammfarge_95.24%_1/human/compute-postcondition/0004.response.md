Output State: **r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of integers where the sublist from index r to l (inclusive) is [l - r + 1] repeated l - r + 1 times, and ops is a list of lists of integers where the last three elements are [r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1].**

Explanation:
The code first appends a new sublist [r + 1, r + 1] to ops. Then, it calls func_2(r, l, ops), but since the function's implementation is not provided, we assume it does not modify the state of r, l, lst, or ops. The code then appends another sublist [r + 1, l + 1] to ops. The variable n is assigned the value of l - r + 1. Finally, the sublist of lst from index r to l (inclusive) is replaced with a new list containing the value n repeated n times.
