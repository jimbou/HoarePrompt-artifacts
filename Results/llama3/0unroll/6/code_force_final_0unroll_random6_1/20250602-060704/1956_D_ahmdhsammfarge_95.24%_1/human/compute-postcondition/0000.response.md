Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last element of `ops` is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `ops` list, where a new element `[r + 1, l + 1]` is appended to the end. This means that the last element of `ops` is now a list containing the values of `r + 1` and `l + 1`.
