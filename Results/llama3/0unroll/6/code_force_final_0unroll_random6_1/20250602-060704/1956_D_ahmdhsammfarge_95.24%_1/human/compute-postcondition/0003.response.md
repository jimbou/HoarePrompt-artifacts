Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then the current value of the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`.***
