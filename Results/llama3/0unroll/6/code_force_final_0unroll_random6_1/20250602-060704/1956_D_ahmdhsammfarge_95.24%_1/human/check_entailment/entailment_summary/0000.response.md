Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the input array `lst` and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

2. The `func_1` function is used to find the subarray with the maximum sum. It iterates over all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and returns the indices of the subarray with the maximum sum.

3. The program then enters a loop where it calls `func_3` to perform operations on the subarray with the maximum sum. `func_3` appends the range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`, checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0, and appends another `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` if it is. It then appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`, calls `func_2` to recursively append more operations, and replaces the subarray with a new list containing the length of the subarray repeated that many times.

4. After the loop, the program tries to find the index of 0 in the list and sets the corresponding element to 1, appending the operation to `ops`. This is done to ensure that all elements in the list are non-zero.

5. Finally, the program prints the sum of the elements in the list and the number of operations in `ops`, followed by the operations themselves.

The program meets the problem description by maximizing the sum of the elements in the array and constructing a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The use of `func_1` to find the subarray with the maximum sum, `func_3` to perform operations on this subarray, and the final loop to ensure all elements are non-zero are all correct based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
