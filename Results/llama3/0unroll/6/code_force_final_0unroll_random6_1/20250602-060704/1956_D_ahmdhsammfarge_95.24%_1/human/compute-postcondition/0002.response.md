Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The current value of the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `ops` has been updated to include an additional element `[r + 1, l + 1]`, which is now the last element of the list. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is still 0.
