The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and then `t` strings `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. The integer `t` is assigned to the variable `t`. The remaining input in stdin is `t` strings `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` inputs: strings consisting of lowercase English letters**
