Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "ab", the program will output "ba" which is correct. However, if the input string is "abc", the program will output "cab" which is not the only possible rearrangement. The program should output "YES" and then one of the possible rearrangements, but it does not consider all possible rearrangements.

In the case of "abc", another possible rearrangement is "bca" which is not considered by the program. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
