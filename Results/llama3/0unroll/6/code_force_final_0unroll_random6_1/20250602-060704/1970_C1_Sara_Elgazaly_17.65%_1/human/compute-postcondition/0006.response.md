Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in the graph and its corresponding value is an empty list, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `False` because the code `s = not s` negates the original value of `s`, which was `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.
