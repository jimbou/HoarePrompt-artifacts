Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in the graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, a new variable `s` is introduced and assigned the value True. The values of the other variables, `x`, `y`, and `lst`, remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as no input operation was performed.
