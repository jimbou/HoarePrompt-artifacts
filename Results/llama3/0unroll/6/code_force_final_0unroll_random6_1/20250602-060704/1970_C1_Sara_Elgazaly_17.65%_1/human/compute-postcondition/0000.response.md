Output State: **x is an integer equal to n, y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.**

In this output state, the first line of the code assigns the values of the first two inputs from stdin to x and y, respectively. Since n is an integer (2 <= n <= 2*10^5) and t is 1, x becomes equal to n and y becomes 1. The second line initializes an empty dictionary called lst using the defaultdict function from the collections module. The stdin still contains the remaining inputs: n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.
