Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  It first calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
2.  It then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`). If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, it adds one to the result because a 2x2 icon cannot occupy a fraction of a screen.
3.  Next, it calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`).
4.  If the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells, it means that the 1x1 icons can fit on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. In this case, the total number of screens required is equal to `screen_require_for_y`.
5.  If the total space required for the 1x1 icons is more than the remaining cells, it calculates the extra space required (`extra_space`) and the number of extra screens required (`extra_screen`). The total number of screens required is then the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
