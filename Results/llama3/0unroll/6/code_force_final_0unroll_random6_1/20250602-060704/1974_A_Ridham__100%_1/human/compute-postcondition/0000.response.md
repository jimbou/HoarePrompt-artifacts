Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 10^4, `n` becomes an integer in this range. The second line initializes an empty list `result`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).
