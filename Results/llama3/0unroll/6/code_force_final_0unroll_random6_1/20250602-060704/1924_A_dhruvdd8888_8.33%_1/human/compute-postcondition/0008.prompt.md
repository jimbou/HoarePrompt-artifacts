Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters where each character is the kth character in a contiguous substring of s that contains all characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, and ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
