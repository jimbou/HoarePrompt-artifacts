You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters where each character is the kth character in a contiguous substring of s that contains all characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters where each character is the kth character in a contiguous substring of s that contains all characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, and ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The output state is a string of length n, where the first part is the concatenation of all characters in ans, followed by the character i from the set us, and then padded with 'a's to make the total length n. This string is printed for each character i in us that is not in win.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The output state is a string of length n, where the first part is the concatenation of all characters in ans, followed by the character i from the set us, and then padded with 'a's to make the total length n. This string is printed for each character i in us that is not in win.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
