Functionality: **This function determines if a given string contains at least 'n' substrings of length 'k' that contain all unique characters from a set of 'k' lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings exist, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it generates and prints all possible strings of length 'n' by appending characters from the set of 'k' alphabets to the existing substrings and padding with 'a's to make the total length 'n'.**
