Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
