#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters where each character is the kth character in a contiguous substring of s that contains all characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters where each character is the kth character in a contiguous substring of s that contains all characters in us, ps is the number of such substrings, and ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The output state is a string of length n, where the first part is the concatenation of all characters in ans, followed by the character i from the set us, and then padded with 'a's to make the total length n. This string is printed for each character i in us that is not in win.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines if a given string contains at least 'n' substrings of length 'k' that contain all unique characters from a set of 'k' lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings exist, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it generates and prints all possible strings of length 'n' by appending characters from the set of 'k' alphabets to the existing substrings and padding with 'a's to make the total length 'n'.
