Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, parsing the first line into three integers n, k, and m, and the second line into a string s. It then creates a set us containing the first k lowercase English alphabets and initializes an empty set win, an empty list ans, and a variable ps set to 0. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one test case has been read. The values of n, k, m, and s are determined by the input, and the values of us, win, ans, and ps are determined by the code.
