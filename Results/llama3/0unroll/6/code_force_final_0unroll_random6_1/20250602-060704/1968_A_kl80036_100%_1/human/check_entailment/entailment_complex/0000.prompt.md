Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of integers, each being one less than the corresponding input integer. For example, if the input is 3, 4, 5, the output will be 2, 3, 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of integers from standard input, subtracts 1 from each integer, and prints the resulting integers. It processes a number of integers specified by the first input value, which is expected to be between 1 and 1000. Each subsequent integer is expected to be between 2 and 1000. The function does not return any value but instead prints the modified integers to standard output.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
