The function reads a series of integers from standard input, subtracts 1 from each integer, and prints the resulting integers. It processes a number of integers specified by the first input value, which is expected to be between 1 and 1000. Each subsequent integer is expected to be between 2 and 1000. The function does not return any value but instead prints the modified integers to standard output.
