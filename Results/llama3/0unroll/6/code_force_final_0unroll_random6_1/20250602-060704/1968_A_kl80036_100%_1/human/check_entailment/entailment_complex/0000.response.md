Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply subtracts 1 from each input integer x and prints the result as y.

The key observation here is that when y = x - 1, gcd(x, y) is always 1 (since x and x-1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime). Therefore, gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x, which is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y.

Since the program correctly implements this strategy, it will always find a valid y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Correctness: **True**
