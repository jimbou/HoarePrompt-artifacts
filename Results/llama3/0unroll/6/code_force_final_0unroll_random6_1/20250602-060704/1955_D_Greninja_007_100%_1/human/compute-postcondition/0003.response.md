Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, cb is a Counter object containing the sorted counts of elements in b, ca is a Counter object containing the sorted counts of the first m elements in a. If the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between the first m elements of a and all elements of b is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.***
