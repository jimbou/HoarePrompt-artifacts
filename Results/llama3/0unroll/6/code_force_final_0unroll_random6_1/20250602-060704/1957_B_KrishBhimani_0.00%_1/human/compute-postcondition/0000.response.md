Output State: **The output state is a series of binary representations of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the first integer in each line of the input, and the binary representation is generated based on the second integer k in each line. The binary representation is generated by iterating through the bits of k from right to left, and for each bit that is 1, the corresponding power of 2 is added to the output list. If the length of the output list is less than n, the remaining elements are filled with 0. The output list is then printed.**
