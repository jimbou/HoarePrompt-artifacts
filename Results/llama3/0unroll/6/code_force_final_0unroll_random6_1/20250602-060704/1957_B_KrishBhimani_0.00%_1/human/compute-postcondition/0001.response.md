Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines, where each line contains two integers n and k. It generates a binary representation of the numbers from 1 to n based on the bits of k, and prints the resulting list. If the length of the list is less than n, the remaining elements are filled with 0. The function repeats this process for each input line.**
