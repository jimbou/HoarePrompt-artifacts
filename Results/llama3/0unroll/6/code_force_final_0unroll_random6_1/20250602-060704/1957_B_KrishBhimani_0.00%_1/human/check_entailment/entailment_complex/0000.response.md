Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the sequence a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the input values n and k.
2. It then creates an array `arr` to store the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of k.
3. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the output sequence.
4. It iterates through the `arr` array and for each index i, it appends 2^i to the `ans` list. This is because the binary representation of 2^i has a 1 at the i-th position and 0s everywhere else.
5. If the length of the `ans` list is less than n, it appends 0s to the list to make its length equal to n.
6. Finally, it prints the `ans` list.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the sum of the elements in the output sequence is equal to k, and it maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the sequence by setting the bits at the indices stored in the `arr` array.

Correctness: **True**
