Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of a modular multiplication of the corresponding element in the input list 'a' and the count of 'L's in the input string 't', modulo 'm'. The list is in reverse order, with the last element being the result of the modular multiplication of the last element in 'a' and the count of 'L's in 't', modulo 'm'.**
