Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers (a), and a string (t) of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function calculates the modular multiplication of each element in the list 'a' and the count of 'L's in the string 't', modulo 'm', and prints the results in reverse order. The function handles cases where the last character in the string 't' is either 'L' or 'R', and it correctly calculates the modular multiplication for each element in the list 'a' based on the corresponding character in the string 't'.**
