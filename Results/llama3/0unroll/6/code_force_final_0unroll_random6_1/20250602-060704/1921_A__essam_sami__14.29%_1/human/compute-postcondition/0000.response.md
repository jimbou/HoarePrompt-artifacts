The code accepts an integer t from the input, where t is between 1 and 100, and assigns it to the variable t. The stdin contains t test cases, each test case containing four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Since the code only reads the first integer t from the input, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t test cases, each test case containing four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000)**
