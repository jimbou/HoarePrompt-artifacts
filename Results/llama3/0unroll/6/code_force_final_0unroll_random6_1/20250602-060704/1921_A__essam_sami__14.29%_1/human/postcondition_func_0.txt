This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It calculates the squared Euclidean distances between two pairs of points for each test case and prints the minimum of these distances. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the minimum distance for each case, resulting in a series of minimum distances as output.
