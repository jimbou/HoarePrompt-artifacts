Postcondition: **The loop has iterated t times, and the variables a and b have been updated t times with the values from the input lines. The values of a and b are the last values read from the input lines. The rest of the execution state remains unchanged. If the sum of the current values of a and b is even, 'bob' is printed. If the sum of a and b is odd, 'alice' is printed.**
