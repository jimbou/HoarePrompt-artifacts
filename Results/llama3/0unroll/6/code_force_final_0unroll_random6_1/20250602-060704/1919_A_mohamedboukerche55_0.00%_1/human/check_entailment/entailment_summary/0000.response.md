Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem description states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then Alice will always have the opportunity to make the last move, because she can always choose to swap wallets or not swap wallets to ensure that Bob is left with an empty wallet on his turn. Therefore, Bob will win if the total number of coins is even.

On the other hand, if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then Bob will always have the opportunity to make the last move, because he can always choose to swap wallets or not swap wallets to ensure that Alice is left with an empty wallet on her turn. Therefore, Alice will win if the total number of coins is odd.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the two input integers and printing 'bob' if the sum is even and 'alice' if the sum is odd.

Correctness: **True**
