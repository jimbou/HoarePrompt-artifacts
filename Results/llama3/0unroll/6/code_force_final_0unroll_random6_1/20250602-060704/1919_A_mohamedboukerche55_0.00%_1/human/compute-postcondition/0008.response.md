Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. After reading all input lines, the function prints 'bob' if the sum of the last two integers read is even, and 'alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not modify the input values or perform any other actions beyond printing the result.**
