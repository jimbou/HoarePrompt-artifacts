Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the input, counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string, and prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input, including the number of test cases, the length of each string, and the strings themselves.
2. The program correctly counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in each string using the `count()` method.
3. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted by summing the counts of "map" and "pie" and subtracting the count of "mapie". This is because "mapie" is a substring that contains both "map" and "pie", so deleting it would remove both substrings.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The `count()` method counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings. This means that if a string contains multiple overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie", the program will count each occurrence separately. For example, in the string "mapmap", the program will count two occurrences of "map", even though deleting one "map" would remove both occurrences.

To fix this issue, the program should use a more sophisticated approach to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie", such as using a sliding window or a regular expression.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach to counting the occurrences of these substrings.
