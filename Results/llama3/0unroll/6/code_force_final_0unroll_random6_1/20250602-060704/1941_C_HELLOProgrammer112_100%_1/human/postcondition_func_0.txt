This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie' for each test case. The function does not modify the input string s or its length n. The output is a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the calculated sum.
