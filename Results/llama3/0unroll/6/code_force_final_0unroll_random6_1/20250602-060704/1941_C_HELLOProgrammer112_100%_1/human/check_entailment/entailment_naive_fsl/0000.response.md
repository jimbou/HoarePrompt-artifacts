Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapiepie", the program will count the substring "mapie" twice, once as "map" and once as "pie", resulting in an incorrect count.

In this case, the program will print 3 (2 for "map" and 1 for "pie"), but the correct answer is 2, because only 2 characters need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The program should be modified to handle overlapping substrings correctly. One possible solution is to use a sliding window approach to count the substrings "map" and "pie" without overlapping.
