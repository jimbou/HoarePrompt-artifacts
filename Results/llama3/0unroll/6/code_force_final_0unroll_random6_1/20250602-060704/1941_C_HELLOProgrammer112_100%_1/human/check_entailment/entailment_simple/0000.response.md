Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program works by counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string, and then subtracting the count of "mapie" (which is a substring that contains both "map" and "pie"). This is because if a string contains "mapie", it means that it contains both "map" and "pie", so we need to subtract the count of "mapie" to avoid double-counting.

The program then prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie" for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string, and then subtracts the count of "mapie" to avoid double-counting. This ensures that the program outputs the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
