Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the Hamiltonian path in the graph. The `func_1` function is used to query the graph and get the vertex with the minimum degree and the vertex that is not connected to it. The `func_2` function uses this information to construct the Hamiltonian path.

The program starts by querying the graph with the maximum possible degree (`n-1`) and then decreases the degree until it finds a vertex with a degree greater than 0. It then adds this vertex to the path and removes it from the remaining vertices. This process is repeated until all vertices have been added to the path.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly. It correctly handles the case where there are no vertices with a degree of at least `d` by continuing to the next iteration of the loop. It also correctly handles the case where a vertex is not connected to any other vertex by adding it to the path and removing it from the remaining vertices.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
