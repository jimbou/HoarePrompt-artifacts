Output State: **`path` is a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and the string "! [path]" where path is the list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order has been printed and the buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the buffer of the standard output stream, which means that any output that was buffered is immediately written to the output device. In this case, the string "! [path]" has already been printed, so flushing the buffer does not change the output. The values of the variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not affected by this code.
