Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), where v and u are vertices in the graph, path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**.

The code initializes two new variables: `path` and `remaining_vertices`. The `path` variable is assigned an empty list, indicating that it will be used to store a sequence of values, but its initial state is empty. The `remaining_vertices` variable is assigned a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. This set represents the vertices in a graph that have not been visited or processed yet. The `func_1` function and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
