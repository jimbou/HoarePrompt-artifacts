Output State: **The value of ans is Infinity, val is equal to the first element of arr, cnt is 0, and the values of flag, i, t, n, and arr remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is set to Infinity, `val` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. The values of `flag`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not modified by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
