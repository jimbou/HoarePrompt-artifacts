The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value and 0. Therefore, `ans` will be either its current value if it is less than 0, or 0 if it is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **The value of `ans` is the minimum of its current value and 0, `val` is equal to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and the values of `flag`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
