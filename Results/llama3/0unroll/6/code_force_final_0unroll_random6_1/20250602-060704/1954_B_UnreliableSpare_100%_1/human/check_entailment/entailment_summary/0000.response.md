Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal, and if so, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the elements are not all equal, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
