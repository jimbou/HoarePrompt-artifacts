Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.

If the elements are not all the same, the program then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. The minimum count is updated whenever a different element is encountered.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge case where all elements are the same. The use of the `Decimal` class to represent infinity is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
