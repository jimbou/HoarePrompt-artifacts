Output State: The loop will iterate from 1 to n-1, checking if the current element in the array is different from the previous one. If it finds a pair of different elements, it will set the flag to False and break out of the loop. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any different elements, the flag will remain True. The value of t and the contents of the array will remain unchanged.
