Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], the program will output 1, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program only checks for the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it does not consider the case where the second element is also alternating.

In this case, the program should output 2 because removing any two consecutive elements (e.g., [1, 2] or [2, 1]) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program only outputs 1, which is incorrect.
