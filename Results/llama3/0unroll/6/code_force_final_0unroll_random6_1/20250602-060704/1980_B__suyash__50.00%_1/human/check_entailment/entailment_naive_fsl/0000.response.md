Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES". This is because the favorite cube (with value 3) will always be removed, regardless of its position after sorting.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes. In this case, the program should check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes after sorting, but it does not do so correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated sorting algorithm that takes into account the values of the cubes, rather than just their indices.
