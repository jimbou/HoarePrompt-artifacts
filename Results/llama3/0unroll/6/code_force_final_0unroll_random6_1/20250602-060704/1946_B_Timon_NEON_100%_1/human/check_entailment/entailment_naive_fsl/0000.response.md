Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations to find the maximum sum.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers. In this case, the program does not correctly handle the insertion of the sum of a subarray at any position in the array. For example, if the input array is `[-4, -7]` and `k=2`, the program should return `999999996`, but it does not.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input array contains zeros. In this case, the program should return the sum of the original array, but it does not.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, and therefore it is incorrect.
