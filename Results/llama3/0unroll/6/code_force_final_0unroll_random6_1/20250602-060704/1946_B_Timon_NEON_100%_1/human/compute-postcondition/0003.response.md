Output State: **The list `segments_variants` contains all the segments of the list `arr` that have a sum greater than the sum of the list `arr` itself, plus two new segments: one that is a copy of `max_segment` with the last element of `arr` appended, and another that is a copy of `new_segment` with the last element of `arr` appended. The list `max_segment` remains unchanged. The list `new_segment` remains empty. The variable `max_sum` remains -1. The list `total_max_segment` is now initialized with a single element, -1.**

In this output state, the list `segments_variants` has been modified to include two new segments. The first new segment is a copy of `max_segment` with the last element of `arr` appended, and the second new segment is a copy of `new_segment` with the last element of `arr` appended. The list `max_segment` and the list `new_segment` remain unchanged. The variable `max_sum` also remains unchanged. The list `total_max_segment` has been initialized with a single element, -1.
