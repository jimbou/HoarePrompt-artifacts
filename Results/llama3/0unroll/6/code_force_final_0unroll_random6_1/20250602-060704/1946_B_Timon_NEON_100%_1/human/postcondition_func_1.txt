This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in the list that have more than one element. The function identifies segments by splitting the list at negative numbers and calculates the sum of each segment. It then compares these sums to find the maximum one and returns the corresponding segment, including its sum and the index of its last element. If no such segment exists, the function returns a default value.
