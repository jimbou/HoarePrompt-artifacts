Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads a positive integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, with each number followed by its corresponding index (starting from 1).

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not actually solve the problem as described. The program simply prints the numbers from 1 to n, with each number followed by its index, without considering the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. This means that the program does not actually maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
