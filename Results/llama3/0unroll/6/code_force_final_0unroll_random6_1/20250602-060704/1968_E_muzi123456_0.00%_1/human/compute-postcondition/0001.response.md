Output State: **t = 0, n = last input integer, i = last value of n + 1**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is set to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `n` retains the value of the last input integer read from stdin. The variable `i` is set to the last value of `n + 1`, which is the last value of the range in the inner for loop.
