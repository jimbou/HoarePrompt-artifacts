Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program simply prints the coordinates (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A better arrangement would be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This arrangement has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
