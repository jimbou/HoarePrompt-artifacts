The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains one input: a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 50) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t positive integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3). 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t positive integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
