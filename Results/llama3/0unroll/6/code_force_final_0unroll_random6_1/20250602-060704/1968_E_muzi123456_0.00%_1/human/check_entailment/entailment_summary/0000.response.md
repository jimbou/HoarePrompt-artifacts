Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The task is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. However, the program simply prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, with each number followed by its corresponding index (starting from 1). This does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", "1 3", which corresponds to the cells (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A better arrangement would be (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
