Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. The program reads input from standard input (`[*open(0)][2::2]`). This means it reads every other line starting from the third line (index 2), which corresponds to the lines containing the integers on the cards in the player's hand.

2. For each line, it splits the line into tokens (splitting on whitespace by default) and assigns the result to the variable `tokens`.

3. It then calculates the length of the `tokens` list (which represents the number of cards in the player's hand) and subtracts the length of the set created from the `tokens` list. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique integers on the cards.

4. The difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique integers represents the number of cards that have a pair (i.e., the number of integers that appear twice). This is because each integer that appears twice contributes to the total count but only once to the unique count.

5. The program prints this difference, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score by playing optimally.

Given the problem description and the provided program, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points the player can score.

Correctness: **True**
