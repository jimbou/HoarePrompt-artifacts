Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires finding the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The points are scored when a player places a card with an integer that already exists on the table.
2.  The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by a sequence of `n` integers representing the cards in the player's hand.
3.  The program reads the input and processes each test case by counting the number of duplicate integers in the sequence. This is done by splitting the input line into tokens (integers), converting the list of tokens to a set (which removes duplicates), and then subtracting the size of the set from the size of the original list. The result is the number of duplicate integers.
4.  The program prints the count of duplicate integers for each test case, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

The program's logic is correct because:

*   It correctly identifies the duplicate integers in the input sequence, which correspond to the cards that can be played to score points.
*   By counting the number of duplicates, it determines the maximum number of points that can be scored.

Therefore, the program accurately solves the problem and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
