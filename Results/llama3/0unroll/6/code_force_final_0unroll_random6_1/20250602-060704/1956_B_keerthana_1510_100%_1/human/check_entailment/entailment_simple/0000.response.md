Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input from stdin, skipping every other line (i.e., the lines containing the value of n) using the slice notation `[2::2]`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the first line of each test case contains the value of n, which is not needed for the solution.

2. For each remaining line (i.e., the lines containing the integers on the cards in your hand), the program splits the line into tokens (i.e., the integers) using the `split()` method.

3. The program then calculates the number of duplicate integers in the list of tokens by subtracting the number of unique tokens (obtained using the set `{*tokens}`) from the total number of tokens. This is correct because the problem statement guarantees that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence at most 2 times.

4. Finally, the program prints the result, which is the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
