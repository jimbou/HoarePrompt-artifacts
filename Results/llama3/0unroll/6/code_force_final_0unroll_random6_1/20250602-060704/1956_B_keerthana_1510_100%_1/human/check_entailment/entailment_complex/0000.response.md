Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a sequence of n integers. This matches the problem description.

2. The program counts the number of duplicate integers in each test case by splitting the input line into tokens (split()), converting the list of tokens into a set ({*tokens}), and then subtracting the length of the set from the length of the list. This is a correct way to count duplicates because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate elements.

3. The program prints the count of duplicate integers for each test case, which is the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing optimally.

4. The program processes all test cases in the input and outputs the duplicate count for each case, which matches the problem description.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
