Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. The logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, it calculates the number of screens needed by dividing the total number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each screen has 15 cells, and 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each). If the result is not an integer, it rounds up to the nearest integer.
2. It then calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. If there are enough remaining cells to place the 1x1 icons, it doesn't need to allocate additional screens.
3. If there are not enough remaining cells to place the 1x1 icons, it calculates the additional screens needed to place the 1x1 icons. It does this by dividing the number of remaining 1x1 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and rounding up to the nearest integer.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When there are only 1x1 icons or only 2x2 icons.
* When there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
* When the number of 2x2 icons is a multiple of 2 (i.e., it doesn't leave any remaining cells on the screens).
* When the number of 2x2 icons is not a multiple of 2 (i.e., it leaves remaining cells on the screens).

Overall, the program is correct and accurately calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons.
