This function reads a series of input pairs (x, y) from stdin, calculates a value t based on the given formula, and prints the calculated t values. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no values, instead, it prints the results directly to the console. The stdin is emptied after the function concludes, and the calculated t values are output as a list of integers, each corresponding to an input pair (x, y).
