The code accepts an input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the rest t inputs are two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). So `n` is assigned the value of `t` which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
