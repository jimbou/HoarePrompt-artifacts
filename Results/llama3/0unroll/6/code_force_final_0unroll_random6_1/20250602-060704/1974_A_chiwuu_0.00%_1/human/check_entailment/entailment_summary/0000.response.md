Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons of different sizes. The program takes the number of test cases as input, followed by the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons for each test case.

The program calculates the minimum number of screens needed by first determining the number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells) and then dividing the result by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows). If the result is not a multiple of 5, the program adds 1 to the result to account for the remaining cells.

Next, the program calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. This is done by multiplying the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and then subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons).

If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons, the program prints the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. Otherwise, the program calculates the additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by dividing the number of remaining 1x1 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and then adding 1 to the result if the number of remaining 1x1 icons is not a multiple of 15.

Finally, the program prints the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
