Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM", but it should output "12:00 PM". This is because the program sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 0, but it does not handle the case where `h` is 12 correctly.

In the program, when `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM' and then immediately sets it to 'AM' again, which is incorrect. It should only set `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12.

To fix this, the program should be modified to handle the case where `h` is 12 separately, like this:
```
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```
With this modification, the program should work correctly for all cases.
