Output State: **day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, stdin contains t strings, each of length 5, representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm)**

The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable n. Since stdin initially contains a single integer t followed by t strings, after reading the integer, stdin will be left with t strings, each of length 5, representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
