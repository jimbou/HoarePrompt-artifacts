Reasoning:

1. The problem requires converting a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent time in 12-hour format.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and performs the conversion.

3. Inside the function, it first sets the variable `day` to `'AM'`, which is used to determine whether the time is in the morning or afternoon.

4. It then reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases.

5. The function then enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads a string representing the time in 24-hour format, splits it into hours and minutes using the `split()` method, and converts them to integers using the `map()` function.

6. The function then checks the hour value. If it's 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to `'AM'`. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to `'PM'`. Otherwise, it sets the day to `'PM'`, but if the hour is 12, it sets the day to `'AM'`.

7. Finally, the function prints the converted time in 12-hour format using an f-string, padding the hour with leading zeros if necessary.

8. However, there is a logical error in the program. The line `day = 'PM'` is executed for all hours between 1 and 11, which is incorrect. This line should only be executed when the hour is greater than 12.

9. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
