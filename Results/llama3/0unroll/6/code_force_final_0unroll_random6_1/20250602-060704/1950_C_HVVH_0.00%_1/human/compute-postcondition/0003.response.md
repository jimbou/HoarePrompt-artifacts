Functionality: **This function reads a series of time inputs in 24-hour format from standard input, converts them to 12-hour format, and prints each time in the format 'hh:mm' followed by 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the time of day. It processes a specified number of time inputs, as indicated by an initial integer input, and leaves the standard input empty after processing all inputs.**
