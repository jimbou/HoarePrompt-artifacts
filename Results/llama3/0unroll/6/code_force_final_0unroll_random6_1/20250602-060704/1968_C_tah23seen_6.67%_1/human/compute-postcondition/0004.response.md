Functionality: **This function generates a list of minimum operations required to make each element in the input list 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr', starting from the first element. It takes a list 'arr' of n-1 positive integers and an integer 'n' as input, where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all x_i in 'arr'. The function returns a list 'ans' of length 'n', where the first element is 'arr[0] + 1', and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in 'ans' and the current element in 'arr', unless this sum is less than the current element in 'arr', in which case it is repeatedly incremented by the previous element in 'ans' until it is greater than or equal to the current element in 'arr'. The last element of 'ans' is the sum of the second last element of 'ans' and the last element of 'arr'. The input list 'arr' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.**
