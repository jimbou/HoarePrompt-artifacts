Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 positive integers, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all x_i in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[0] is equal to arr[0] + 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In this output state, the initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new list `ans` of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. Then, it assigns the value of `arr[0] + 1` to `ans[0]`, making it the only non-zero element in the list.
