Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 4 1

The program will output:

3 5 4

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 4 mod 3 ≠ 1.

The issue with the program is in the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`. This line assumes that adding `arr[i]` to `ans[i]` will always result in a number that is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, which is not always the case. A correct solution would need to find a different way to calculate `ans[i + 1]` that ensures the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` is satisfied.
