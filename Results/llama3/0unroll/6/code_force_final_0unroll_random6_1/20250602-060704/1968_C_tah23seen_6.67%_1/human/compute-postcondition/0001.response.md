Output State: **The list 'ans' now contains the minimum number of operations required to make each element in 'arr' greater than or equal to the corresponding element in 'arr', starting from the first element. The first element of 'ans' is 'arr[0] + 1', and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in 'ans' and the current element in 'arr', unless this sum is less than the current element in 'arr', in which case it is repeatedly incremented by the previous element in 'ans' until it is greater than or equal to the current element in 'arr'. The list 'arr' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.**
