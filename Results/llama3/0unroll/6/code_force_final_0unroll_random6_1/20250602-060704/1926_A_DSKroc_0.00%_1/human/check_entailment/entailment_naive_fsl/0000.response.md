Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of 'A's and 'B's are equal. In this case, the program will print 'B' because of the else condition, but the problem description does not specify what to do in this case. The program should either print 'A' or 'B' or handle this case separately. 

For example, if the input is "ABABA", the program will print 'B', but it should print 'A' because 'A' appears most frequently.
