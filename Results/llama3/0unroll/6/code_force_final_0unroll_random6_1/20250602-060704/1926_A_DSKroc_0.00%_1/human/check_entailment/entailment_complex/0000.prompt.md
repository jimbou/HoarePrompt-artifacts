Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 32) followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` iterations, where in each iteration, it has read a string of length 5 from stdin, counted the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and stored the counts in variables `ac` and `bc` respectively. The values of `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The final values of `ac` and `bc` are the counts of 'A' and 'B' in the last string read from stdin. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *The loop has executed `t` iterations, where in each iteration, it has read a string of length 5 from stdin, counted the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and stored the counts in variables `ac` and `bc` respectively. The values of `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The final values of `ac` and `bc` are the counts of 'A' and 'B' in the last string read from stdin. The value of `t` remains unchanged. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B' in the last string read from stdin, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a specified number of strings from standard input, each consisting of 5 characters 'A' or 'B', counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string, and prints 'A' if 'A' occurs more frequently than 'B' in the last string, otherwise prints 'B'.
