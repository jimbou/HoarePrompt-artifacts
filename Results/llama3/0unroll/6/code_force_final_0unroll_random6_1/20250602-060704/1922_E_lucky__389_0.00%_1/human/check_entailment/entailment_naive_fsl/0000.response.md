Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case when the input X is a power of 2. In such cases, the program will enter an infinite loop in the while loop where it tries to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to X + 1.

For example, if the input is X = 8, the program will not terminate because 2 ** (i + 1) will always be less than or equal to X + 1, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
