Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given Python program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 checks if there exists at least one position where two input strings (a and b) are both different from a third input string (c). If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position is found after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.

Func_2 accepts a positive integer t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, which is the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length n. It then calls func_1 with these inputs and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints out the results.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The func_1 function correctly checks if there exists a position where a and b are both different from c, which is a necessary condition for the existence of a template t that matches a and b but not c. The func_2 function correctly reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints out the results.

Correctness: **True**
