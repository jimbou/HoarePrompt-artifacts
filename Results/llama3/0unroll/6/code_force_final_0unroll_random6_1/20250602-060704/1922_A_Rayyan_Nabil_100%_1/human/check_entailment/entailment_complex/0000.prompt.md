Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: The loop will return 'YES' if there exists at least one position i where a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i]. If no such position is found after checking all n positions, the loop will finish without returning anything, and the state of the variables a, b, and c will remain unchanged.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO' regardless of the values of variables a, b, and c.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if there exists at least one position where two input strings (a and b) are both different from a third input string (c). If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position is found after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input strings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings of lowercase Latin letters of length n.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings of lowercase Latin letters of length n, results is a list of t elements, each element is the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the corresponding iteration, stdin is empty.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the results list is empty, and the values of t, n, a, b, c, and stdin remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result based on these inputs, which is appended to a list of results. The function is called `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer, and each call processes a new set of inputs. The function's purpose is to process the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` and produce a result, which is collected in a list and printed out. The final state of the program is that the list of results is empty, and the input values are unchanged.
