Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 checks if there exists at least one position where two input strings (a and b) are both different from a third input string (c). If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position is found after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'. This function correctly implements the condition for the template t to exist.

Function func_2 is the main function that reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input and output operations.

The given program meets the problem description, as it correctly checks for the existence of a template t that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
