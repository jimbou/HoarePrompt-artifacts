Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if there exists at least one position i where a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i]. If such a position is found, the program returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. If no such position is found after checking all n positions, the program returns 'NO', indicating that no template t exists.

However, the program's logic is flawed. The condition for a string to match a template is not only that the characters at the same position are different but also that the characters at the same position in the template are uppercase. The program does not consider this condition.

For example, consider the input:

    1
    2
    aa
    bb
    aa

The program will return 'NO' because it only checks if a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i], but it does not consider the case where the characters at the same position in the template are uppercase. In this case, a template 'AA' would match strings a and b, but not string c.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
