Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if there exists at least one position i where a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i].

Function 1, func_1, iterates over the characters of the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position i where a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i], it immediately returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO'.

Function 2, func_2, reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints the results.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly implements the condition for a template t to exist, which is that there must be at least one position i where a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i]. If such a position exists, it means that a template t can be constructed by making the character at position i uppercase in the template, which would make a and b match the template while c does not.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
