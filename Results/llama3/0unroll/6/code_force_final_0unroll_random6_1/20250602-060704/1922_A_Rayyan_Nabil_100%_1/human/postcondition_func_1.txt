The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result based on these inputs, which is appended to a list of results. The function is called `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer, and each call processes a new set of inputs. The function's purpose is to process the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` and produce a result, which is collected in a list and printed out. The final state of the program is that the list of results is empty, and the input values are unchanged.
