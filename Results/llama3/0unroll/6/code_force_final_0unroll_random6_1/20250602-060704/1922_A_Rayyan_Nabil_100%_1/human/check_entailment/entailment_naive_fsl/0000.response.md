Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. It does this by iterating over the characters of the strings and checking if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different from the character at the same position in `c`. If it finds such a position, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template `t` exists. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO', indicating that no template `t` exists.

The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It also handles edge cases, such as when the strings are empty or have different lengths.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
