Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3. The values of n and k are not affected by the code and are still valid as per the initial state.
