The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates and prints a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k equals n, the list contains n ones. If k equals 1, the list contains integers from 0 to n-1. For all other cases, the list contains a single -1. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the corresponding lists for each case.
