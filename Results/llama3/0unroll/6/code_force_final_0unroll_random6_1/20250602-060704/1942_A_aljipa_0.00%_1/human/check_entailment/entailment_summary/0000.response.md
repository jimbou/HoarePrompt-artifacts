Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1.  If k equals n, it generates a list of n ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2.  If k equals 1, it generates a list of integers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
3.  For all other cases, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid array a that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
