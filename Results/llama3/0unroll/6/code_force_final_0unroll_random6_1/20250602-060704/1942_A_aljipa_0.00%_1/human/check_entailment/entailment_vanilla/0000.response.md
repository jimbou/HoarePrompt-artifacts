Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` that satisfies two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`
2. Out of the `n` total cyclic shifts of `a`, exactly `k` of them are sorted.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by considering three cases:

1.  If `k` equals `n`, it returns an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.
2.  If `k` equals 1, it returns an array of numbers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because only the original array (not any cyclic shift) is sorted.
3.  If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, it returns an array containing only -1. This is correct because there is no array that satisfies the given conditions for `k` not equal to 1 or `n`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
