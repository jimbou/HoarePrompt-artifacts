Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [-1], which is incorrect. According to the problem description, there should be a valid array a that satisfies the requirements, but the program fails to find it.

In fact, the program only handles two cases: when k is equal to n, and when k is equal to 1. For all other cases, it simply outputs [-1], which is not a valid solution.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle all possible cases, not just the two special cases it currently handles.
