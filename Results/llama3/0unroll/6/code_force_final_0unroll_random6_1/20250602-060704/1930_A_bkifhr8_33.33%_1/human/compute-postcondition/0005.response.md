Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to the console. It accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by 2n integers. The function calculates the minimum sum of pairs of integers for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result to the console. The function does not modify the input variables, and its output is a series of integers representing the minimum sum of pairs for each test case.**
