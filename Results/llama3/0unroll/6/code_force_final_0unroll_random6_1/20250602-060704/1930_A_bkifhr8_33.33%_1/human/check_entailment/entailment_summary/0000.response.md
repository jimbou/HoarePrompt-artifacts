Reasoning: 

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program is removing elements from the list while iterating through it, which can lead to incorrect results. 

2. The program is not sorting the list of integers, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum sum of pairs is achieved.

3. The program is not correctly handling the case when there are more than two elements left in the list.

4. The program is using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list, which is incorrect. This will remove the first element twice, not the first two elements.

5. The program is using `if len(lst) != 2:` to check if there are more than two elements left in the list, but this condition is not necessary and can be removed.

6. The program is using `break` to exit the loop when there are only two elements left in the list, but this is not necessary and can be removed.

7. The program is not correctly handling the case when there are an odd number of elements in the list.

8. The program is not correctly handling the case when the input list is empty.

Correctness: **False**
