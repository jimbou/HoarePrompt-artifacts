Output State: The variable ans_f is still a list containing t integers, each representing the minimum sum of pairs of integers from the input test cases. The variable t is still an integer between 1 and 5000, and stdin is empty since all inputs have been consumed by the loop. The loop has printed each integer in ans_f to the console, but the values of ans_f and t remain unchanged.
