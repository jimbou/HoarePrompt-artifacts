The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `t` becomes an integer between 1 and 5000. The second line initializes an empty list `ans_f`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**
