Output State: The variable ans_f is still a list containing t integers, each representing the minimum sum of pairs of integers from the input test cases. The variable t is still an integer between 1 and 5000, and stdin is empty since all inputs have been consumed by the loop. Additionally, the output of the program now includes the values of the elements in the ans_f list, printed one per line, in the order they appear in the list.
