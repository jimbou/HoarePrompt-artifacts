Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers.

4. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM.

5. It calculates the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes by summing up the amounts calculated in the previous step.

6. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

7. Otherwise, it prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues:

- The variable `sumo` is not necessary and can be removed. The condition `if sum(a) >= prod:` can be used directly.

- The variable `ans` is not necessary and can be removed. The amounts can be printed directly using `print(*a)`.

- The function `func` is not necessary and can be removed. The code can be written directly in the main scope.

- The variable `T` is not used and can be removed. The loop can be written directly as `for _ in range(t):`.

- The input and output can be improved for better readability.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(l):
    g = 1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
    return g

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    a = [prod // x for x in a]
    if sum(a) >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(*a)
```

Correctness: **True**
