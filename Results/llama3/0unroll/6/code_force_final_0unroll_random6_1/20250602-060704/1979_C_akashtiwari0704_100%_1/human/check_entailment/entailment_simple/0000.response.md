Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using a custom function `lcm`. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. The sum of these amounts is compared to the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it outputs the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM and the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. The comparison of the sum of these amounts to the LCM is also correct, as it ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
