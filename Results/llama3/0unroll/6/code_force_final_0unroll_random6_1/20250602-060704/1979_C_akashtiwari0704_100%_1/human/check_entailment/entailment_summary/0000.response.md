Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.
3.  It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function.
4.  It then calculates the amount to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
5.  The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
6.  If the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, it outputs the bets for each outcome, separated by spaces.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
