Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the n integers, then divides the LCM by each integer and sums the results. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it outputs -1; otherwise, it outputs a string of the LCM divided by each integer, separated by spaces. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results to standard output, leaving the standard input empty.**
