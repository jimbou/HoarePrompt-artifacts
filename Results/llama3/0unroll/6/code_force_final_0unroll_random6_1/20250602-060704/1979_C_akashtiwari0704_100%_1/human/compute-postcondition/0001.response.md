Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the standard output contains the results of the least common multiple (LCM) calculations for each test case. For each test case, if the sum of the LCMs divided by each number is greater than or equal to the LCM of all numbers, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a string of numbers, each representing the LCM divided by the corresponding number, separated by spaces. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the standard input is empty after reading all test cases.**
