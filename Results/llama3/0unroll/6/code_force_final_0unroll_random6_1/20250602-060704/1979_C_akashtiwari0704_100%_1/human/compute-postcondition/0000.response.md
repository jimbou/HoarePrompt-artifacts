Output State: **`t` is a positive integer larger than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer larger than or equal to 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
