t is a positive integer, for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 <= k <= 2*10^5. For each test case, there are m lines, each containing three positive integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
