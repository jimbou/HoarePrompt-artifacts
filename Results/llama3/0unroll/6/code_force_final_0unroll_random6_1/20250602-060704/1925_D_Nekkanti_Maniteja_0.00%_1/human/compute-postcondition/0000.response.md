Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a test case. The calculation involves modular arithmetic with a large modulus (10^9 + 7), and the result is the sum of products of the inverse of the number of pairs of nodes in a graph, the number of edges, and the sum of edge weights, all taken modulo the large modulus. The output state is a series of these results, one for each test case.**
