Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer t, followed by 3 integers n, m, and k, and m lines of three integers each. It then performs a calculation involving modular arithmetic with a large modulus (10^9 + 7), using the inverse of the number of pairs of nodes in a graph, the number of edges, and the sum of edge weights. The result is the sum of products of these values, taken modulo the large modulus. The function prints the result for each test case, one per line.**
