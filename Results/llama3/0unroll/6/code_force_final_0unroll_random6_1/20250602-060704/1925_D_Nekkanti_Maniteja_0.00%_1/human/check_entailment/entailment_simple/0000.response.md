Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

2. It calculates the inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is done using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, which is a common way to calculate modular inverses in Python.

3. It initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to store the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

4. It initializes a variable `a` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. It then reads the `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, which represent the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. It adds up the friendship values in the variable `a`.

6. It then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. This is done by iterating `k` times, and in each iteration, it adds the product of the inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, the current excursion number `i`, the inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children again, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the sum of the initial friendship values `a`, all taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

7. Finally, it prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, which is `âˆ‘[i=1 to k] (c * i * c * m + c * a) mod M`, where `c` is the inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values, and `M` is the modulus `10^9 + 7`.

Correctness: **True**
