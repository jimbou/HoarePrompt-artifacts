Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers in each line are selected from the input list a, with the goal of maximizing the number of pairs of identical integers. The selection process prioritizes pairs of identical integers from the left half of the list, then pairs from the right half, and finally single integers from the left half. The output lines are generated for each test case, with the number of test cases determined by the initial value of T.**
