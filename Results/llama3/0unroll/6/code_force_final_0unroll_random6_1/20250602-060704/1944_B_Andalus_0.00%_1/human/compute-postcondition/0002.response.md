Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function processes each test case by splitting the integers into two halves, sorting them, and then selecting k integers to output. The selection prioritizes pairs of identical integers from the left half, then pairs from the right half, and finally single integers from the left half. The function outputs the selected integers for each test case, with the goal of maximizing the number of pairs of identical integers.**
