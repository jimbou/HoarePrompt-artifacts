#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.

    #State: The output state is a series of lines, each containing k integers. The integers in each line are selected from the input list a, with the goal of maximizing the number of pairs of identical integers. The selection process prioritizes pairs of identical integers from the left half of the list, then pairs from the right half, and finally single integers from the left half. The output lines are generated for each test case, with the number of test cases determined by the initial value of T.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function processes each test case by splitting the integers into two halves, sorting them, and then selecting k integers to output. The selection prioritizes pairs of identical integers from the left half, then pairs from the right half, and finally single integers from the left half. The function outputs the selected integers for each test case, with the goal of maximizing the number of pairs of identical integers.
