Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and counting the number of indices where the element is greater than the previous one.

The program uses a greedy approach to split the array into two subsequences. It maintains two variables `a` and `b` to store the maximum values of the two subsequences. It iterates through the array and for each element, it checks if it can be added to the first subsequence (i.e., `a`) or the second subsequence (i.e., `b`). If the element is greater than both `a` and `b`, it increments the penalty counter `c` and updates `a` to the current element.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array has only one element or all elements are the same. In these cases, the penalty is 0, which is correctly calculated by the program.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
