This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the integers, then iteratively applying a series of operations to maximize the sum of the elements. The operations involve adding differences between consecutive elements to the sum, subject to a limit k. The function returns a list of maximum possible sums for each test case, which are then printed to the console.
