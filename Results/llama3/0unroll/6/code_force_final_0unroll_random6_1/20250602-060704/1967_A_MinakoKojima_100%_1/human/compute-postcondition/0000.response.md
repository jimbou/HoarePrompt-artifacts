Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).**

The code initializes an empty list `ans_list`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n, k, and a_i are still within their specified ranges.
