This function determines whether a given value 'a' is greater than or equal to a calculated value 's' for multiple test cases. It accepts a series of inputs from the user, where each input consists of three integers: 'k', 'x', and 'a'. The function calculates the value of 's' based on 'k' and 'x', and then prints 'Yes' if 'a' is greater than or equal to 's', and 'No' otherwise. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases 't', and outputs a series of 'Yes' or 'No' results.
