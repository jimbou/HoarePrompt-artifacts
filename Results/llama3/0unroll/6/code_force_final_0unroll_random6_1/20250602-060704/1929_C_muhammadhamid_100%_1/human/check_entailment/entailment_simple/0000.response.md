Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants based on the casino's rules and his initial number of coins. The program calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee winning any number of coins.

The calculation is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row. In each loss, Sasha's bet amount is increased by the minimum amount required to win back the lost coins. The total amount of coins Sasha needs to have is the sum of the initial bet amount and the increased bet amounts for each loss.

The program then compares the calculated minimum number of coins with Sasha's initial number of coins. If Sasha's initial number of coins is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum, the program outputs "Yes", indicating that Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants. Otherwise, it outputs "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
