Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins in a casino game with certain rules. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee winning, and then checks if the initial amount of coins is greater than or equal to this minimum amount.

The program uses a loop to calculate the minimum amount of coins needed, which is the sum of the initial bet and the maximum amount that can be lost in x consecutive losses. The maximum amount that can be lost in x consecutive losses is calculated by repeatedly adding the minimum amount needed to win back the previous loss, which is s // (k - 1) + 1, where s is the current amount of coins.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum amount, and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise.

The program correctly implements the logic of the problem and handles all the possible cases. It also follows the format of the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
