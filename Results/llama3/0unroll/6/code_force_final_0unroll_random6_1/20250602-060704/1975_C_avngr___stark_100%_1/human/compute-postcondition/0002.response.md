Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum possible second maximum number that can be obtained by considering all possible subarrays of size 3. If a test case has only two integers, it simply prints the smaller of the two. The function prints the result for each test case and leaves the input stream empty after processing all test cases.**
