Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 500. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` between 2 and 10^5, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` between 1 and 10^9.
