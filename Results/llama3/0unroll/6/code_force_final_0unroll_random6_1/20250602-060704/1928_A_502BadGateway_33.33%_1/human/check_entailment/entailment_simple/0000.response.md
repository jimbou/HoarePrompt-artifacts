Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

However, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, and it does not consider the case where `a` is even. Therefore, the function will return incorrect results for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd.

For example, if the input is `4 3`, the function will return `'no'`, but according to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `4 x 1.5` rectangles, and then form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is different from the original `4 x 3` rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
