Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the value of `b` is even or not, and returns 'yes' if it is even and 'no' if it is odd. However, this does not accurately solve the problem.

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program does not take into account the value of `a` or the relationship between `a` and `b`.

For example, the program would return 'yes' for the input `1 2`, but it is not possible to form a different rectangle from a `1 x 2` rectangle. Similarly, the program would return 'no' for the input `3 3`, but it is possible to form a different rectangle from a `3 x 3` rectangle by cutting it into two `3 x 1` rectangles and rearranging them into a `1 x 6` rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
