Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking if the width of the rectangle (b) is even. If it is, the program prints 'yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle from the original one. If the width is odd, the program prints 'no'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not guarantee that the width of the rectangle will always be even when Bob can obtain another rectangle. In fact, the problem statement provides a counterexample where the width is odd (3 x 2) and Bob can still obtain another rectangle (1 x 6).

Moreover, the program does not consider the case where the length of the rectangle (a) is even. In this case, Bob can also obtain another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two equal halves and rotating them.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
