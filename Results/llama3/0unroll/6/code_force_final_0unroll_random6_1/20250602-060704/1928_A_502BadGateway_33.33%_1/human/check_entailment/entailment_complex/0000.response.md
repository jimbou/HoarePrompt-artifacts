Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine if Bob can obtain some other rectangle from the given rectangle of size a x b. However, the function func_1(a, b) only checks if b is an even positive integer. It does not consider the value of a or the relationship between a and b.

The problem statement requires that the two resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved to form another rectangle. The function does not take this into account. For example, if a = 3 and b = 2, the function will return 'no', but Bob can actually form another rectangle by cutting the 3 x 2 rectangle into two 3 x 1 rectangles and then forming a 1 x 6 rectangle.

Therefore, the function is not correctly implementing the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
