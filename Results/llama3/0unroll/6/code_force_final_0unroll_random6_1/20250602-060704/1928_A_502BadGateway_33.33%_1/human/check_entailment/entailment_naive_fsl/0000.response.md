Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 2, the program outputs 'no', but according to the problem description, the 3 x 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 x 1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 x 6 rectangle can be formed, which is a different rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the width (b) is even, but it does not consider the case where the length (a) is even. In the case of 3 x 2, the length (a) is odd, but the width (b) is even, and the program incorrectly outputs 'no'.

To fix this issue, the program should check if either the length (a) or the width (b) is even, and output 'yes' if either condition is true.
