Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations, and it correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the user's move.

The program first reads the input and initializes the variables n and k. It then iterates over the k moves, updating the value of n based on whether the move is mirrored by the computer or not. After that, it calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The function func_1 uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. It initializes a list dp with the first two Fibonacci numbers, and then iterates from 2 to n, calculating the next Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7. The Fibonacci numbers are used to calculate the number of possible configurations, and the result is returned.

The execution summary is incorrect, as the function func_1 does not always return 1. It returns the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which can be any number.

Correctness: **True**
