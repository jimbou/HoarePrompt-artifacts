Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where the row and column are different, and subtracting 1 from n for each move where the row and column are the same.

The program then calls the function func_1(n) to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for each value of n from 1 to the input n.

The function func_1(n) is correct because it correctly calculates the number of configurations for each value of n. The base cases are dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1, which are correct because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board and one way to place a rook on a 2x2 board.

For each value of n from 2 to the input n, the function calculates the number of configurations as (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9). This is correct because it takes into account the number of ways to place a rook on the current row, which is dp[-1], and the number of ways to place a rook on the previous row, which is dp[-2]. The factor of 2 * (i - 1) accounts for the fact that there are i - 1 ways to place a rook on the current row that do not attack any rooks on the previous row.

The program then prints the result of func_1(n) for each test case.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
