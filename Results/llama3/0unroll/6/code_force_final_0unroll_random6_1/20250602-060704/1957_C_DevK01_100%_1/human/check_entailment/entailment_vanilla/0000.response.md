Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the task is to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program first reads the number of test cases, t. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, n, and the number of moves already played, k. It then reads the k moves, each represented by two integers, r and c, denoting the row and column of the move.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where r is not equal to c (since the computer can mirror the move) and subtracting 1 from n for each move where r is equal to c (since the computer cannot mirror the move).

The program then calls the function func_1 with the remaining number of valid moves, n, as an argument. The function func_1 calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two elements as 1, representing the base cases where n is 0 or 1. It then iterates from 2 to n, calculating the number of configurations for each i by adding the number of configurations for i-1 (dp[-1]) and 2 times the number of configurations for i-2 (dp[-2]) multiplied by i-1, and taking the result modulo 10^9+7. The function returns the last element of the list dp, which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the given n.

The program then prints the result of func_1(n) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
