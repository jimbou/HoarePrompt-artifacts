Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program correctly calculates this by iterating over the remaining valid moves and using dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The function `func_1(n)` calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the number of possible configurations. The Fibonacci sequence is used because each move can be either a white rook or a black rook, and the number of possible configurations doubles with each move.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when r = c) by decrementing n by 1 instead of 2.

The output state of the program is correct, as it returns the last element of the list `dp`, which is equal to the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
