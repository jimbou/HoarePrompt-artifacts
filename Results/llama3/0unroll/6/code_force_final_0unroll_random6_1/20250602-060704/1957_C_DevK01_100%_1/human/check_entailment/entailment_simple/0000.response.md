Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves.

For each move, if the coordinates are different (i.e., the move is not on the diagonal), it decrements n by 2, because both the row and column are blocked by the move and the computer's mirrored move. If the coordinates are the same (i.e., the move is on the diagonal), it decrements n by 1, because only the diagonal is blocked.

After processing all moves, it calls the function func_1 with the updated value of n. The function calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming.

The dynamic programming solution is based on the fact that the number of configurations for a board of size n is equal to the number of configurations for a board of size n-1 plus 2 times the number of configurations for a board of size n-2. This is because for each configuration of the board of size n-1, we can add a rook in one of two ways: either on the diagonal or not on the diagonal. If we add a rook on the diagonal, we block only the diagonal, and if we add a rook not on the diagonal, we block both the row and column.

The function initializes a list dp with the base cases [1, 1], then iteratively calculates the number of configurations for larger boards by appending the calculated value to the list and removing the first element. Finally, it returns the last element of the list, which is the number of configurations for the board of size n.

Correctness: **True**
