Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two dictionaries, mod_x_map and mod_y_map, to store the counts of numbers in the array that have the same remainder when divided by x and y, respectively. It then iterates through the array, updating the counts in the dictionaries and adding the counts of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y to the total count.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is currently counting pairs of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y, but it should be counting pairs of numbers where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

To fix this error, the program should be modified to count pairs of numbers where a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) and a_i % y == a_j % y. This can be achieved by updating the mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries accordingly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get((x - mod_x) % x, 0) * mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_map[mod_x] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

Correctness: **False**
