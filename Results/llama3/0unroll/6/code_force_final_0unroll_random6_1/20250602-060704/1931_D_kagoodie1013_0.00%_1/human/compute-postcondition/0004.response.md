Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case to count the total number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the conditions `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, and returns a list of these counts for all test cases. The input list of test cases remains unchanged.**
