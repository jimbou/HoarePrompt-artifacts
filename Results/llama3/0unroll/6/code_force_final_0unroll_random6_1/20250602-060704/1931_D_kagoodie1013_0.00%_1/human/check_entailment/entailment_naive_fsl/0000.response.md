Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it counts the beautiful pairs. The program increments the count by the sum of the occurrences of the modular inverses of the current number with respect to x and y. However, this approach is incorrect because it counts each pair twice (once for each number in the pair) and also counts pairs where the two numbers are the same.

For example, consider the input:

    3 2 2
    1 1 1

The program will output 6, but the correct output should be 0, because there are no beautiful pairs in this array.

To fix this issue, the program should only count each pair once and ignore pairs where the two numbers are the same. One possible solution is to use a hash map to store the occurrences of each number modulo x and y, and then iterate over the array again to count the beautiful pairs.
