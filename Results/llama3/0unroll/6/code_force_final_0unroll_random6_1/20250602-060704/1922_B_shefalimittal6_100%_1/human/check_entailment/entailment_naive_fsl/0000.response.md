Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program first counts the frequency of each stick length using the array `v`. Then, it iterates through the array and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

The program correctly handles the cases where there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, and at least 3 sticks of the same length. It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the remaining sticks.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks. The program also correctly handles the input and output formats.

After carefully examining the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
