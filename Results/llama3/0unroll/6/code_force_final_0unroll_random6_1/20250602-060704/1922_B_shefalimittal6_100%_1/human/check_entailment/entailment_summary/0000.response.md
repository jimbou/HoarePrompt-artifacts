Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The program first counts the frequency of each stick length, then calculates the number of pairs and triples of equal stick lengths. The program also correctly handles the case where there are less than 3 sticks of the same length.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas to calculate the number of pairs and triples. The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the input from standard input and printing the results as a string, with each result separated by a newline character.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
