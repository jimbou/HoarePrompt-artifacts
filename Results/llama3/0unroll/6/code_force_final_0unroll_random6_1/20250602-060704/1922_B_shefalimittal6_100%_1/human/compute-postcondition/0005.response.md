Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain a positive integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n, followed by n integers between 0 and n. The function calculates the number of pairs and triples of equal integers in each test case and prints the results as a string, with each result separated by a newline character. The function does not modify the input data and does not have any side effects beyond printing the results.**
