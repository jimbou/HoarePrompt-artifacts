The code prints a string containing all elements of the results list, separated by newline characters.
Since the exact elements of the results list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string containing all elements of the results list, separated by newline characters.
Output: **a string containing all elements of the results list, separated by newline characters**
