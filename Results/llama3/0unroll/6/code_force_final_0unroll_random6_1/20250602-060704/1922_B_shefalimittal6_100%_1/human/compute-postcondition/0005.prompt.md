You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+2*t*n integers, where t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer is t. Then for each test case, the first integer is n, and the following n integers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 <= a_i <= n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, idx is t+1, results is a list of t strings, data contains t+2*t*n-1 integers, stdin is empty
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: a string containing all elements of the results list, separated by newline characters

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
