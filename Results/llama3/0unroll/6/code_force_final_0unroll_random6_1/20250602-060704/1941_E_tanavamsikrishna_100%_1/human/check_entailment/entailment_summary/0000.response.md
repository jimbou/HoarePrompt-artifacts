Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river grid. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river grid and a maximum distance `d` as input. It modifies the row by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing all other elements up to a specified index (`d-1`) by 2. Then, it iterates over the rest of the row, updating each element at index `i` to be the sum of its original value, the smallest element in a min heap that is not older than `i - (d + 2)`, and 1. The min heap contains tuples of elements from the row and their indices. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which is the sum of its original value, the smallest element in the min heap that is not older than the last index minus (`d + 2`), and 1.

`func_2` takes the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance as input, as well as the river grid. It calculates the costs of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores them in a list. Then, it calculates the minimum sum of subarrays of length `k` in the list of costs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. `func_1` correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row, and `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum sum of subarrays of length `k` in the list of costs. The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the input from the user and printing the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
