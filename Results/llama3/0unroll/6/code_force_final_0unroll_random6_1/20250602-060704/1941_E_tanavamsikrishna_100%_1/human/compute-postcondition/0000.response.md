Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river grid and each integer represents the depth of a cell. costs is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of calling func_1 on a row in rows with d as an argument. total_costs is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and d are updated based on the input provided. The rows variable is populated with a list of lists of non-negative integers, representing the river grid. The costs variable is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of calling the func_1 function on a row in rows with d as an argument. The total_costs variable is an empty list, indicating that it has not been populated with any values yet.
