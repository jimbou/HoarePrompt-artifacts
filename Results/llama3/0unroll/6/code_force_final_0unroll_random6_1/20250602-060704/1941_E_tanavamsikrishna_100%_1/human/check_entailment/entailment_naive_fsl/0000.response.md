Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic for installing supports. In the `func_1` function, the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. This line is trying to update the cost of installing a support at position `i` based on the minimum cost of the previous supports. However, it is adding 1 to the cost, which is not correct according to the problem description. The cost of installing a support at position `i` should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, where `a_{i,j}` is the depth of the cell at position `(i, j)`.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case when `d` is greater than the length of the row. In this case, the program will try to access elements outside the bounds of the row, which will result in an error.

A correct implementation of the `func_1` function would be:

```python
def func_1(row, d: int):
    min_cost = 0
    for i in range(len(row)):
        if i == 0 or i == len(row) - 1:
            min_cost += row[i] + 1
        elif i % d == 0:
            min_cost += row[i] + 1
    return min_cost
```

This function correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a given row and distance `d`. It iterates over the row and adds the cost of installing a support at each position that is a multiple of `d`, or at the first and last positions.
