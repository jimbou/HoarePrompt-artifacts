Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a greedy approach to find the minimum cost for each row and then calculates the total cost for each possible set of k consecutive rows.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum cost for a single row. It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 1, and then iteratively calculates the minimum cost for each subsequent element by considering the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements. The function uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost among the previous `d` elements.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input data, calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total cost for each possible set of k consecutive rows. The function prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

The program correctly implements the greedy approach to solve the problem. The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost among the previous `d` elements is found efficiently. The calculation of the total cost for each possible set of k consecutive rows in `func_2` is also correct.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In `func_1`, the line `row[0] = 1` modifies the original input row. This could potentially cause issues if the original input row is needed later in the program. It would be better to create a copy of the input row before modifying it.

Despite this small issue, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
