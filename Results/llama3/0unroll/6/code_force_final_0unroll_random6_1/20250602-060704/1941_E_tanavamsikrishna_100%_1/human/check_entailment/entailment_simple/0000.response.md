Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and a min-heap data structure to efficiently calculate the minimum cost.

The program first initializes the first element of each row to 1 and increments the subsequent elements up to index d-1 by 2. This is done to account for the cost of installing supports at the river banks and the initial supports.

The program then uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest element in the row that is not older than the current index minus (d + 2). This is done to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed d.

The program then iterates over the row, starting from index d, and updates each element by adding the value of the smallest element in the min-heap that is not older than the current index minus (d + 2), and 1. This is done to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for each cell in the row.

Finally, the program returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

The main function, func_2, reads the input data, calls func_1 for each row, and calculates the total cost for each subarray of length k in the costs list. It then prints the minimum total cost.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The use of a min-heap data structure ensures that the program efficiently calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each cell in the row. The program also correctly handles the boundary conditions and ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed d.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input data.
