    #State: Output State: The row list has been modified such that each element at index i (where i >= d) is the sum of the value at index i, the value of the smallest element in the min heap that is not older than i - (d + 2), and 1. The min heap contains tuples where the first element is an element from row[:d] or row[i] (where i >= d), and the second element is the index of that element in row.

    #The program returns the last element of the modified row list, which is the sum of the original value at the last index, the smallest element in the min heap that is not older than the last index minus (d + 2), and 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of non-negative integers and returns the last element of the modified list. It first sets the first element to 1 and increments all other elements up to a specified index (d-1) by 2. Then, it iterates over the rest of the list, updating each element at index i to be the sum of its original value, the smallest element in a min heap that is not older than i - (d + 2), and 1. The min heap contains tuples of elements from the list and their indices. The function returns the last element of the modified list, which is the sum of its original value, the smallest element in the min heap that is not older than the last index minus (d + 2), and 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row in the river grid and each integer represents the depth of a cell.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: The total_costs list is populated with the sum of each subarray of length k in the costs list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: minimum sum of subarray of length k in the costs list

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum sum of subarrays of length k in a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a separate function (func_1) based on the depth of cells in a river grid and a maximum distance between supports. The function takes as input the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance, as well as the river grid, and returns the minimum sum of subarrays of length k.
