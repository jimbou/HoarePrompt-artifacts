This function calculates the minimum sum of subarrays of length k in a list of costs, where each cost is determined by a separate function (func_1) based on the depth of cells in a river grid and a maximum distance between supports. The function takes as input the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance, as well as the river grid, and returns the minimum sum of subarrays of length k.
