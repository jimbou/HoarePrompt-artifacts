Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is an integer such that 0 <= xor < 2^30, `thing1` is the maximum value in `new_arr` at index `bit - 1`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers. The bit-th bit of xor is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `thing1` has been updated to the maximum value in the list `new_arr` at index `bit - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `new_arr` still being a list of non-negative integers, `xor` still being an integer between 0 and 2^30, `bit` still being an integer between 0 and 30, `x` still being a non-negative integer between 0 and 2^30, and `cur_arr` still being a list of non-negative integers. Additionally, the bit-th bit of `xor` is still 0.
