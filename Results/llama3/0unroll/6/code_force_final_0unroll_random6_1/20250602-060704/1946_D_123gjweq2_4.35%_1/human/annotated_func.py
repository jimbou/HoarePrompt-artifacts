#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` such that -1 <= bit < 30, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x < 2^30 as input. It returns either the number of non-negative integers in `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the maximum value in `cur_arr` at index `bit - 1` and the length of a newly created list `new_arr`, or either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` at index `bit - 1`. The function performs bitwise operations on the input integers, creates a new list `new_arr` based on these operations, and calculates maximum values at specific indices.
