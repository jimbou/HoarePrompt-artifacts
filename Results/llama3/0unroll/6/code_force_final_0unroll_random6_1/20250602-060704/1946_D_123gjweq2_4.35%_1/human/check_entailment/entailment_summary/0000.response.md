Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in an array such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number x. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`.

`func_1` simply calls `find_max` with the input array and the value 31.

`find_max` is a recursive function that takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit`, and a non-negative integer `x` as input. It performs bitwise operations on the input integers, creates a new list `new_arr` based on these operations, and calculates maximum values at specific indices.

The key insight here is that the function `find_max` is designed to work with the bitwise representation of the numbers in the array. The `bit` parameter is used to iterate over the bits of the numbers from most significant to least significant.

The function works as follows:

1. If `bit` is -1, it means that all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the current array.
2. Otherwise, it creates a new array `new_arr` by iterating over the current array and performing bitwise XOR operations. It also keeps track of the XOR of the current segment.
3. If the XOR of the current segment has a 1 in the current bit position, it means that the segment cannot be extended further, and the function recursively calls itself with the new array and the next bit position.
4. If the XOR of the current segment does not have a 1 in the current bit position, it means that the segment can be extended further, and the function returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the new array at the next bit position and the length of the new array.

The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the input array and the value 31, which means that the function will iterate over all bits of the numbers in the array.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that the functions are correctly implemented, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
