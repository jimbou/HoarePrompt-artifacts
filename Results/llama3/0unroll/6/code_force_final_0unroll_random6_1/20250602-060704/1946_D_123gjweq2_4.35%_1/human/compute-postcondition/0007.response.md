thing1 is assigned the value -1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is an integer such that 0 <= xor < 2^30, thing1 is -1, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers. The current value of the bit of xor at position bit is 1.
