Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The `find_max` function recursively checks each bit of the XOR of the subarrays and splits the array into subarrays whenever the bit is 0. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the XOR of the subarrays is less than or equal to `x`. The `func_1` function simply calls `find_max` with the initial array and the most significant bit.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `x` is 0 or the array is empty. The recursive approach ensures that all possible subarrays are considered, and the bitwise operations are performed correctly.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
