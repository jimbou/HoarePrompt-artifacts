The code initializes three new variables: `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1`. The first line creates an empty list called `new_arr`. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `xor`. The third line assigns the value of 0 to `thing1`. No other variables are affected. The initial state of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0, thing1 is 0**
