Postcondition: ***new_arr is a list of non-negative integers, xor is an integer such that 0 <= xor < 2^30, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers. If the bit-th bit of xor is 1, thing1 is -1. If the bit-th bit of xor is 0, thing1 is the maximum value in new_arr at index bit - 1. The bit-th bit of x is 0***
