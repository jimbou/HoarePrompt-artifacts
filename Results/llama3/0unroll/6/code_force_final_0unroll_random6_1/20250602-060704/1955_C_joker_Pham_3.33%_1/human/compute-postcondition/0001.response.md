Output State: **l is the index of the first element in a that is not sunk, r is the index of the last element in a that is not sunk, sunks is the number of elements in a that are sunk, k is the remaining number of operations, a is the updated list of elements with some elements sunk.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `l` now points to the first element in the list `a` that has not been sunk, and the variable `r` points to the last element in the list `a` that has not been sunk. The variable `sunks` now holds the total number of elements in the list `a` that have been sunk. The variable `k` now holds the remaining number of operations that can be performed. The list `a` has been updated with some elements sunk, meaning their values have been reduced to 0.
