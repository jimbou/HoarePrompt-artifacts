#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n and n is the length of array.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: l is the index of the find element in the array if find exists in the array, otherwise l is equal to n.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of 'l + 1', where 'l' is equal to 'n' because the current value of 'l' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array. The second string is the value of 'array.index(find) + 1', which is the index of 'find' in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is the index of the find element in the array if find exists in the array, otherwise l is equal to n. l is equal to the index of the find element in the array, and 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a target integer 'find' in a list of distinct integers 'array' and returns a list containing two strings. If 'find' exists in the array, the function returns a list with the index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string and the value of 'l + 1' as the first string, where 'l' is the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array. If 'find' does not exist in the array, the function returns a list with the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array plus one as the first string and the actual index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string. In both cases, the function prints a value indicating whether 'find' exists in the array (0 if it exists, 1 if it does not).
