The code snippet assigns the length of the array to the variable n, and then initializes two pointers, l and r, to the start and end of the array, respectively.

Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, n is the length of array and is equal to the number of elements in array, l is 0, r is n - 1**
