This function searches for a target integer 'find' in a list of distinct integers 'array' and returns a list containing two strings. If 'find' exists in the array, the function returns a list with the index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string and the value of 'l + 1' as the first string, where 'l' is the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array. If 'find' does not exist in the array, the function returns a list with the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array plus one as the first string and the actual index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string. In both cases, the function prints a value indicating whether 'find' exists in the array (0 if it exists, 1 if it does not).
