Reasoning: 
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and its execution summary. The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the target integer 'find' in the list of distinct integers 'array'. If 'find' exists in the array, the function returns a list with the index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string and the value of 'l + 1' as the first string, where 'l' is the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array. If 'find' does not exist in the array, the function returns a list with the index where 'find' should be if it existed in the array plus one as the first string and the actual index of 'find' in the array plus one as the second string. In both cases, the function prints a value indicating whether 'find' exists in the array (0 if it exists, 1 if it does not). This matches the problem description, which requires the program to perform at most two operations to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x.

Correctness: **True**
