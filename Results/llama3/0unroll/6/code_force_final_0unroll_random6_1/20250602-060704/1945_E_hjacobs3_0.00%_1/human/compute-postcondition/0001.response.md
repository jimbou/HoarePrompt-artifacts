Output State: **l is the index of the find element in the array if find exists in the array, otherwise l is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable l will be equal to the index of the find element in the array if the find element exists in the array. If the find element does not exist in the array, the variable l will be equal to n, which is the length of the array.
