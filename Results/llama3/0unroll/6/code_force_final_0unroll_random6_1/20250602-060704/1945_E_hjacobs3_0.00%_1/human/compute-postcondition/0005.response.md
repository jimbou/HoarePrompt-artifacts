Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of 'l + 1', where 'l' is equal to 'n' because the current value of 'l' is not equal to the index of 'find' in the array. The second string is the value of 'array.index(find) + 1', which is the index of 'find' in the array plus one.**
