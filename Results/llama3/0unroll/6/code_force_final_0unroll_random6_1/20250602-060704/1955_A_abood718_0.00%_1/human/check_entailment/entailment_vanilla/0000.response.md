Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and uses a for loop to iterate over the number of test cases specified by the user.

3. Inside the loop, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input, representing the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

4. The program then checks three conditions:
   - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the promotion price (C), it calculates the minimum cost by multiplying the number of yogurts (A) by the price of one yogurt (B).
   - If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the minimum cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the promotion price (C) and dividing by 2.
   - If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the minimum cost by buying the maximum possible pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (X * C) and adding the price of one yogurt (B) for the remaining yogurt.

5. However, there is an error in the last condition. The program prints the value of X (the number of pairs of yogurts) instead of the calculated minimum cost. It should print the result of the expression `X * C + B`.

6. Therefore, the given program is incorrect due to the printing error in the last condition.

Correctness: **False**
