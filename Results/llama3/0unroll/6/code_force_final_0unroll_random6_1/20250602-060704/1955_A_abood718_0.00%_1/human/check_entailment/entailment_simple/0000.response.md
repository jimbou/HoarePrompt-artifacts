Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks the conditions to determine the minimum cost.

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it calculates the minimum cost as the price of n yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the minimum cost as the price of A/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (int(A * C / 2)).

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the minimum cost as the price of A//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price plus the price of one yogurt at the regular price (X * C + B), where X is A//2.

However, there is a logical error in the last condition. The program prints the value of X (A // 2) before printing the actual result (X * C + B). This is incorrect because the value of X is not the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
