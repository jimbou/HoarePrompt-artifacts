Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles. The program iterates through each test case, and for each case, it checks the conditions to determine the minimum cost.

The conditions are as follows:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the promotion price (C), it calculates the cost as A * B.
2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the cost as int(A * C / 2).
3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the cost as (A // 2) * C + B.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the third condition, it prints two values: A // 2 and (A // 2) * C + B, instead of just printing the calculated cost. This is incorrect because the problem requires printing the minimum cost, not the intermediate calculations.

Correctness: **False**
