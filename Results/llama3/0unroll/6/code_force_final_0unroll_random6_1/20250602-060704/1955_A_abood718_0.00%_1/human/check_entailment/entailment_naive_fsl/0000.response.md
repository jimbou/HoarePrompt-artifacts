Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts. In the case where A is odd and B * 2 >= C, the program prints the number of pairs of yogurts (X) and then prints X * C + B, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be X * C + B, but without printing X.

For example, if the input is "3 5 11", the program will print "1" and then "16", which is incorrect. The correct output should be "15".
