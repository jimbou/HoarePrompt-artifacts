Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program uses a simple yet effective approach to solve this problem.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program iterates through each test case, reading the values of n and k, followed by the array of integers.
2.  It initializes two variables, c and maxi, to keep track of the running sum and the maximum value encountered so far, respectively.
3.  The program then iterates through the array of integers. If it encounters a negative number that is greater in magnitude than the current running sum, it updates the maximum value and resets the running sum. Otherwise, it adds the current number to the running sum and updates the maximum value if necessary.
4.  After iterating through the entire array, the program calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This formula effectively calculates the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by inserting the sum of the subarray with the maximum sum (maxi) k times, while also considering the sum of the original array (sum(l)).
5.  Finally, the program prints the result for each test case.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
