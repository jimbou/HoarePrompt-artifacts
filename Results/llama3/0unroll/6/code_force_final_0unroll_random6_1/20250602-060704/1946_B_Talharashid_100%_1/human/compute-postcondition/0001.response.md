Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, each representing the result of the calculation (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 for each test case. The number of integers in the list is equal to the number of test cases. The value of each integer is the result of the calculation for the corresponding test case.**
