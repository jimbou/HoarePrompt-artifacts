The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a result for each test case by iterating through the integers, maintaining a running sum and maximum value, and then applies a formula involving the maximum value, the sum of the integers, and the value of k. The result is then printed to the console, with the output being a list of integers representing the results of the calculations for each test case.
