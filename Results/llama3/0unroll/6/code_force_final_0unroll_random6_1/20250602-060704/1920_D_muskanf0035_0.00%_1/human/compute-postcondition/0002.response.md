Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `result` will hold the output of the function `func_1` for the last iteration of the loop, and the variables `n`, `operations`, and `queries` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
