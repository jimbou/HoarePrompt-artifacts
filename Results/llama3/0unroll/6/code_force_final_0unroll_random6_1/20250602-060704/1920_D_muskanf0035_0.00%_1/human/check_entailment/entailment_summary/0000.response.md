Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty, and he performs a series of operations on it. The operations are either appending an integer `x` to the end of the array or appending `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. After all operations are performed, Jayden has `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the array.

Function `func_1` takes in the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It processes the operations to construct the array and then calculates the result for each query by finding the corresponding element in the array.

Function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

However, there is a logical error in `func_1`. When operation type 2 is encountered, the function duplicates the entire array, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, operation type 2 should append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array, not duplicate the entire array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
