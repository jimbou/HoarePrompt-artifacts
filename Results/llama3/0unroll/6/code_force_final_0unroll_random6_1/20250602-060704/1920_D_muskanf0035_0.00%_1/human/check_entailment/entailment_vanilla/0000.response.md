Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. It initializes an empty list `array` to simulate Jayden's array and another list `result` to store the answers to Jayden's queries.

2.  The function then iterates over each operation in the `operations` list. If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`. If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by duplicating its current elements.

3.  After processing all operations, the function iterates over each query in the `queries` list. For each query `k`, it calculates the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to find the corresponding element in the `array` and appends it to the `result` list.

4.  The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` with the provided input, and prints the result.

However, there are a couple of issues with the program:

*   The program does not handle the case where the size of the array exceeds `10^18` after performing all operations. In such cases, the program may run into memory issues or take a long time to process.

*   The program does not validate the input. For example, it does not check if the operation type is within the range \[1, 2] or if the query values are within the range \[1, `10^18`].

*   The program does not handle the case where the number of operations or queries exceeds `10^5`.

Considering these issues, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
