This function takes in three parameters: a non-negative integer n, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct an array, where operation type 1 appends the value to the array and operation type 2 duplicates the current array. Then, for each query, it calculates an index based on the query value and the length of the array, and appends the element at that index to the result list. The function returns the result list, leaving the input variables unchanged.
