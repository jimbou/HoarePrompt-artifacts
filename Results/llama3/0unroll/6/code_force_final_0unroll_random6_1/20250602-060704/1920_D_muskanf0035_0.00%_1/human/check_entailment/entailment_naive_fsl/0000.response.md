Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is larger than the length of the array. In the problem description, it is stated that the query index can be up to 10^18, but the program only checks if the index is within the length of the array. If the index is larger, the program will return incorrect results.

For example, if the operations are [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)] and the queries are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20], the program will return incorrect results for queries 14, 15, 16, and 20 because they are larger than the length of the array.

To fix this issue, the program needs to handle the case when the query index is larger than the length of the array by using modular arithmetic to find the correct index within the array.
