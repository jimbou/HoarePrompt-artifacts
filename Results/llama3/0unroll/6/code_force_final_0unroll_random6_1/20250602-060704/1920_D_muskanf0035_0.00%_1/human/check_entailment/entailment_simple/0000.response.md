Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. It initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries. It then iterates over the `operations` list. If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`. If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by repeating the existing elements. After processing all operations, it iterates over the `queries` list and calculates the index of the element in the `array` using the formula `(k - 1) % len(array)`. It appends the element at this index to the `result` list.

`func_2` reads the input from the user. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It reads the `operations` list and the `queries` list. It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In `func_1`, when the operation type is 2, the program extends the `array` by repeating the existing elements. However, it does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The problem states that Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a. The program should extend the `array` by repeating the existing elements x times, not just once.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
