Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty. There are `n` operations of two types that Jayden must perform in the given order. The first type of operation appends an integer `x` to the end of array `a`, and the second type of operation appends `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`. After performing all `n` operations, Jayden has `q` queries, and for each query, he wants to know the `k`-th element of array `a`.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct an array, where operation type 1 appends the value to the array and operation type 2 duplicates the current array. Then, for each query, it calculates an index based on the query value and the length of the array, and appends the element at that index to the result list. The function returns the result list, leaving the input variables unchanged.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user. It reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of operations, a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, a list of `n` operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of positive integer queries. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It correctly processes the operations to construct the array, and it correctly calculates the index for each query based on the query value and the length of the array. The program also handles the case where the query value is greater than the length of the array by using the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the array.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the problem description, it is stated that the size of the array after finishing all `n` operations is at most `10^18`. However, in the program, the array is extended by duplicating the current array, which can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the array. This can cause the program to run out of memory or take a very long time to execute for large inputs. To fix this issue, the program should be modified to use a more efficient data structure, such as a tree or a graph, to represent the array.

Correctness: **False**
