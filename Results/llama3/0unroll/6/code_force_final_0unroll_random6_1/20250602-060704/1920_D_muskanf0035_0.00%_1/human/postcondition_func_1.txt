The function `func_1` takes three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` lists of two integers `operations`, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It performs a series of operations based on the input and returns a result. The function's purpose is to process the input data and generate an output, which is then printed. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds the output of the function for the last iteration of the loop, and the variables `n`, `operations`, and `queries` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
