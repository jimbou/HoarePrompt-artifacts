Reasoning:

The problem can be solved by observing that the game is won by the player who can make the last move. This happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. If the sum is even, the game will end with both wallets being empty, and the player who made the last move will lose.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator `&`. If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `test` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` and printing the result.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
