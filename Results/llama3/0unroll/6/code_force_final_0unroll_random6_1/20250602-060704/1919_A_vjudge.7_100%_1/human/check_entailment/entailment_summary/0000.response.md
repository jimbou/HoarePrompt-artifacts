Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins.

The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the coins (a + b), and checks its parity using the bitwise AND operator (&). If the result is 0 (i.e., the sum is even), it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example cases.

Correctness: **True**
