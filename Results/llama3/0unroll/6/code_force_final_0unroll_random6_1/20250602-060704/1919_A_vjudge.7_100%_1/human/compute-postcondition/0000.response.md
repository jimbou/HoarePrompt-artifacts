The code `test = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a single integer t, and assigns it to the variable `test`. The value of t is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

The remaining lines of input in stdin, which contain two integers a and b each, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).**
