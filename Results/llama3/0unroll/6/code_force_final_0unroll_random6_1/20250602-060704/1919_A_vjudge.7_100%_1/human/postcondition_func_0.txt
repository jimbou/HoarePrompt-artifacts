This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer 'test' and each subsequent line contains two integers 'a' and 'b'. It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each pair of integers, depending on whether their sum is odd or even, respectively. The function prints 'test' number of lines and leaves the input unchanged.
