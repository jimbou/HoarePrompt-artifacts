Output State: **The output will be a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on whether the sum of the two integers in the corresponding line of input is odd or even. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the value of 'test'. The value of 'test' and the contents of stdin will remain unchanged.**
