Reasoning: 

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even. If the sum is even, the program prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this is that if the sum of the coins is even, Alice will always be the one to empty her wallet first, because she makes the first move. This means that Bob will always have at least one coin left in his wallet when it's his turn, so he can always make a valid move. On the other hand, if the sum of the coins is odd, Alice will not be the one to empty her wallet first, so she will have at least one coin left when it's her turn, and she can make a valid move.

Therefore, the program correctly determines who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
