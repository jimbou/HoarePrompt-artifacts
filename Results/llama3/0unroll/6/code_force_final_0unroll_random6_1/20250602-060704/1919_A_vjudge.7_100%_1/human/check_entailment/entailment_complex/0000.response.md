Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, and the other player wins.

The provided Python program uses a simple and elegant approach to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The program then checks whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (&).

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who makes the last move will always be the one with the even number of coins.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given examples. The use of the bitwise AND operator (&) is a clever way to check the parity of the sum without using explicit conditional statements.

Correctness: **True**
