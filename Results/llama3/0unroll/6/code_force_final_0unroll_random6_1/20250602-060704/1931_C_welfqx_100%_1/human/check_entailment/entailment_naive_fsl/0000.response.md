Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

6
1 2 3 4 5 1

The program will output 4, but the correct answer is 5. The program only checks for the maximum length of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of the array, but it does not consider the case where the maximum length of consecutive equal elements is in the middle of the array.

In this case, the maximum length of consecutive equal elements is 1 (the single 1 at the start and end of the array), but the program does not consider the case where the maximum length of consecutive equal elements is 5 (the entire array except for the first and last elements). Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check for the maximum length of consecutive equal elements in the entire array, not just from the start and end.
