Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n and a_i are still within their respective ranges.
