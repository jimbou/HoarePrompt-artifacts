This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of operations required to make each input list a palindrome. It accepts a series of integers representing the number of test cases, followed by each test case consisting of a list of integers. The function returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform each list into a palindrome, considering cases where the list is already a palindrome, contains only one element, or requires modifications. The output is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required for the corresponding input list.
