Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each representing the minimum number of operations required to make the corresponding input list a palindrome. If the input list is already a palindrome or contains only one element, the output will be 0. Otherwise, the output will be the difference between the length of the list and the maximum of the length of the longest prefix and suffix that are equal.**
