Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The issue lies in the way the program handles the price increase after purchasing tickets. The program increases the price of all tickets by the number of tickets purchased, but it does not correctly update the prices in the priority queue.

For example, consider the case where n = 3, m = 2, k = 4, and prices = [1, 2, 3]. The program will first purchase 2 tickets on the first day at a price of 1, increasing the price of all tickets by 2. However, the priority queue will still contain the original prices (1, 2, 3), not the updated prices (3, 4, 5). This will lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program needs to update the prices in the priority queue after each purchase, taking into account the price increase.
