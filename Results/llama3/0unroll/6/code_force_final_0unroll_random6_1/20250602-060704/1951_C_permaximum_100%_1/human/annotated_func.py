#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers.
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: tickets_bought is k, total_cost is the sum of the k smallest prices in prices multiplied by the number of tickets bought at each price, price_increase is the sum of the number of tickets bought at each price.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost which is the sum of the k smallest prices in prices multiplied by the number of tickets bought at each price.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying k tickets with increasing prices, where the price increase is determined by the number of tickets bought at each price, and returns the total cost as the sum of the k smallest prices in the input list multiplied by the number of tickets bought at each price.
