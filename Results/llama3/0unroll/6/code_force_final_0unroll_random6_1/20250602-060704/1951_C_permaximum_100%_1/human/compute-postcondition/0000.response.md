Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0**

The code creates a min-heap `pq` from the list of prices, where each element is a tuple containing a price and its index in the original list. The `heapify` function transforms the list into a min-heap, allowing for efficient extraction of the smallest price. The variables `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase` are initialized to 0, indicating that no tickets have been bought and no price increases have occurred. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged.
