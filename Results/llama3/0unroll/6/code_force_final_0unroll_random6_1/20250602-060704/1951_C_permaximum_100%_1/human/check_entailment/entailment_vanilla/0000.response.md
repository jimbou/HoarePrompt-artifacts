Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).
3.  It then reads the prices of tickets for each day and stores them in the `prices` list.
4.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the parameters n, m, k, and prices.
5.  Inside `func_1`, it creates a priority queue (pq) using the `heapq` module, where each element is a tuple containing the price and day of the ticket. The priority queue is initialized with the prices and their corresponding days.
6.  The program then enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets have been bought.
7.  In each iteration of the loop, it pops the ticket with the lowest price from the priority queue, adds the current price increase to the price, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day (tickets_to_buy). This is done to ensure that the maximum number of tickets (m) is not exceeded on any day.
8.  The program then updates the total cost by adding the product of the price and the number of tickets bought, increments the tickets_bought counter, and updates the price increase.
9.  Once all k tickets have been bought, the function returns the total cost.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the problem. It uses a priority queue to efficiently select the ticket with the lowest price on each day and updates the prices and total cost accordingly.
