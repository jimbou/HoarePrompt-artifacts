Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the smallest price per ticket for each day. The program iteratively buys the minimum of m tickets or the remaining tickets needed (k - tickets_bought) at the smallest price per ticket, updates the total cost, and increases the price per ticket for the remaining days by the number of tickets bought. This process is repeated until all k tickets are bought.

The program correctly implements the problem's constraints, including the limit on the number of tickets that can be bought per day (m) and the increase in price per ticket for the remaining days after buying tickets.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
