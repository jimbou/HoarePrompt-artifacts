Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets with increasing prices. The program uses a priority queue to keep track of the prices of the tickets, and it iteratively buys the cheapest tickets until it has bought k tickets.

However, the program has a logical error. The line `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` is incorrect. This line is intended to increase the price of the remaining tickets by the number of tickets bought at the current price. However, this is not the correct way to do it. The correct way is to increase the price of the remaining tickets by the number of tickets bought at the current price, but only for the remaining days.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        # Increase the price of the remaining tickets
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
            # Push the updated price back into the priority queue
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[i], i))
    return total_cost
```

Correctness: **False**
