Functionality: **This function calculates the total score of a permutation by traversing the permutation for a specified number of steps, accumulating the scores of the visited positions, and accounting for any cycles in the permutation. It takes as input a starting position, the number of steps, a permutation, and a list of scores, and returns the total score. If the permutation contains a cycle, the function calculates the score of the cycle and adds it to the total score, taking into account any remaining steps after the cycle is completed.**
