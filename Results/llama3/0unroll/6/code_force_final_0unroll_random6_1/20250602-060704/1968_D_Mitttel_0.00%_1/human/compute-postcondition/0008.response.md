Output State: The score is the sum of all elements in list a plus the product of the number of full cycles and the cycle score, plus the sum of the elements in the permutation at the positions visited in the last remainder_steps steps, steps is equal to k, visited is a dictionary where keys are the positions in the permutation and values are the steps at which these positions were visited, cycle_start is not -1, current_pos is the position in the permutation after k steps from the initial start_pos, cycle_length is 0, cycle_score is the sum of all elements in the cycle of the permutation, cycle_pos is the position in the permutation after k steps from the initial start_pos, remaining_steps is 0, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is 0.
