Functionality: **The function reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input data is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing the number of test cases, followed by lines containing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array. The function processes each test case by calling the func_1 function with the provided parameters and appends the result to the results list. Finally, it prints each result in the results list to the console.**
