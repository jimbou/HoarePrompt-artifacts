Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The program correctly calculates the scores of both players, Bodya and Sasha, by iterating through the permutation and adding the corresponding values from the array. The program also correctly handles the case where the game duration is longer than the length of the permutation, by calculating the score for the remaining steps after the permutation has been fully traversed.

The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the positions visited during the game, which allows it to detect cycles in the permutation and calculate the score accordingly. The program also correctly handles the case where the game duration is a multiple of the cycle length, by calculating the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
