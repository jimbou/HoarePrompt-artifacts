Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" and calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha. The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the case where the game lasts for k turns, and the `func_1` function correctly compares the scores and returns the winner.

The program also correctly handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (k), by using a cycle detection approach to avoid redundant calculations. This is done by keeping track of the visited positions and detecting when a cycle is formed. Once a cycle is detected, the program calculates the score for the remaining turns by using the cycle length and the remaining steps.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs and edge cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
