Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The score is the sum of all elements in list a plus the product of the number of full cycles and the cycle score, steps is equal to k, visited is a dictionary where keys are the positions in the permutation and values are the steps at which these positions were visited, cycle_start is not -1, current_pos is the position in the permutation after k steps from the initial start_pos, cycle_length is 0, cycle_score is the sum of all elements in the cycle of the permutation, cycle_pos is the position in the permutation after k steps from the initial start_pos, remaining_steps is 0, full_cycles is the integer division of k - steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is the remainder of the division of k - steps by cycle_length.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
