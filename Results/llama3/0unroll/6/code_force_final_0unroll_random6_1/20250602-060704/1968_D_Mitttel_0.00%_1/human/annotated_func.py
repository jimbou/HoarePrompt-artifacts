#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on their scores. It accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'). The function calculates the scores using the calculate_score function and compares them to determine the outcome. If Bodya's score is higher, it returns 'Bodya'. If Sasha's score is higher, it returns 'Sasha'. If the scores are equal, it returns 'Draw'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total score of a permutation by traversing the permutation for a specified number of steps, accumulating the scores of the visited positions, and accounting for any cycles in the permutation. It takes as input a starting position, the number of steps, a permutation, and a list of scores, and returns the total score. If the permutation contains a cycle, the function calculates the score of the cycle and adds it to the total score, taking into account any remaining steps after the cycle is completed.

The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the results list has been printed to the console. The values of t, index, data, n, k, PB, PS, p, and a remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input data is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing the number of test cases, followed by lines containing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array. The function processes each test case by calling the func_1 function with the provided parameters and appends the result to the results list. Finally, it prints each result in the results list to the console.
