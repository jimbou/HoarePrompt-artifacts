Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on their scores, which are calculated by traversing a permutation and accumulating scores from an array. The program consists of three functions: func_1, calculate_score, and func_2.

func_1 determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', which are calculated using the calculate_score function. The calculate_score function calculates the total score of a permutation by traversing the permutation for a specified number of steps, accumulating the scores of the visited positions, and accounting for any cycles in the permutation.

func_2 reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The input data is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing the number of test cases, followed by lines containing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The calculate_score function correctly calculates the total score of a permutation, taking into account any cycles in the permutation. The func_1 function correctly compares the scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' to determine the winner. The func_2 function correctly reads input data and prints the results to the console.

Correctness: **True**
