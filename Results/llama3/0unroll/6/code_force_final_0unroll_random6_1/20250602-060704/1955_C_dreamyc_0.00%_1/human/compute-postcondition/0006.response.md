Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers and two positive integers as input, and returns the maximum number of integers that can be reduced to zero by repeatedly subtracting the minimum of two integers from both integers, given a limited number of operations. The function modifies the input list by removing and adding integers, and returns the count of integers that were completely reduced to zero.**
