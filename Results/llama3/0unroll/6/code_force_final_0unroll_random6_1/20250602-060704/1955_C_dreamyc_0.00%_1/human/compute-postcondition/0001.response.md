Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is a positive integer.**

In this output state, the value of n remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The value of k is reduced by 2 * x in each iteration, where x is the minimum of the two numbers removed from the deque. The value of nums is also changed as numbers are removed and added back to the deque. The value of ans is increased by 1 for each number that is completely removed from the deque.
