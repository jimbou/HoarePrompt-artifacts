Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0**

The code converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue data structure. This means that `nums` can now be efficiently appended or popped from both ends. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, but its purpose is not clear from this code snippet alone. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
