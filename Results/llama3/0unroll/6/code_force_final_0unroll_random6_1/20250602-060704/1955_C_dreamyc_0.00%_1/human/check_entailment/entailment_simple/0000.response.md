Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and counts the number of ships sunk. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. It also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink a ship, and the case where only one ship is left.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of a deque is efficient, and the program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of ships. The program also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attack is not enough to sink a ship, and the case where only one ship is left.

Correctness: **True**
