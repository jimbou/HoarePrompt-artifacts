Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add elements from both ends of the list, simulating the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships.

2. The while loop continues until either the Kraken's attacks are exhausted (k becomes 0) or there is only one ship left (len(nums) < 2).

3. Inside the loop, the program calculates the minimum durability (x) that can be reduced from both the first and last ships. If the Kraken's attacks are sufficient to reduce both ships by x, it does so and updates the remaining attacks (k). If not, it breaks the loop.

4. After reducing the durability of both ships, the program checks if either ship has sunk (durability becomes 0). If a ship sinks, it increments the answer (ans) and removes the ship from the deque.

5. If there is only one ship left and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it, the program returns the answer plus one. Otherwise, it returns the answer.

6. The program handles the edge case where there is only one ship and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it.

7. The program correctly calculates the number of ships sunk by the Kraken's attacks.

Correctness: **True**
