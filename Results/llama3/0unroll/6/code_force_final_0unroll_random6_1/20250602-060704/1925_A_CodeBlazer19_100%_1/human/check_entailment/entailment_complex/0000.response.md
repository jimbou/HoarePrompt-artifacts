Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It generates a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program also ensures that the output string has the smallest length possible.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description. The use of the `*` operator to repeat the string is a clever and efficient way to generate the output.

Correctness: **True**
