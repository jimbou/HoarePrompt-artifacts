The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains two inputs: two positive integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The first input is assigned to `t`. 

Since `t` is assigned the first input which is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 26, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 26. The second input k is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 26, stdin contains one input: a positive integer k such that 1 <= k <= 26.**
