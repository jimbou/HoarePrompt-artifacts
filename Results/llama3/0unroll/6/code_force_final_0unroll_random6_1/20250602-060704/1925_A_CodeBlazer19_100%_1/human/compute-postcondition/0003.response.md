Functionality: **The function reads a series of pairs of positive integers (n, k) from standard input, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and prints the first k letters of the alphabet repeated n times for each pair. The function repeats this process for a number of iterations specified by an initial input t, resulting in a total output string of length n*k*t.**
