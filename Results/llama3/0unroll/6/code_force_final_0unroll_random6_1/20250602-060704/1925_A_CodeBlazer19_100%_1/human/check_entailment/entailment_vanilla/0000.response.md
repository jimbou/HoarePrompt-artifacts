Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
3. It then prints a string `s` that is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times, the program ensures that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using these alphabets will occur as a subsequence of `s`. This is because each alphabet will appear `n` times in `s`, allowing for all possible combinations of these alphabets to be formed.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program will print the string "abab". This string contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ("a" and "b"), namely "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb".

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
