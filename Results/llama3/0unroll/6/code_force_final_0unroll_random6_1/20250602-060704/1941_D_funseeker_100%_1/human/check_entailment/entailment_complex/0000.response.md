Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program reads input from standard input, processes the input, and prints the output.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. 

- func_1 reads a string from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
- func_2 converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_1 to an integer and returns it.
- func_3 takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It converts a string of space-separated integers returned by func_1 into a list of integers.
- func_4 generates a set of all possible values that a given positive integer x can take after a specified number of iterations m, where in each iteration, x is either incremented or decremented by a random value r modulo n. The function then prints the number of unique possible values and the sorted sequence of these values, excluding 0 and including n if 0 is present.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the case where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. It also correctly handles the case where the result of the throw is 0 by replacing it with n.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
