Output State: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n and m remains unchanged, but the value of x has been transformed into a set of all possible values that x can take after m iterations of the loop, where in each iteration, x is either incremented or decremented by a random value r (obtained from func_1()) modulo n.
