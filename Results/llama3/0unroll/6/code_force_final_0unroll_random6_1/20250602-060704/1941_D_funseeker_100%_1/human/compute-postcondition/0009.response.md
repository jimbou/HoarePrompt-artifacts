Output: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If 0 is in ans, then ans includes n but does not include 0. Otherwise, no additional information is available about ans, and the number of elements in the set ans is being printed. The elements of the set ans are being printed in ascending order.**
