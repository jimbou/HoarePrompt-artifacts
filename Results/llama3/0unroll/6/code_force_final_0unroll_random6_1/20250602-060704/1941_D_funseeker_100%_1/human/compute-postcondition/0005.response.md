Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If 0 is in ans, then ans includes n but does not include 0. Otherwise, no additional information is available about ans.***
