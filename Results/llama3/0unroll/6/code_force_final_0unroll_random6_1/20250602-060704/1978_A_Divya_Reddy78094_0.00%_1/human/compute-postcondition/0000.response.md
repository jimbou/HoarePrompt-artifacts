The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100), the value of `t` will be the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
