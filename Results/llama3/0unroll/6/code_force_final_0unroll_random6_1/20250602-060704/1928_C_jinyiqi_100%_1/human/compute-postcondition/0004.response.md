Output State: **The program returns a list of divisors of `x`, where the divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` are in reverse order, followed by the divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**

In this output state, the list contains all the divisors of `x`, but the order is specific. The divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` are in reverse order, meaning the smallest divisor is at the end of this part of the list, and the largest divisor (which is less than or equal to the square root of `x`) is at the beginning of this part of the list. The divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` follow this part of the list, in the order they were originally in `output2`.
