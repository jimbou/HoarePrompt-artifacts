Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even, and if so, it finds the factors of these numbers using the func_1 function. It then checks if the factors satisfy the condition (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x, and if so, it adds them to the output list. Finally, it removes duplicates from the output list and prints its length.

The func_1 function correctly finds the factors of a given number by iterating from 1 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by the current iteration. It then appends the factor and its corresponding quotient to the output list.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where n or x is 1. It also correctly handles cases where n and x are large numbers.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
