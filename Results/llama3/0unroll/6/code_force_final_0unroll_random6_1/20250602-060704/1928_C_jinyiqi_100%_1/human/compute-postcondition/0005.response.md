Functionality: **This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a list of divisors of the first integer in the input list, where divisors less than or equal to the square root are in reverse order, followed by divisors greater than or equal to the square root. The input list remains unchanged.**
