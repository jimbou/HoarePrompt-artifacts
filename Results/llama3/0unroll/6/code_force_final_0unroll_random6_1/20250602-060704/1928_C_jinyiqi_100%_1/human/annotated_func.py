#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, the second integer is greater than 1.

    #State: Output State: output1 is a list of divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x, output2 is a list of divisors of x that are greater than or equal to the square root of x, x is unchanged.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list of divisors of `x`, where the divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` are in reverse order, followed by the divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a list of divisors of the first integer in the input list, where divisors less than or equal to the square root are in reverse order, followed by divisors greater than or equal to the square root. The input list remains unchanged.
