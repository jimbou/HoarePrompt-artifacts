Output State: **nums is a sorted list of integers containing the integers from the input test cases and the integer 0, each decreased by the sum of the previous integers in the list, ls is the sum of all integers in nums, nw is True, cw is True.**

The output state is the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify the list `nums` or the variable `ls`. The loop only modifies the variables `nw` and `cw`, but their values are not used outside the loop, so they do not affect the overall state.
