Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the winner. The program assumes that the winner is determined by the parity of the sum of the differences between consecutive numbers in the sorted list of numbers. However, this is not a correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. If the GCD is 1, then Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the GCD represents the largest number that can be removed from each pile in a single move. If the GCD is 1, then Alice can always make a move, and Bob will eventually run out of moves. If the GCD is greater than 1, then Bob can always make a move, and Alice will eventually run out of moves.

For example, consider the input [2, 4, 6]. The program will output "Alice", but the correct output is "Bob". This is because the GCD of 2, 4, and 6 is 2, which means that Bob can always make a move, and Alice will eventually run out of moves.
