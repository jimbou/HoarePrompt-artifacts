Output State: **nums is a sorted list of integers containing the integers from the input test cases and the integer 0, each decreased by the sum of the previous integers in the list, ls is the sum of all integers in nums, nw is True, cw is True.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a boolean value to a variable. The first line sets `nw` to `True`, and the second line sets `cw` to `True`. These assignments do not affect the values of `nums` or `ls`, which remain unchanged from the initial state. The final state includes the original information about `nums` and `ls`, along with the new values of `nw` and `cw`.
