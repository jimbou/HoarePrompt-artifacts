Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains T lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `T` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains T lines, each containing two integers a and b, with the same constraints as before (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
