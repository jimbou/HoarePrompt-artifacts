Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. 

For example, when a = 3 and b = 5, the program will print 'Bob' because a % 2 == 1. However, according to the problem description, Alice will win this game. 

A correct solution would involve checking the sum of a and b. If the sum is even, Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This program correctly determines the winner of the game in all cases.
