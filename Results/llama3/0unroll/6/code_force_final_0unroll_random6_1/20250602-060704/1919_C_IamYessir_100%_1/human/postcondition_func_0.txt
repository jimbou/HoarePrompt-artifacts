This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then processes each list by distributing its elements into two separate lists, 'a' and 'b', based on certain conditions. The function counts the number of times an element in either list 'a' or 'b' is greater than its previous element and prints this count for each test case.
