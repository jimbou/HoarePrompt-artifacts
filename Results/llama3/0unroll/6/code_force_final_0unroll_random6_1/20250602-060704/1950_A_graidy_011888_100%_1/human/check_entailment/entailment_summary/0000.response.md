Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. The program correctly checks the conditions for a "STAIR" (a < b < c) and a "PEAK" (a < b and b > c). If either condition is true, it prints the corresponding classification.
4. If neither condition is true, the program correctly prints "NONE".
5. The program does not modify the input values and produces the correct output for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
