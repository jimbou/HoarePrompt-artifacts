The function reads an integer n from the standard input, followed by n sequences of three space-separated integers. It then classifies each sequence as 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the relative values of the integers and prints the classification for each sequence. The function does not modify the input values and produces a sequence of n lines as output, each containing one of the three classification strings.
