Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated n times.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated n times, as the first input (the integer) has been consumed by the `input()` function.
