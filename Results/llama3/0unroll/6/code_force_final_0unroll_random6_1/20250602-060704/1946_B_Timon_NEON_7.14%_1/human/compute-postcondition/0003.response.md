Output State: **new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the sum of all elements in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr and the ending index of that segment, and two additional sublists: one containing the maximum sum of all elements in arr, 0, and the last index of arr, and another containing 0, the last index of arr, max_sum is -1, arr is unchanged, and total_max_segment is a list containing -1.**

In this output state, the code has appended two new sublists to segments_variants. The first sublist contains the maximum sum of all elements in arr, 0, and the last index of arr. The second sublist contains 0, the last index of arr. The variable total_max_segment has been assigned a list containing -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
