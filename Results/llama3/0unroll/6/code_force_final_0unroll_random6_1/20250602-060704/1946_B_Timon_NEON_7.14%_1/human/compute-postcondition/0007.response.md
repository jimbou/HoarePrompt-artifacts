Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in `arr` and the ending index of that segment, and two additional sublists: one containing the maximum sum of all elements in `arr`, 0, and the last index of `arr`, and another containing 0, the last index of `arr`, `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is unchanged, and `total_max_segment` is a list containing only one element, which is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `total_max_segment`, which is now a list containing only one element, -1. The other variables retain their initial values, including `new_segment` being an empty list, `max_segment` containing the sum of all elements in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` containing various maximum sums and indices, `max_sum` being -1, and `arr` remaining unchanged.
