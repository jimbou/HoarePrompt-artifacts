You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:

    #State: Output State: new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the sum of all elements in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in arr and the ending index of that segment, max_sum is -1, arr is unchanged.

    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: *`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of a segment of consecutive non-negative numbers in `arr` and the ending index of that segment, and two additional sublists: one containing the maximum sum of all elements in `arr`, 0, and the last index of `arr`, and another containing 0, the last index of `arr`, `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is unchanged, and `total_max_segment` is a list containing either the maximum sum of all elements in `arr` and the last index of `arr` or only one element, which is -1.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all elements in `arr` and the last index of `arr`, or only one element, which is -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all elements in `arr` and the last index of `arr`, or only one element, which is -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
