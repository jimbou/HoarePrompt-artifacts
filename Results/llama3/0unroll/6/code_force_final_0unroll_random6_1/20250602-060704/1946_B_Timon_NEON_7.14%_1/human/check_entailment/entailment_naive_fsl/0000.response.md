Correctness: **False**.

The program is incomplete and does not provide a solution to the problem. The function `func_3` is not implemented, and the other functions do not seem to be related to the problem description.

The problem description requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program does not provide a solution to this problem.

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm could be used. The program would need to be completed to implement such an approach.

For example, a possible solution could involve iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray. The maximum sum would be updated at each step, and the final result would be the maximum sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

Without a complete implementation, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
