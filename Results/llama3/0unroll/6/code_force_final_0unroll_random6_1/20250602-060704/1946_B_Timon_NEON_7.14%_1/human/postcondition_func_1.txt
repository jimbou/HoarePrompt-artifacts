This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing either the maximum sum of all elements in the list and the last index of the list, or only one element, which is -1. The function identifies segments of consecutive non-negative numbers in the list, calculates their maximum sum, and keeps track of the maximum sum found so far. If no such segments are found, the function returns a list containing only -1. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
