Functionality: **The function takes a series of integers as input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, followed by t integers n. For each integer n, the function generates a list of n integers, where the list is constructed by alternating between two sequences: one starting from n and decreasing by 2, and the other starting from 1 + n % 2 and increasing by 2. The function then prints the generated list for each test case. The output is a series of lists, each corresponding to the input integer n, in the same order as the input.**
