This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the total size of the remaining components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree data structure. A good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size x. The function recursively traverses the subtree, counting good components and accumulating the size of remaining components.
