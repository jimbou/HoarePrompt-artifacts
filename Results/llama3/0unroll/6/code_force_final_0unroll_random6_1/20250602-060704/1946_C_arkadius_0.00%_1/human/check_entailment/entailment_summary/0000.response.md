Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

2. The program defines a Tree class and a TreeNode class to represent the tree and its nodes, respectively. The Tree class has methods to add edges and root the tree.

3. Function 1 (func_1) calculates the number of good components and the remaining size in a tree, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a given minimum size x. It traverses the tree in a post-order manner, aggregating the good components and remaining size from child nodes to their parents.

4. Function 2 (func_2) is a recursive version of Function 1, calculating the total number of good components and the total size of the remaining components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree data structure.

5. Function 3 (func_3) determines whether a given tree has a sufficient number of connected components of a minimum size. It returns True if the number of good components is greater than k, or if the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining vertices in the tree are sufficient to form another component of size at least x.

6. Function 4 (func_4) performs a binary search on a valid tree data structure with n vertices to find the smallest value of mid such that func_3(tree, n, k, mid) returns True.

7. Function 5 (func_5) constructs a tree from the given input, roots it at node 0, and then applies the func_4 function to the rooted tree, the number of nodes (n), and the value of k, printing the result.

The program correctly implements the required functionality by using a combination of tree traversal, recursive calculations, and binary search to find the maximum number x that satisfies the problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
