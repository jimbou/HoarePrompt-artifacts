This function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size in a tree, where a good component is a connected component with a size greater than or equal to a given minimum size x. It traverses the tree in a post-order manner, aggregating the good components and remaining size from child nodes to their parents. The function returns the total number of good components and the remaining size for the root node of the tree.
