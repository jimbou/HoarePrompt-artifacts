The code `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is a method call on the `tree` object, which suggests that it is a recursive function to root the tree. The method takes two parameters: `0` and `-1`. 

In the context of graph theory, a rooted tree is a tree data structure in which one node is designated as the root, and all edges are directed away from the root. The root of the tree is typically represented by a node with no incoming edges.

Given the initial state, the tree object has been populated with n-1 edges, where each edge connects two nodes u and v, and the values of n and k remain unchanged.

The method call `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` likely sets the root of the tree to the node with index 0, and the parent of the root node is set to -1, indicating that it has no parent.

After executing this code, the tree object has been rooted at node 0, and the values of n and k remain unchanged.

Output State: **The tree object has been rooted at node 0, the parent of the root node is -1, and the values of n and k remain unchanged.**
