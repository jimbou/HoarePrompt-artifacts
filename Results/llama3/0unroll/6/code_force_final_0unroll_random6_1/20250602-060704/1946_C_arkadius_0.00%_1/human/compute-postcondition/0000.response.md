Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a Tree object with n nodes, stdin contains n-1 lines of input, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree.**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new Tree object with n nodes and assigns it to the variable tree. The stdin remains unchanged as the code does not consume any input from it. The edges of the tree are still present in the stdin, waiting to be processed.
