This function performs a binary search on a valid tree data structure with n vertices to find the smallest value of mid such that func_3(tree, n, k, mid) returns True. It takes a tree, a positive integer n, and a non-negative integer k as input and returns the smallest mid value satisfying the condition. The function iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the smallest valid mid value, which is then returned as the result.
