Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search in Function 4. The line `mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2` should be `mid = (beg + end) // 2` to correctly calculate the middle index. This is because the `+ 1` can cause the `mid` to be out of the range of `beg` and `end` when `beg` and `end` are both even.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when `k` is 0. In this case, the program should return `n` as the maximum number of vertices in each connected component, but the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
