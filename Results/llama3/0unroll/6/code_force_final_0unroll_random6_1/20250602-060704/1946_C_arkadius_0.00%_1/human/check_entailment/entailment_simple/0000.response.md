Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the lower and upper bounds of the search range to 1 and n, respectively. Then, it iteratively checks the middle value of the range to see if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the middle value. If it is possible, the program updates the lower bound of the search range to the middle value. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound of the search range to the middle value minus 1.

The program uses a recursive function (func_1) to calculate the number of good components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex. A good component is a connected component of size at least x. The function returns the total number of good components in the subtree and the total size of the remaining components in the subtree.

The program also uses a function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function calls func_1 to calculate the number of good components in the subtree rooted at the root of the tree. If the number of good components is greater than k, the function returns True. If the number of good components is equal to k and the total size of the remaining components is greater than or equal to x, the function also returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program uses a function (func_4) to perform the binary search. This function iteratively calls func_3 to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the middle value of the search range. If it is possible, the function updates the lower bound of the search range to the middle value. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound of the search range to the middle value minus 1. The function returns the smallest value of the middle value for which it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the middle value.

The program uses a function (func_5) to read the input and call func_4 to find the maximum value of x. This function reads the number of vertices n and the number of edges k from the input, creates a tree object, and adds the edges to the tree object. Then, it calls func_4 to find the maximum value of x and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
