Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is the first input from the stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. The other variables are not affected by the code.
