Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It checks if the binary string can be rearranged into a valid binary number and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case accordingly. The function continues processing test cases until all inputs have been consumed, leaving the standard input empty.**
