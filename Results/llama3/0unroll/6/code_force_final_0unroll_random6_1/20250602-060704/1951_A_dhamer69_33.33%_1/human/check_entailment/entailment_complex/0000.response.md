Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the base case where `n == 2`. In this case, the only valid configuration is `'00'`, because there are no non-adjacent lamps to turn on. If the input is `'01'`, `'10'`, or `'11'`, the program correctly prints `'NO'`.
2.  For `n > 2`, the program checks if the number of `'1'`s in the string is even. If it's not, the program correctly prints `'NO'`, because it's impossible to turn on an odd number of lamps by choosing two non-adjacent lamps at a time.
3.  If the number of `'1'`s is even, the program checks if there is exactly one pair of adjacent `'1'`s in the string (i.e., `'11'`). If there is, the program correctly prints `'NO'`, because it's impossible to turn on these two lamps without turning on the lamp in between.
4.  If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints `'YES'`, indicating that it's possible to reach the desired configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
