You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer such that N = len(vals) and all elements in vals are greater than or equal to 2.
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: Output State: vals is a list of integers greater than or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and is the result of func_1 applied to the initial value of den and each element in vals, in order.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing and ends its execution, with the current value of den being an integer less than or equal to 0, and -1 printed.
    #State: *vals is a list of integers greater than or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is an integer greater than 0 and is the result of func_1 applied to the initial value of den and each element in vals, in order, vprod is a list of integers, where each element is the result of integer division of den by the corresponding element in vals, den is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the elements in vprod.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [den // vals[0]] [den // vals[1]] ... [den // vals[N-1]] (where den is the result of func_1 applied to the initial value of den and each element in vals, in order, and N is the number of elements in vals)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing and ends its execution, with the current value of den being an integer less than or equal to 0, and -1 printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
