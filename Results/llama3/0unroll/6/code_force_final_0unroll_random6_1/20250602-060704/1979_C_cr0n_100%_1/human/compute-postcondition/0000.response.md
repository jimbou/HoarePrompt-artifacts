The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer such that `N = len(vals)`, the value of `N` is the number of elements in `vals`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `vals`. Since all elements in `vals` are greater than or equal to 2, the list contains only integers greater than or equal to 2. Stdin is now empty so we don't include it in the output state. The third line assigns the first element of `vals` to `den`. Since all elements in `vals` are greater than or equal to 2, `den` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **vals is a list of integers greater than or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is an integer greater than or equal to 2**
