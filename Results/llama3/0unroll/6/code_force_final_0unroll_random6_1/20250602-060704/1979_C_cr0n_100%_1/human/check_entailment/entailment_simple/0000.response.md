Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` uses this LCM to determine the bets for each outcome.

In `func_2`, the program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (`den`) using `func_1`. Then, it calculates the product of `den` and the reciprocal of each multiplier (`vprod`). The program then checks if the difference between `den` and the sum of `vprod` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

If the difference is greater than 0, the program prints the elements of `vprod`, which represent the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
