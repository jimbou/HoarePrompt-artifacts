Output: **vals is a list of integers greater than or equal to 2, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and is the result of func_1 applied to the initial value of den and each element in vals, in order, vprod is a list of integers, where each element is the result of integer division of den by the corresponding element in vals, the current value of den is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the elements in vprod, and the current value of den is less than or equal to 0, and -1 is printed**
