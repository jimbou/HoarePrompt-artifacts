This function calculates the result of a custom operation (func_1) applied to the initial value of the first element in the input list (vals) and each subsequent element in the list, in order. It then uses this result to compute a list of integer divisions (vprod) and updates the result (den) by subtracting the sum of these divisions. If the updated result is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns without any output. Otherwise, it prints the list of integer divisions (vprod) and returns without any output.
