Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, calculates the LCM of all the multipliers, and then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier. It then checks if the sum of these products is less than the LCM. If it is, the function prints the products as the bets for each outcome. If not, it prints -1.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* The LCM of all the multipliers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. This means that if we bet the LCM on each outcome, we will receive back at least the LCM for each outcome.
* By calculating the product of the LCM and each multiplier, we are effectively scaling the LCM by each multiplier. This ensures that the amount we receive back for each outcome is at least the LCM.
* By checking if the sum of these products is less than the LCM, we are ensuring that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Based on this reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
