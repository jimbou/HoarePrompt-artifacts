Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the LCM of the multipliers using the `func_1` function, which uses the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`. Then, it calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and subtracts the sum of these products from the LCM to get the remaining amount of coins. If the remaining amount is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the products of the LCM and each multiplier, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, and the case where the multipliers are all different. It also correctly handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, in which case the program prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
