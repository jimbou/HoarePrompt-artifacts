The code prints a string containing the elements of the list `vprod`, separated by spaces. Each element in `vprod` is the result of integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. Since `den` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`, and `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`, the elements in `vprod` are the integer divisions of `den` by each element in `vals`.

Output: **[den // vals[0]] [den // vals[1]] ... [den // vals[N-1]] (where den is the result of func_1 applied to the initial value of den and each element in vals, in order, and N is the number of elements in vals)**
