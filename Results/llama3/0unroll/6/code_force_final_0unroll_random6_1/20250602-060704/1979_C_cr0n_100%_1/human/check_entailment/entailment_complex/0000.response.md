Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a player needs to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` uses this LCM to determine the distribution of coins among the outcomes.

In `func_2`, the program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (vals) using `func_1`. It then calculates the list of integer divisions (vprod) by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. The program then updates the LCM (den) by subtracting the sum of these divisions. If the updated LCM is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of integer divisions (vprod), which represents the distribution of coins among the outcomes.

The program's logic is correct, and it meets the problem description. The use of the LCM to determine the distribution of coins ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
