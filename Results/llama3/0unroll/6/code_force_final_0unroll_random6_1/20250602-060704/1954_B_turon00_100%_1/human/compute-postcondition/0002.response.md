Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers. The function calculates the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements of the input array. If the input array contains only one element or if all elements are the same, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
