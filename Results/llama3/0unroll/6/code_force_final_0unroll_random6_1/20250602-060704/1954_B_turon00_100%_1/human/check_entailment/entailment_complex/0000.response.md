Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Beautiful Array" problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the input array and keeping track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count (ans) if the current count is less than the minimum count. Finally, it checks if the minimum count is equal to the length of the array or if the array contains only one element. If either condition is true, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It correctly identifies when an array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements (i.e., when all elements are the same or when the array contains only one element). It also correctly calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
