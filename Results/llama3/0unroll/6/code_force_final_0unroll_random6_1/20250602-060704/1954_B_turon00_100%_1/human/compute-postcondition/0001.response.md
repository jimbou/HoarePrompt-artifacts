Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements of the input array. If the input array contains only one element or if all elements are the same, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements. The output is printed for each test case.**
