Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program iterates through the array and keeps track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element. 

If the array contains only one element or if all elements are the same, the program correctly prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

Otherwise, it prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
