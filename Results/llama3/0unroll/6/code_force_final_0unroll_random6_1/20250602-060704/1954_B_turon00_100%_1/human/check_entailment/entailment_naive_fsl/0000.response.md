Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only one distinct element, but the length of the array is greater than 1. In this case, the program will output the length of the array, which is incorrect. The correct output should be -1, because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 2

The program will output 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be -1.

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the input array contains only one distinct element. The program should check if the length of the array is greater than 1 and if all elements are the same, and if so, output -1.
