Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, reads the input array, and then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements.

The program uses a variable `tmp` to store the first element of the array, and a variable `cnt` to count the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp`. The variable `ans` is used to store the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array contains only one element or where all elements are the same, in which case it outputs -1.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements by iterating through the array and updating the `ans` variable whenever it finds a shorter subarray.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
