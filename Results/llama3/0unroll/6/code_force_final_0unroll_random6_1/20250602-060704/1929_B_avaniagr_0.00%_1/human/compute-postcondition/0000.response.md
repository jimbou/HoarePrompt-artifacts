Output State: **The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a given test case. The calculation is based on the values of n and k, and the output will be the sum of the products of k // 2 + k % 2 and a boolean value indicating whether k is less than 4 * n - 3, plus the product of 2 * n and a boolean value indicating whether k is greater than or equal to 4 * n - 3, plus a boolean value indicating whether k is equal to 4 * n - 2.**
