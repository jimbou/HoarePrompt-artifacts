Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the input data to form pairs of identical numbers and single numbers based on their occurrence in the first half of the input list. The number of pairs is determined by the value of k, and the remaining value of k is used to determine the number of single numbers. The function prints the pairs and single numbers for each test case, with the pairs consisting of two identical numbers and the single numbers being the remaining numbers that appear only once in the first half of the input list.**
