Output State: **The output state is a series of pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of two identical numbers, followed by a series of single numbers. The pairs are formed by selecting numbers that appear twice in the first half of the input list, and the single numbers are formed by selecting numbers that appear only once in the first half of the input list. The number of pairs is determined by the value of k, and the number of single numbers is determined by the remaining value of k after forming the pairs. The output is repeated for each test case.**
