stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) â€” the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains 2 integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
