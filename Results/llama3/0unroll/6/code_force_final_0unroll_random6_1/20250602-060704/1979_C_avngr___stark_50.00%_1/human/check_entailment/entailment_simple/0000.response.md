Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the product of all the multipliers. This is because the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers.

2. Then, for each multiplier, the program calculates the amount of coins that should be bet on that outcome. This is done by dividing the LCM by the multiplier. This ensures that the amount of coins received back for each outcome is a multiple of the LCM.

3. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the amounts of coins calculated in the previous step. This is done using the `func_1` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but is described in the comments.

4. The program then divides each amount of coins by the GCD. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

5. Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program prints out the amounts of coins to be bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount of coins received back for each outcome, which is the condition for coming out ahead in the game. The use of the LCM and GCD ensures that the amounts of coins bet are minimized, which is the optimal strategy for the game.
