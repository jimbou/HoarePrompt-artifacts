Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet amount for each outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM, and if so, prints the bet amounts. If not, it prints -1.

The program uses the `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bet amounts, and then divides each bet amount by the GCD to minimize the bet amounts while still satisfying the condition that the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM.

The program handles all potential cases, including the case where the sum of the bet amounts is not less than the LCM, in which case it prints -1. It also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, in which case the LCM is equal to the multiplier and the bet amounts are all 1.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
