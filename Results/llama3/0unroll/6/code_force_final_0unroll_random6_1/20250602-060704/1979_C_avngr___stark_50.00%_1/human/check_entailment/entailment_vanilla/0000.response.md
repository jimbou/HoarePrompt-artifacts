Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i` and stores it in the variable `m`. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.

4. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM `m` by each multiplier `k_i`. This is stored in the list `c`.

5. The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts in the list `c` using the function `func_1`. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

6. It then divides each amount in the list `c` by the HCF to get the minimum amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

7. The program checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM `m` divided by the HCF. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

8. If the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the HCF, it prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum amount of coins to bet on each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. It also handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Correctness: **True**
