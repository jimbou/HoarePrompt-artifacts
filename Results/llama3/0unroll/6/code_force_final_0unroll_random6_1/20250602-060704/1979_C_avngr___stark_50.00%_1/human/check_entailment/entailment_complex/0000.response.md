Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input and calculates the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the bet as the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets and divides each bet by the GCD to minimize the total amount of coins bet. If the total amount of coins bet is still greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it outputs the bets for each outcome.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the GCD of a list of numbers. This function iterates over the list of numbers and calculates the GCD of the current GCD and the next number in the list.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
