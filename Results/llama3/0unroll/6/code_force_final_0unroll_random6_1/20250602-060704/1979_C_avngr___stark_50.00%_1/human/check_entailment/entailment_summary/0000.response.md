Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if any outcome turns out to be winning. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the LCM divided by each multiplier, which represents the minimum amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome to satisfy the condition.

The program then checks if the sum of the minimum amounts of coins to be bet on all outcomes is less than the total amount of coins that would be received back. If it is, the program prints the minimum amounts of coins to be bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly calculates the GCD of the list of integers representing the multipliers, which is used to determine the minimum amounts of coins to be bet on each outcome.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
