This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought. The second line contains the price per ticket for each of the upcoming days. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets, considering the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day, and prints the calculated cost. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
