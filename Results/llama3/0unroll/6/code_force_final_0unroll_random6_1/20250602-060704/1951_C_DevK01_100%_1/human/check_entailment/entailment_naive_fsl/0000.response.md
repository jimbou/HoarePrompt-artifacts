Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the cost of purchasing tickets.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. However, in the program, the cost is calculated as if the price increase only affects the current day, not the subsequent days.

For example, in the first test case, the program calculates the cost of purchasing 1 ticket on the third day as 4, and then the cost of purchasing 2 tickets on the fourth day as 6. However, the correct calculation should take into account the price increase caused by purchasing 1 ticket on the third day, which would make the price on the fourth day 3 + 1 = 4, not 2.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, and it does not work correctly for all potential cases.
