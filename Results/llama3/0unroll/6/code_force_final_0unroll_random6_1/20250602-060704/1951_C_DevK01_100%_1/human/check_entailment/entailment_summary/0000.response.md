Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets, considering the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought.
2.  It sorts the prices of the tickets in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum cost.
3.  It calculates the number of days required to buy the specified number of tickets, considering the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.
4.  It correctly calculates the cost of buying the tickets on each day, taking into account the increase in price due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.
5.  It handles the case where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.
6.  It prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy the specified number of tickets, considering the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.

Correctness: **True**
