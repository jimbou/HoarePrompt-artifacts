Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 10^4. In each iteration, it will read two lines of input from stdin, process the input, and print the calculated cost. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will continue executing any remaining code. The state of variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.**
