Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (`m`), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (`k`).
2.  It correctly sorts the prices per ticket for each day in ascending order, which is necessary for finding the minimum spending.
3.  The program calculates the minimum number of days (`q`) required to buy `k` tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (`m`).
4.  It then calculates the cost of buying `k` tickets by considering two cases:

    *   If `n * m == k`, it means that we can buy all `k` tickets in `n` days, and the cost is calculated accordingly.
    *   If `n * m != k`, it means that we need to buy some tickets on the last day, and the cost is calculated by considering the remaining tickets to be bought (`mu`) and the increased prices due to previous purchases.
5.  The program correctly handles the case where `n * m != k` by popping the last element from the sorted prices list (`N`) and calculating the cost accordingly.
6.  Finally, the program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets, considering the constraints and rules provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
