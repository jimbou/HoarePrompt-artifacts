Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less than before.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but with one line less than before, since the first line has been read and assigned to `t`. The rest of the test cases remain unchanged, with each test case still containing two lines: the first line with three integers n, m, and k, and the second line with n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n.
