stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(nm, 10^9)) — the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
