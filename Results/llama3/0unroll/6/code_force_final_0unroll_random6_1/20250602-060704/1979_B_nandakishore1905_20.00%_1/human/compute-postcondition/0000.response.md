Output State: **The output state will contain the results of the given operations for each test case. For each test case, if the absolute difference between the two input numbers is a power of 2, the output will be the absolute difference. If the first number is 0 and the second number is odd, the output will be 1. If the first number is 0 and the second number is even, the output will be 2. For all other cases, the output will be the absolute difference minus the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the absolute difference.**
