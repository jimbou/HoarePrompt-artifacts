Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two space-separated integers. It calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and then applies specific rules to determine the output for each test case. If the absolute difference is a power of 2, it outputs the difference. If the first number is 0 and the second number is odd, it outputs 1. If the first number is 0 and the second number is even, it outputs 2. For all other cases, it outputs the absolute difference minus the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the absolute difference. The function prints the results for each test case.**
