Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints either 2 or 3. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given set of distinct integers satisfies a specific condition. If the condition is met, it prints 2 and terminates early. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function's final state is that it has processed one test case from stdin and printed a result, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin unchanged.**
