Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend the party. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found after checking all friends, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program's logic is correct because it covers all possible scenarios:

1.  If there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, sending invitations to these two friends is sufficient to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.
2.  If no such pair exists, it means that each friend's best friend is someone else, and therefore, sending invitations to at least three friends is necessary to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

The program's implementation is also correct, as it accurately reflects the problem's requirements and constraints. The use of a loop to iterate through each test case and the conditional statement to check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends are appropriate.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
