Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1()` that reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends' indices `v`.

3. The program then checks for each friend `i` if their best friend `v[i]` has `i` as their best friend. If such a pair is found, it means that inviting these two friends will result in at least two friends coming to the party. In this case, the program prints `2` and returns.

4. If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it means that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints `3`.

The program's logic is correct because it covers all possible scenarios:

- If there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, inviting them will result in at least two friends coming to the party.
- If no such pair exists, inviting at least three friends will ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send.

Correctness: **True**
