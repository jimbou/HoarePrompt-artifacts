Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program first checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because sending invitations to these two friends will result in both of them coming to the party.

If no such pair is found, it prints 3, because in this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two of them come to the party.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If there are pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, it prints 2.
* If there are no such pairs, it prints 3.

The program does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, it is correct.
