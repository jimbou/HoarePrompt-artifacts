Output: **The loop will either print 2 and terminate early, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything. In the latter case, the state of the variables will remain unchanged, i.e., n will still be an integer between 1 and 5000, and v will still be a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are distinct integers between 1 and n. The stdin will still contain t-1 test cases, and the number 3 is being printed**
