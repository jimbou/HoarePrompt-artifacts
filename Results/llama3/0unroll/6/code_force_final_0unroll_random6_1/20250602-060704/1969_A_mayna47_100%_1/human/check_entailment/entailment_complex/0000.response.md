Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party. The program iterates through the list of friends and checks if the best friend of each friend is also a friend of the current friend. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2 and terminates early. If no such pair is found after iterating through the entire list, the program prints 3.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the condition that a friend comes to the party only if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation. By checking for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program is effectively finding the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program's handling of the input and output is also correct. It reads the number of test cases, the number of friends, and the list of friends' best friends from the standard input, and prints the result to the standard output.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
