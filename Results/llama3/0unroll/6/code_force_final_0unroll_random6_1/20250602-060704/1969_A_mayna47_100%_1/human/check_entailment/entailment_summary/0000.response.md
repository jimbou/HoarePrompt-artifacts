Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friend relationships `p_i`.

The program then checks if there exists a pair of friends `i` and `p_i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that `i` and `p_i` are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and returns, as Monocarp can send invitations to both `i` and `p_i` and have at least 2 friends attend the party.

If no such pair is found, it prints 3, as Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
