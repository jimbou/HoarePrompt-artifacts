Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop will either print 2 and terminate early, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything. In the latter case, the state of the variables will remain unchanged, i.e., n will still be an integer between 1 and 5000, and v will still be a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are distinct integers between 1 and n. The stdin will still contain t-1 test cases.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints either 2 or 3. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given set of distinct integers satisfies a specific condition. If the condition is met, it prints 2 and terminates early. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function's final state is that it has processed one test case from stdin and printed a result, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin unchanged.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
