    #State: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a non-negative integer, `inx` is the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, otherwise `inx` is -1. Either `x` is not in `a` or `x` is in `a` but the first occurrence of `x` in `a` is not at index `inx`

    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, otherwise it returns -1. However, it is guaranteed that either `x` is not in `a` or the first occurrence of `x` in `a` is not at index `inx`, so the returned value is either -1 or not the actual first occurrence of `x` in `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for the first occurrence of a non-negative integer `x` in a list of non-negative integers `a` and returns the index plus 1 if found, or -1 if not found or if `x` is negative.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and its length as input, and returns a list containing the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the input list to make it a non-decreasing sequence. The function achieves this by first computing the prefix sums of the input list and the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in the list. Then, it iterates through the input list, comparing each element with its previous one. If an element is smaller than its previous one, the function sets the corresponding value in the output list to 1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the subsequence non-decreasing by finding the maximum of the prefix sum minus the current element minus 1 and the index of the last occurrence of the previous element. The function returns the output list, which contains the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the input list to make it a non-decreasing sequence.
