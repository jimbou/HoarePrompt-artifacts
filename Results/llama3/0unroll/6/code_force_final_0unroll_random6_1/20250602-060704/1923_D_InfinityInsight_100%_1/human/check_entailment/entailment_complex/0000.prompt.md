Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers and x is a non-negative integer.
    if (x < 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, which is an integer.
    #State: *a is a list of non-negative integers and x is a non-negative integer

        return inx + 1
        #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` plus 1, or 0 if `x` is not in `a`.
    #State: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a non-negative integer, `inx` is the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, otherwise `inx` is -1. Either `x` is not in `a` or `x` is in `a` but the first occurrence of `x` in `a` is not at index `inx`
    return inx
    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` if `x` is in `a`, otherwise it returns -1. However, it is guaranteed that either `x` is not in `a` or the first occurrence of `x` in `a` is not at index `inx`, so the returned value is either -1 or not the actual first occurrence of `x` in `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for the first occurrence of a non-negative integer `x` in a list of non-negative integers `a` and returns the index plus 1 if found, or -1 if not found or if `x` is negative.

    #State: Output State: The list 'left' now contains the prefix sums of the list 'a'. The list 'a' remains unchanged.
    for i in range(1, n):

    #State: Output State: The list 'ans' now contains the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list 'a' to make it a non-decreasing sequence. The lists 'left' and 'a' remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list 'ans' which contains the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list 'a' to make it a non-decreasing sequence.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and its length as input, and returns a list containing the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the input list to make it a non-decreasing sequence. The function achieves this by first computing the prefix sums of the input list and the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in the list. Then, it iterates through the input list, comparing each element with its previous one. If an element is smaller than its previous one, the function sets the corresponding value in the output list to 1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the subsequence non-decreasing by finding the maximum of the prefix sum minus the current element minus 1 and the index of the last occurrence of the previous element. The function returns the output list, which contains the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the input list to make it a non-decreasing sequence.
