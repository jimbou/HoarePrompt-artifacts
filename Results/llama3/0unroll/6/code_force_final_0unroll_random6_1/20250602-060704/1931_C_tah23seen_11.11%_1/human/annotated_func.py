    #The program returns the difference between the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array is the last index of the array, and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array is less than or equal to the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest substring with mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, or 0 if the array is a palindrome. It compares elements from both ends of the array, moving towards the center, and returns the difference between the indices of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, or the length of the substring with mismatched elements if the end index is not the last index of the array. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0.
