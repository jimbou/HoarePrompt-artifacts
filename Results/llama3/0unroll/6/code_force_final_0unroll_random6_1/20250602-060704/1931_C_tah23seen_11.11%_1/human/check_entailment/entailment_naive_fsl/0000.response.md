Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. The program will return 4, but the correct answer is 5. The program only checks if the first and last elements are equal, and if they are not, it returns the difference between the indices of the first and last elements. However, this approach does not consider the case where the array can be made equal by assigning a value to a subarray that is not at the beginning or end of the array.

For instance, in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], we can make all elements equal by assigning the value 1 to the subarray [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which would result in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The program does not consider this case and returns an incorrect answer.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
