Output State: i is the index of the first mismatched pair of elements from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched pair of elements from the end of arr, arr remains unchanged.

In this output state, the loop has iterated through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, the loop increments i and decrements j, effectively moving towards the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched pair of elements. The array itself remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
