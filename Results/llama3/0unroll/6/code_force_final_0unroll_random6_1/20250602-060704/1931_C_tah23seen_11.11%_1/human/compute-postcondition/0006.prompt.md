Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j
Code of the loop:
while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
