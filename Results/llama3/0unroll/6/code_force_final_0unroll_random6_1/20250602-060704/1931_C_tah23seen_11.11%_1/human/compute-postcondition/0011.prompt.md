You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr.
    #
    #In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: *i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the length of the longest substring with mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, which is equal to j - i + 1, where j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array and i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The value of j is not equal to the last index of the array, and i is less than or equal to j.
    #State: *i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j. j is equal to the last index of the array
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array is the last index of the array, and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array is less than or equal to the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the length of the longest substring with mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, which is equal to j - i + 1, where j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array and i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The value of j is not equal to the last index of the array, and i is less than or equal to j.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array. The index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array is the last index of the array, and the index of the first mismatched element from the start of the array is less than or equal to the index of the first mismatched element from the end of the array.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
