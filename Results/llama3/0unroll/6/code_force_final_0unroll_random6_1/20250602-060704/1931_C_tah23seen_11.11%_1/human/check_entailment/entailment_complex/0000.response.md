Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (operations) needed to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a two-pointer approach, comparing elements from both ends of the array and moving towards the center. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center. If the elements do not match, it breaks the loop and returns the difference between the indices of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, or the length of the substring with mismatched elements if the end index is not the last index of the array.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code. It is called in the main loop, but its implementation is not provided.
2. The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element. In this case, the function should return 0, as no operations are needed to make all elements equal.
3. The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted. In this case, the function should return 0, as no operations are needed to make all elements equal.

Despite these issues, the overall approach of the program is correct. It uses a two-pointer approach to compare elements from both ends of the array and moves towards the center, which is an efficient way to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

Correctness: **False**
