Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (operations) needed to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by comparing elements from both ends of the array, moving towards the center. If the elements at the current indices `i` and `j` are equal, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. If the elements are not equal, it breaks the loop.

After the loop, if `i` is greater than `j`, it means that the array is a palindrome (all elements are equal), and the function returns 0.

If the array is not a palindrome, the function checks if the end index `j` is not the last index of the array. If it's not, it returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, which represents the length of the substring with mismatched elements.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The function only checks if the array is a palindrome or not, and if not, it returns the length of the substring with mismatched elements. But it does not consider the cost of the operation, which is `(j - i + 1)` burles.

Moreover, the function does not handle the case where the array has multiple substrings with mismatched elements. In such cases, the function should return the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal, which is not necessarily the length of the substring with mismatched elements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
