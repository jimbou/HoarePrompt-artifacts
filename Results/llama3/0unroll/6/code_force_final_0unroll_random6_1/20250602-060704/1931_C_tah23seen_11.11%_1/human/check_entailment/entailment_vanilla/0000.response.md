Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the array is already sorted in a specific way, and if not, it tries to find the minimum number of burles (operations) needed to make all elements equal.

However, the program has several issues:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It tries to find the first pair of elements from the start and end of the array that are equal, and then checks if the rest of the array is already sorted. However, this approach is not correct because it doesn't consider all possible cases.

2. The program doesn't correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed. It only checks if the array is already sorted in a specific way, but it doesn't consider the case where the array needs to be modified to make all elements equal.

3. The program doesn't handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. In this case, the function `func_1` will return 0, which is correct, but the program doesn't explicitly handle this case.

4. The program doesn't handle the case where the array is already sorted correctly. In this case, the function `func_1` will return 0, which is correct, but the program doesn't explicitly handle this case.

5. The program doesn't handle the case where the array needs to be modified to make all elements equal correctly. In this case, the function `func_1` will return an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
