Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest substring with mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, or 0 if the array is a palindrome. It compares elements from both ends of the array, moving towards the center, and returns the difference between the indices of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, or the length of the substring with mismatched elements if the end index is not the last index of the array. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0.**
