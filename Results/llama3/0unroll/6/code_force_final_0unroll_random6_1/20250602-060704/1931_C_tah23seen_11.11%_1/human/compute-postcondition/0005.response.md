Postcondition: ***i is the index of the first mismatched element from the start of arr, j is the index of the first mismatched element from the end of arr. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop iterates through the array from both ends, comparing elements at the current positions of i and j. If the elements match, it moves the pointers closer to the center of the array. If the elements do not match, the loop breaks, leaving i and j at the positions of the first mismatched elements from the start and end of the array, respectively. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j***
