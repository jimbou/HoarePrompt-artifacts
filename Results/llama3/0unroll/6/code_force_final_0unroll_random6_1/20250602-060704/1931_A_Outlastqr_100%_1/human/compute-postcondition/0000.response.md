Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers n (3 <= n <= 78).**

In this output state, the variable `alphabet` is assigned the string of all lowercase English letters, which is a constant value. The stdin still contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), as the code does not affect the input.
