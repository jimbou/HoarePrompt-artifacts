Output State: The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the input integer t. In each iteration, it will print a string of three characters. The first character will be 'a' if n is less than or equal to 27, 'a' followed by the nth letter of the alphabet if n is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet if n is greater than 52. The second character will always be 'a'. The third character will be 'y' if n is 27, 'z' if n is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or 'z' followed by the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet if n is greater than 52. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.
