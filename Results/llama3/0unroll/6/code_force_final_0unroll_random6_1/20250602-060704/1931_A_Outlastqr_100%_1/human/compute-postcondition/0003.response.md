Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers n. For each n, it constructs and prints a three-character string based on the value of n, using a combination of lowercase English letters from the alphabet. The function executes t times, printing a total of t strings, and leaves the standard input empty after reading all inputs.**
