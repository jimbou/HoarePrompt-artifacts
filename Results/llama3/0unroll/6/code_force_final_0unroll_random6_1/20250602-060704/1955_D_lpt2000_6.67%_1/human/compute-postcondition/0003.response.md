Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers (n, m, and k), the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains m integers. It then processes each test case by maintaining a count of common elements between the two sets of integers and updates this count as it slides a window of size m over the first set of integers. The function outputs the total number of times the count of common elements is greater than or equal to k for each test case.**
