Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The second line contains m space-separated integers (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, `nabors` is assigned the value of the first line of the first test case, which contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains n space-separated integers, and the second line contains m space-separated integers.
