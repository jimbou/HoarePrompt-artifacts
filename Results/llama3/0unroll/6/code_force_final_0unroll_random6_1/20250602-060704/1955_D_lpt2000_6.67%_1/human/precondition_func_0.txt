stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m space-separated integers (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).
