Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `fnd` will hold the total number of times the condition `tot >= k` is met for each test case, and this value will be printed for each test case. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, and `tot` will be updated for each test case, but their final values will not be retained after the loop finishes executing.
