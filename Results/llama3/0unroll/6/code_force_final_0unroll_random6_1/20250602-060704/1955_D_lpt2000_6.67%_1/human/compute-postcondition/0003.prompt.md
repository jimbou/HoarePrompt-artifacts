You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m space-separated integers (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D

        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                    C[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            tot = sum(D.values())
            fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all the test cases from the input, and the output will be the total number of times the condition `tot >= k` was met for each test case. The value of `nabors` will be the same as the initial state, and the input will be consumed. The output will be a series of integers, each representing the total number of times the condition was met for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
