Output State: The loop will have executed all the test cases from the input, and the output will be the total number of times the condition `tot >= k` was met for each test case. The value of `nabors` will be the same as the initial state, and the input will be consumed. The output will be a series of integers, each representing the total number of times the condition was met for each test case.
