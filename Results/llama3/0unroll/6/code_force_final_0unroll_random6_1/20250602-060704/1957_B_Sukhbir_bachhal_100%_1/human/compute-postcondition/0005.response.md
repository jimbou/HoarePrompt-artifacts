Output State: **The program returns the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, where the loop iterates over a list of two zeros.**

In this case, since the list `n` has two zeros, the loop will iterate twice. Therefore, the value of `position` will be 2. The program returns `position - 1`, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
