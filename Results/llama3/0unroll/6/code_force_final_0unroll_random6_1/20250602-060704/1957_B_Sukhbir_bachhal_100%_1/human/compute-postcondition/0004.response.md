Output State: **n is a list of two zeros, and position is the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `n` has been shifted to the right by the number of iterations of the loop, resulting in a list of two zeros. The variable `position` has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop.
