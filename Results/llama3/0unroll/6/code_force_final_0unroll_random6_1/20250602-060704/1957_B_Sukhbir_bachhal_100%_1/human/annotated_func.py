#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a list of two non-negative integers.
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, which is a negative integer and has no relation to the initial list n that contains two non-negative integers and is currently equal to 0.
    #State: *n is a list of two non-negative integers, and the sum of the elements in the list is not equal to 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is a list of two zeros, and position is the number of iterations of the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, where the loop iterates over a list of two zeros.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of iterations required to reduce a list of two non-negative integers to zero by repeatedly right-shifting the list, unless the input list is already zero, in which case it returns -1. The function returns the number of iterations minus 1, or -1 if the input list is zero.
