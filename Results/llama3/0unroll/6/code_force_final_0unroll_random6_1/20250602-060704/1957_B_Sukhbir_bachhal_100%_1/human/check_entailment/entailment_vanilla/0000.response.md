Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.
3. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k using the func_1 function. This function works by continuously right-shifting the bits of k until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
4. The program then constructs the sequence by appending the value 2^counter - 1 to the array, where counter is the position of the most significant bit. This value is chosen because it has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation that can be achieved with the given sum k.
5. The program then appends the value k - arr[-1] to the array, which is the remaining sum that needs to be accounted for.
6. The program then appends n-2 zeros to the array to complete the sequence.
7. If n is 1, the program simply prints k.

The program's logic is correct because it maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence by choosing the value with the most significant bit set to 1. The remaining sum is then accounted for by appending the difference to the array. The program also handles the case where n is 1 correctly by simply printing k.

Correctness: **True**
