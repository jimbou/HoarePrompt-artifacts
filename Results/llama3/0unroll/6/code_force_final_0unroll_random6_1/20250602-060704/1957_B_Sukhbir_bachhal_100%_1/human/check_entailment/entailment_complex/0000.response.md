Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

The function `func_1(k)` calculates the number of iterations required to reduce k to zero by repeatedly right-shifting k, which is equivalent to finding the most significant bit in the binary representation of k. This is used to construct the sequence by appending `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - arr[-1]` to the array, which ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s.

The program handles the edge case where n is 1 correctly by simply printing k. For n greater than 1, it constructs the sequence as described above and prints it.

The function `func_1(k)` is also correct. It correctly calculates the number of iterations required to reduce k to zero by repeatedly right-shifting k, unless k is already zero, in which case it returns -1.

Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
