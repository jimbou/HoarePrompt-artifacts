Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list.

After applying this operation, the program checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the list is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where the current element is less than or equal to the next element, but the next element is greater than 10. In this case, the program should also split the next element into its digits.

For example, consider the list [12, 34, 5]. The program will not split the element 34 into its digits because 12 is less than 34. However, the correct output should be 'Yes' because the list can be sorted by splitting the element 34 into its digits.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
