Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. 

The program iterates through the array from left to right. If it finds a pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them into the array. This process is repeated until no such pair is found. 

Then, it checks if the resulting array is sorted using the function `func_1`. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order by comparing the list with its sorted version. 

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
