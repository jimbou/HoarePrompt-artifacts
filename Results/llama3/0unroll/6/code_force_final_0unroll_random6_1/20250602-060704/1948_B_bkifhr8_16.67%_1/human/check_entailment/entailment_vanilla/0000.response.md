Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

3. It then iterates over the array from the second element to the last element. If it finds an element that is smaller than its previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them back into the array.

4. After modifying the array, it checks if the array is sorted in non-descending order using the function `func_1`.

5. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- The function `func_1` is not necessary. Instead of sorting the list and comparing it with the original list, the program can simply check if the list is sorted in non-descending order.

- The program only checks if the previous element is greater than 10 and the current element is smaller than the previous element. However, it does not check if the split digits are in non-descending order with the current element.

- The program does not handle the case where the array cannot be sorted in non-descending order even after splitting the elements.

- The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
            # Check if the split digits are in non-descending order with the current element
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
                print('No')
                break
    else:
        # Check if the array is sorted in non-descending order
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

Correctness: **False**
