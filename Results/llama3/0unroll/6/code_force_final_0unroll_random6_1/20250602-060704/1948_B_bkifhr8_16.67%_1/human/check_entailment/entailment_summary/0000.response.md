Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

However, there are a couple of issues with the program. Firstly, the program only checks if the list can be sorted by applying the operation to the previous element when it encounters an element that is smaller than the previous one. This approach is not sufficient because it does not consider all possible ways of applying the operation.

Secondly, the program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. However, this function sorts the list and then checks if it is equal to the original list. This approach is not efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

A more efficient approach would be to check if the list is sorted in a single pass, without sorting the list. This can be done by iterating over the list and checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element.

Correctness: **False**
