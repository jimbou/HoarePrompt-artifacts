Output State: **`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers, `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**

In this output state, the values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged as non-negative integers. A new variable `ret` is introduced, which holds the return value of the function `func_1` when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The specific value of `ret` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
