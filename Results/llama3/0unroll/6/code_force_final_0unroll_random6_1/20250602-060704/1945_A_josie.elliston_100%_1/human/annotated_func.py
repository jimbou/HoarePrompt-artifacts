    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger or equal to 3. Otherwise, no change occurs.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers, and if extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. If the current value of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals). The return value of func_1(extroverts, universals) is stored in ret.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of another function (func_1) called with extroverts and universals as arguments.
