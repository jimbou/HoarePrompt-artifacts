Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals in a way that fulfills all their wishes, so it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

Function 2 (`func_2`) takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` and returns the total.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly handles the cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants (i.e., when `func_1` returns `None`) and returns -1 in such cases. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for the introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Correctness: **True**
