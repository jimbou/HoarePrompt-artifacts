Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the minimum number of tents.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it is not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as input and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, in which case it is impossible to accommodate the participants. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the participants in all other cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
