Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input. It checks if the current value of `extroverts` is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, as input. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the return value in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences (i.e., when `extroverts` is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3). In such cases, `func_1` returns `None`, and `func_2` returns -1.

For valid inputs, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed. The use of the ceiling function in `func_1` ensures that the number of tents is rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is necessary since each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
