Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. However, in the program, when a player is eliminated, the Quaffle is not updated to remain on the cell.

For example, if the input is:

5 5
.. .. .. .. ..
.. .. .. .. ..
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
.. .. .. .. ..
.. .. .B .. ..
5
.B L
.B U
.B U
B0 L
B0 L

The program will output:

2 R0 ELIMINATED
4 B0 ELIMINATED
FINAL SCORE: 0 0

However, according to the problem description, when R0 is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing R0 and the Bludger. But in the program, the Quaffle is not updated, and it remains at the middle of the field.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
