Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the Quidditch game as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles player movements, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, and eliminating players who come into contact with the Bludger. The program also correctly prints the main events of the game, including goals scored and players eliminated, and finally prints the final score.

However, there is a small mistake in the function func_1. The function is supposed to return the new position of an entity after a move, but the program returns two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'. This is incorrect because the function should return the new position as a tuple of two integers, not the sum of integers and strings.

Correctness: **False**
