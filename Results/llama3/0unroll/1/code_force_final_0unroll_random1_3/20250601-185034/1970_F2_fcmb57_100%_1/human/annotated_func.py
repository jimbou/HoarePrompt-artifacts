#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then returns two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.
