Output State: **a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, x is the first integer in a, y is the second integer in a, dx is the first string in b, dy is the second string in b.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are determined by the initial values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` is a list of two integers, `x` and `y` will take on the values of these integers. Similarly, since `b` is a list of strings, `dx` and `dy` will take on the values of these strings. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
