Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program attempts to reverse this process by finding the unique characters in the encoded string, sorting them in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It tries to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters, but it does so in a way that modifies the original string. This is not the correct approach, as it can lead to incorrect results.

2. The function `func_1` also tries to insert characters into the list of unique characters, which is not necessary and can also lead to incorrect results.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded string contains duplicate characters. In the original encoding algorithm, each character in the original string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string. However, in the decoding process, the program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded string contains duplicate characters.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded string contains characters that are not present in the original string. In the original encoding algorithm, each character in the original string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string. However, in the decoding process, the program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded string contains characters that are not present in the original string.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the length of the encoded string is not equal to the length of the original string. In the original encoding algorithm, each character in the original string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string. However, in the decoding process, the program does not correctly handle the case where the length of the encoded string is not equal to the length of the original string.

Correctness: **False**
