Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function is trying to replace each character in the input string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, but it is doing so in a way that modifies the original string `s` and also updates the list of unique characters `unique_chars` in a way that is not consistent with the problem statement.

The main issue with the function is that it is using the `replace` method to replace characters in the string `s`, which replaces all occurrences of the character in the string, not just the first one. This means that the function is not correctly implementing the symmetric replacement described in the problem statement.

Additionally, the function is inserting characters into the list `unique_chars` at arbitrary indices, which is not consistent with the problem statement's requirement that the string `r` consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.

Correctness: **False**
