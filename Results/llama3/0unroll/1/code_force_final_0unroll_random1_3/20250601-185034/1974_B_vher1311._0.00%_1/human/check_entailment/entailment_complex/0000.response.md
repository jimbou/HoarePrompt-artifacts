Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the input string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function does not perform the decoding operation correctly.

The function first creates a list of unique characters from the input string `s` in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the input string `s` and replaces each character with the corresponding character from the list of unique characters in descending order. However, this operation is not the inverse of the encoding operation described in the problem statement.

The encoding operation replaces each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, where `r` is the string of unique characters from `s` in alphabetical order. To decode the string, we need to perform the inverse operation, which is to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

The function `func_1` does not perform this inverse operation correctly. Instead, it replaces each character in the input string `s` with the corresponding character from the list of unique characters in descending order, which is not the correct decoding operation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
