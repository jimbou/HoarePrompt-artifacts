Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the decoding problem described in the problem statement. However, the provided function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the decoding algorithm.

The decoding algorithm should work as follows:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the encoded string `b`, written in alphabetical order.
2. Replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

However, the provided function `func_1` is not correctly implementing this algorithm. It seems to be attempting to modify the original string `s` instead of the encoded string `b`, and it's also not correctly replacing the characters with their symmetric characters from the string `r`.

Moreover, the function is returning the string `r` which is not the decoded string, but rather the string of unique characters from the original string `s`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
