Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the program attempts to replace each character in the input string `s` with its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list. However, this approach is incorrect because it modifies the original string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to incorrect replacements.

For example, consider the input string "serofedsoc". The program will first replace 's' with 'c', but then it will replace 'c' with 's' again, resulting in an incorrect decoding.

A correct implementation would involve creating a new string where each character is replaced with its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list, without modifying the original string. This can be achieved using a dictionary to map each character to its symmetric character, and then using this dictionary to replace each character in the input string.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
```
This implementation correctly decodes the input string by replacing each character with its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list, without modifying the original string.
