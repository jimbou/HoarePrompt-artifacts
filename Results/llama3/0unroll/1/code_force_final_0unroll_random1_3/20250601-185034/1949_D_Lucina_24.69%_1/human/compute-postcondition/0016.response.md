Postcondition: **The program has iterated over the range from 1 to n (inclusive) and checked conditions for each index i. If the length of list sa is greater than or equal to the length of list sb, the program has appended indices i to sa where a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0, without modifying n, a, b, xx, or stdin. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, the program has constructed a string nx by iterating over xx and replacing '?' with 'S' or 'F' based on the presence of i or j in the first n // 4 elements of list sb, and then printed nx, leaving n, a, b, xx, stdin, sb, and sa unchanged.**
