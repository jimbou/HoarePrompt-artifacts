Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to create transition videos for a video game. The program takes as input the number of scenarios and the partial transition video plan, which includes 'F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, and '.' for the same scenario. The goal is to replace the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' in such a way that no matter the order of the scenarios, there will never be more than a certain number of transition videos of the same type in a row.

The program first counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters for each scenario and stores them in the a and b arrays. It then separates the scenarios into two groups: sa and sb, where sa contains scenarios with only 'F' characters and sb contains scenarios with only 'S' characters.

The program then decides which group to prioritize based on the size of the groups. If the size of sa is greater than or equal to the size of sb, it prioritizes sa; otherwise, it prioritizes sb. For the prioritized group, it replaces the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on certain rules.

The rules for replacing '?' characters are as follows:

- If the scenario is in the first n/4 scenarios of the prioritized group or if the other scenario is in the first n/4 scenarios of the prioritized group, it replaces the '?' character with 'F' if the prioritized group is sa, or with 'S' if the prioritized group is sb.
- Otherwise, it replaces the '?' character with 'S' if the prioritized group is sa, or with 'F' if the prioritized group is sb.

Finally, the program prints the constructed strings.

Correctness: **True**
