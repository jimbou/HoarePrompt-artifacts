Functionality: **This function reads n+1 inputs from stdin, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and the next n inputs are strings of length n containing 'F', 'S', or '?' characters. It then processes these inputs to determine the presence of 'F' and 'S' characters in each string and their corresponding indices. Based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters, it constructs new strings by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' according to certain rules. Finally, it prints the constructed strings. The function does not return any value, and its output is the printed strings.**
