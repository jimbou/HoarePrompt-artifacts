Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of creating transition videos for a video game. The program takes as input the number of scenarios (n) and the partial transition video plan, which is a matrix of characters where 'F' represents a funny video, 'S' represents a scary video, '?' represents an undecided video, and '.' represents the same scenario.

The program first initializes two arrays, a and b, to keep track of the number of funny and scary videos for each scenario. It then reads the input matrix and updates the arrays accordingly.

The program then identifies the scenarios that have only funny videos (sa) and only scary videos (sb). If there are more scenarios with only funny videos, it assigns the undecided videos to be funny for the first n/4 scenarios and scary for the rest. Otherwise, it assigns the undecided videos to be scary for the first n/4 scenarios and funny for the rest.

Finally, the program prints the updated transition video plan.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce a valid solution for the given problem. The program ensures that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type are played consecutively, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
