Output State: The loop has iterated over the range from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, it has constructed a string nx by iterating over the range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each character in the string xx[i][j - 1], if the character is not '?', it has been appended to nx. If the character is '?' and either i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of list sb, 'S' has been appended to nx; otherwise, 'F' has been appended to nx. After constructing nx, it has been printed. The values of n, a, b, xx, stdin, sb, and sa remain unchanged.
