You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^5) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has iterated over the string s, and for each character i, it has checked if i is in the set us. If i is in us, it has added i to the set win. If the length of win is equal to k, it has appended i to the list ans, incremented ps by 1, and cleared the set win. The final state is: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns and prints the string 'YES'
    #State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer less than n.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print the string formed by joining the characters in the list 'ans', followed by the first character in the set 'us' that is not in the set 'win', and then 'a' repeated (n - len(ans) - 1) times. The loop will terminate after the first iteration because of the return statement. The value of 'ps' remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The output will not be 'NO' because the loop will print a string before it can reach the print statement outside the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns and prints the string 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
