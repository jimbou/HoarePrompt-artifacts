Output State: The loop has iterated over the string s, and for each character i, it has checked if i is in the set us. If i is in us, it has added i to the set win. If the length of win is equal to k, it has appended i to the list ans, incremented ps by 1, and cleared the set win. The final state is: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list of characters, ps is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
