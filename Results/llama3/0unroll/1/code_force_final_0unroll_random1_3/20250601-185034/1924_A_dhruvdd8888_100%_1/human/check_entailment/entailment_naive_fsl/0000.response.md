Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will not correctly identify all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abbaa"`, the program will incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks for the presence of the characters 'a' and 'b' in the string, but it does not check for the presence of other characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

To fix this issue, the program should check if all characters in the string `s` are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
