Output State: **The program returns a string containing the number of elements in the list 'ans' followed by a newline character, and then the elements of 'ans' separated by spaces. The list 'ans' contains the powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), including the values 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), ..., 2^(l-1), in addition to the initial values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The value of l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6.**
