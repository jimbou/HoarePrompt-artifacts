Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 2 and k = 2. According to the problem description, the program should output a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v. However, the program outputs '1\n2' which does not meet the condition. The correct output should be '1\n1' because there is no subsequence with a sum of 2, but there is a subsequence with a sum of 1.
