Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in b. If k is 1 and n is not equal to 2, the values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged. Otherwise, the list ans contains the powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), including the values 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), ..., 2^(l-1), in addition to the initial values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1.***
