This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of a given integer n and an integer k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list containing the powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and includes the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The function then returns a string containing the number of elements in the list followed by the elements themselves, separated by spaces.
