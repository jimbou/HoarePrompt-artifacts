Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function takes a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank` as input. It checks if the length of the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` is 1, and if so, returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the list associated with key `da`, updates the `processing` list and a temporary variable `tmp` by calling another function `func_12`, and then updates the `rank` list with the minimum value returned by `func_12` plus one. The function returns this minimum value plus one. In all cases, the function modifies the `rank` list and returns an integer value.
Function number 13 :

 Output hints for function13:  Functionality: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b, using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are the integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is zero, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated GCD and coefficients.

''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of a given integer n and an integer k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list containing the powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and includes the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The function then returns a string containing the number of elements in the list followed by the elements themselves, separated by spaces.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
