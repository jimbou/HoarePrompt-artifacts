Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is the number of digits in bk, ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 up to 2^(lk-2) and the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1.**

The code block modifies the `ans` list by appending three new values: `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged. The `ans` list now includes the original powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)` and the three additional values calculated based on `k` and the sum of the original values in `ans`.
