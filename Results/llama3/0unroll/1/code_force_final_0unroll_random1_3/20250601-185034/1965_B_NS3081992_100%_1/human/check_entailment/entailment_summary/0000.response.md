Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v. The program uses a combination of functions to read input, process the data, and generate the required sequence.

Function func_14() is the core function that generates the sequence based on the binary representation of the input integers n and k. It handles the cases where k is 1 and where k is greater than 1 separately, ensuring that the generated sequence meets the problem's conditions.

Function func_15() is the main function that reads the number of test cases, calls func_14() for each test case, and writes the results to the standard output.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the functions seem to be working correctly. func_14() generates the correct sequence for different inputs, and func_15() writes the results to the standard output as expected.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
