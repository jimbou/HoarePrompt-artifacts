The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numTest`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). Since the code only reads the first integer from the input, the remaining input remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).

Output State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).**
