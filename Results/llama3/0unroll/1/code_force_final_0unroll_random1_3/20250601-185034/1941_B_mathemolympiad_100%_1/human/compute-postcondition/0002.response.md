Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of integers. It attempts to reduce each array to all zeros by applying a specific operation, which subtracts a value from the current element, twice that value from the next element, and the same value from the element after that. If the array can be reduced to all zeros, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
