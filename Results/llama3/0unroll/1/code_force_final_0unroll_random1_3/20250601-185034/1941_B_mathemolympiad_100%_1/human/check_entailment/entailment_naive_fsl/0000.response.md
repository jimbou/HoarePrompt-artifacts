Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

    4
    1 2 7 2

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first n-2 elements can be made zero, but it does not consider the last two elements. In the example above, the program will make the first two elements zero, but it will not be able to make the last two elements zero.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the last two elements can be made zero after making the first n-2 elements zero.
