Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be reduced to all zeros by applying the specified operation. The program iterates through the array, applying the operation to each element and its neighbors, and checks if the resulting array has all zeros. If any element becomes negative during the process, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If the array can be reduced to all zeros, it prints 'YES'.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array has less than 3 elements, or when the input array has non-integer or negative values. In these cases, the program will not attempt to apply the operation and will print 'NO' immediately.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
