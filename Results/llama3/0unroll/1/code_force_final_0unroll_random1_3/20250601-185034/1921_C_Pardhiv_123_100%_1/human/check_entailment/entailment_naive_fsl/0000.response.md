Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without running out of phone charge. It iterates through the list of message sending moments, calculates the minimum charge consumption between each pair of moments (either by keeping the phone on or turning it off and on), and subtracts this consumption from the initial phone charge. If the remaining charge is positive after all messages have been sent, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the phone charge is sufficient to send all messages without turning off the phone.
* When the phone charge is insufficient to send all messages without turning off the phone, but turning it off and on at the right moments can conserve enough charge.
* When the phone charge is insufficient to send all messages, even with optimal turning off and on.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the phone charge is exactly 0 or when there is only one message to send.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
