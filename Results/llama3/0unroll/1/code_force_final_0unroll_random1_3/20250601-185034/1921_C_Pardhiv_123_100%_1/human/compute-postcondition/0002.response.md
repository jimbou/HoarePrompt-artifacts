Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n integers m_1 to m_n. It then iterates through the integers m_i, subtracting the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from f. After the iteration, it prints 'YES' if f remains positive and 'NO' otherwise. This process is repeated for each test case, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs indicating whether f remains positive after the loop iterations for each test case.**
