The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer read will be the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**
