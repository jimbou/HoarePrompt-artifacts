#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the value of f remains positive after the loop iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n integers m_1 to m_n. It then iterates through the integers m_i, subtracting the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from f. After the iteration, it prints 'YES' if f remains positive and 'NO' otherwise. This process is repeated for each test case, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs indicating whether f remains positive after the loop iterations for each test case.
