This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the maximum number of elements that can be added to the list without violating certain conditions, and prints this value for each test case. The conditions are based on the presence of certain numbers in the list and the gaps between consecutive numbers. The function iterates over the test cases, processing each one independently, and does not modify the input values.
