The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The remaining input in the standard input is still `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x), and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x), and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
