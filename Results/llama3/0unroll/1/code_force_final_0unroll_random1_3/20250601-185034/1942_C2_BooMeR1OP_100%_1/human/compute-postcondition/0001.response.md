Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the maximum number of elements that can be added to the set `a` without violating the conditions, for each of the `t` test cases. The integers are printed on separate lines. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `n`, `x`, `y`, and the input lines, remains unchanged.**
