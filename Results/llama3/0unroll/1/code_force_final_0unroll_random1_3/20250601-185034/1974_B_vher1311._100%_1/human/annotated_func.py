#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each character in the original encoded string is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order, as defined in the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces each character in the input string with its corresponding character in reverse order, as defined by a mapping dictionary created from the sorted unique characters in the input string, and returns the resulting string.
