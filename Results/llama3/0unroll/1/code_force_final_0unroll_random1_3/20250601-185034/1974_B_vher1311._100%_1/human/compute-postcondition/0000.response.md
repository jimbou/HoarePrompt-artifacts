Output State: **encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string consisting of unique characters from encoded in ascending order, mapping is a dictionary where each character in r is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order.**

Here's a breakdown of the final state:

* `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
* `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order. This is because the `sorted` function sorts the characters in ascending order, and the `set` function removes duplicates.
* `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order. This is because the dictionary comprehension iterates over the indices of `r` and maps each character to its corresponding character in reverse order using the indexing `r[-(i + 1)]`.
