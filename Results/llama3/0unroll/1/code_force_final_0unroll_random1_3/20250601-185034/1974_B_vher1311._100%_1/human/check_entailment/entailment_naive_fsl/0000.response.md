Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is done correctly using the `sorted` function and `set` to remove duplicates.

2. Then, the program creates a mapping between each character in `r` and its symmetric character. This is done correctly using a dictionary comprehension.

3. Finally, the program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character using the mapping. This is done correctly using a generator expression.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the input string `b` contains duplicate characters, the program correctly ignores the duplicates when constructing the string `r`.
* When the input string `b` contains characters that are not in alphabetical order, the program correctly sorts the characters in `r`.
* When the input string `b` is a single character, the program correctly returns the same character.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases correctly.
