Reasoning:

1. The problem description is clear and well-defined, and the provided program attempts to solve the problem by decoding the given string.

2. The program starts by reading the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t) and the length of the string (n) for each test case.

3. For each test case, the program defines a function func_1 that takes the encoded string (b) as input and returns the decoded string.

4. Inside func_1, the program first constructs the auxiliary string r by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string in alphabetical order.

5. Then, the program creates a mapping dictionary where each character in r is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the same distance from the end of r).

6. Finally, the program uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character, and returns the decoded string.

7. The program then appends the decoded string to the results list and prints all the decoded strings at the end.

8. The program correctly handles the case where the input string has only one character, as shown in the example input.

9. The program also correctly handles the case where the input string has multiple characters, as shown in the other example inputs.

10. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
