Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a string `r` that consists of all distinct letters in `b`, sorted in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted` and `set` functions.

4. The program then creates a mapping dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character in reverse order. This is done using a dictionary comprehension.

5. Finally, the program uses the mapping dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character in reverse order, and returns the resulting decoded string.

6. The program appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints all the decoded strings after processing all test cases.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
