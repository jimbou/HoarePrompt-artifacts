Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the input string `b`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the auxiliary string should consist of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that each character in the string `s` should be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`.

3. The program then uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the input string `b` with its corresponding character in reverse order. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the decoding process should restore the original string `s` from the encoding result.

4. The program returns the resulting string, which is the decoded original string `s`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the output should be the string `s` from which the encoding result `b` was obtained.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
