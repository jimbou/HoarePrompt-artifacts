Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns, following certain rules. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes the number of columns (n) and two strings representing the arrows in the grid as input. It checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by iterating over the columns in steps of 2. If it finds a situation where the robot cannot move forward, it returns 'No'. If it successfully checks all columns without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

func_2 reads the input, processes each test case by calling func_1 with the provided input values, and prints the results separated by newline characters.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given rules. It handles all possible cases and returns the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
