Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting position (1, 1) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell. The input consists of the number of test cases, the number of columns, and the two rows of the grid, each represented as a string of '<' and '>' characters.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of columns `n`, and the two rows `row1` and `row2` as input. It first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`. Then, it iterates over the range `half_n - 1` and checks if the character at index `2 * i + 1` in `row1` is '<' and if the character at index `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` in `row2` is '<'. If this condition is true, it returns 'No'. After the loop, it checks if the last character in `row1` is '<' and the second last character in `row2` is '<'. If this condition is true, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input and processes each test case. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results`. Then, it iterates over the range `t` and reads the number of columns `n`, and the two rows `row1` and `row2` for each test case. It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to the `results` list. Finally, it prints the results joined by newline characters.

Correctness: **True**
