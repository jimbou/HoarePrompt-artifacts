Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n`, and the two rows of the grid as input, and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

The key part of the program is the loop in `func_1`, which checks if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n). The loop iterates over the first half of the columns, and for each column, it checks if the arrow in the current cell points to the left, and if the arrow in the cell below it also points to the left, or if the arrow in the cell to the right of it points to the left. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns 'No'.

If the loop finishes without returning 'No', the function checks the last column. If the arrow in the last column of the first row points to the left, and the arrow in the second last column of the second row points to the left, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It checks all possible paths and returns 'Yes' if there is a path, and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
