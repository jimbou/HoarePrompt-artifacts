Based on the precondition, the `results` list contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling the function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` with corresponding input values.

The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

Since the exact values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `results` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the results of calling `func_1` for each of the `t` input values, separated by newline characters.

Output: **the results of calling func_1 for each of the t input values, separated by newline characters**
