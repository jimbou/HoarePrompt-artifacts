Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

Function `func_1` checks if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) given two rows of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It returns 'Yes' if the move is possible and 'No' otherwise.

Function `func_2` reads input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the provided input values, and prints the results separated by newline characters.

The program's logic is correct. It checks for the conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n), such as a '<' in the first row and a '<' in the second row at the same or adjacent positions, or a '<' in the last position of both rows. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
