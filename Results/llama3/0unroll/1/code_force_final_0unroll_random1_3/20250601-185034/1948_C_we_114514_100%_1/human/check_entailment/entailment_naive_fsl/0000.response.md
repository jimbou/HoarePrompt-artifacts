Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
><>>

The program will return 'Yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

The issue is that the program only checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving right, but it does not consider the case where the robot moves down and then gets stuck in a loop. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle this case.
