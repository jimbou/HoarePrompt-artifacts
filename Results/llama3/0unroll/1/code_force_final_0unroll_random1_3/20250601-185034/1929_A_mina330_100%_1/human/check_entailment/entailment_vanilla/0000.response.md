Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the difference between the last element and the first element. This approach is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, rather than the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The program would sort it as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and calculate the difference as 5 - 1 = 4. However, the maximum beauty of this array can be obtained by rearranging it as [1, 5, 2, 4, 3], which has a beauty of (5 - 1) + (4 - 2) + (3 - 2) = 9.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
