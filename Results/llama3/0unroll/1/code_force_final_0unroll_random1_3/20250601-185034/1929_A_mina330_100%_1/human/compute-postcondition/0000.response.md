Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, `ntest` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `ntest` test cases. Each test case has an integer `n` between 2 and 100 inclusive, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
