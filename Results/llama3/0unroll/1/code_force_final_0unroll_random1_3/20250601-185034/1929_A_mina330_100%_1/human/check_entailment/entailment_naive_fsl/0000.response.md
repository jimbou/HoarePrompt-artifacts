Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. However, the program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, which is not the correct calculation.

For example, if the input array is [1, 3, 2], the program will output 2, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. However, the correct calculation of the beauty of the array is (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 1, which is not equal to 2.

To correctly calculate the beauty of the array, the program should sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The correct code should be:

def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(beauty)
