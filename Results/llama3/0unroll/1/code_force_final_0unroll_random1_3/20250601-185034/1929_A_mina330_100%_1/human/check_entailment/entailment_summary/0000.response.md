Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The given program sorts the input array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the smallest number first and the largest number last. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest numbers is the maximum possible difference, and by placing them at the beginning and end of the array, we maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly implements this insight by sorting the array and then printing the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
