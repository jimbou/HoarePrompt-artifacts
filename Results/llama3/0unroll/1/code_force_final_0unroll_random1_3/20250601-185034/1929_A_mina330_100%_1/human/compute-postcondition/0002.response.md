Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the input list. The function processes multiple test cases as specified by the initial input integer t, and it does not modify the input values or store any results beyond printing the differences for each test case.**
