Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the input array `a` in ascending order and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the smallest number first and the largest number last, and then arranging the remaining numbers in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The program correctly implements this approach by sorting the array and then printing the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.

Correctness: **True**
