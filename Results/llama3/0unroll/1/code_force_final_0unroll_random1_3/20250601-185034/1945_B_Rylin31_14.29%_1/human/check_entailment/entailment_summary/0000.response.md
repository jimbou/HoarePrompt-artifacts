Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program correctly handles the cases where the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) is divisible by both the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations (a and b), and where it is not. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where a or b is 1.

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for the given input. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
