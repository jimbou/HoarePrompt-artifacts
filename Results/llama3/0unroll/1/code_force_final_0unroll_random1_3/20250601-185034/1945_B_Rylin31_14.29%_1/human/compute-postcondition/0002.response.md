Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads an integer t, followed by t sets of three integers a, b, and m. For each set, it calculates a value mn and prints the result of either (mn // a + mn // b + 1) or (mn // a + mn // b), depending on whether m is divisible by both a and b and a and b are not 1. The function does not modify the input values.**
