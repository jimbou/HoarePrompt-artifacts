Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The program takes into account the frequency of launching for the first and second installations (a and b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).

The program calculates the minimum time (mn) it takes for a firework to be visible in the sky, which is the minimum of a and b plus m. It then checks if m is divisible by both a and b, and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result of the calculation (mn // a + mn // b), otherwise, it just calculates (mn // a + mn // b).

The reasoning behind this is that if m is divisible by both a and b, it means that the fireworks launched by both installations will be visible in the sky at the same time, and therefore, we need to add 1 to the result to account for the additional firework. However, if a or b is equal to 1, it means that the fireworks launched by that installation will be visible in the sky for only 1 minute, and therefore, we don't need to add 1 to the result.

The program then prints the result of the calculation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
