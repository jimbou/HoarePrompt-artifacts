Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line will be the result of the calculation (mn // a + mn // b + 1) if m is divisible by both a and b and a and b are not 1, otherwise it will be the result of (mn // a + mn // b). The values of t, a, b, and m will remain unchanged.**
