Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. It takes into account the frequency of launching for the first and second installations, as well as the time the firework is visible in the sky.

The program first calculates the minimum of the two frequencies plus the time the firework is visible in the sky (mn). Then, it checks if the time the firework is visible in the sky is a multiple of both frequencies and if both frequencies are not equal to 1. If this condition is met, it adds 1 to the result of the division of mn by both frequencies. Otherwise, it simply divides mn by both frequencies.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the program takes into account the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time, considering the overlap of fireworks launched from both installations.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
