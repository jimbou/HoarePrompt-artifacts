Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly processes the commands in the order they are written in the string s. It maintains a list b of the elements that are removed from the array a, and then calculates the product of these elements in reverse order, taking the remainder modulo m at each step. The result is a list of the remainders at each step, which is then reversed and returned.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the array a is empty or contains only one element, and where the string s contains only 'L' or only 'R' commands. The use of the modulo operator ensures that the product does not overflow, even for large inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
