    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list 'ans' which contains n positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' containing 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer 'm'. It rearranges the elements of 'a' based on the characters in 's', then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo 'm', and finally returns the reversed list of cumulative products.
