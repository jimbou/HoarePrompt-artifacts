Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that the operations can only decrease the values of the elements, and the parity of the elements (even or odd) remains the same. Therefore, if the first and last elements are odd, the second element must be two more than the first, and the second last element must be two more than the last. If these conditions are not met, it's impossible to make all elements zero.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'NO' if they are not met, and 'YES' otherwise. The program also correctly handles the case where the first or last element is zero, which is a special case.

Correctness: **True**
