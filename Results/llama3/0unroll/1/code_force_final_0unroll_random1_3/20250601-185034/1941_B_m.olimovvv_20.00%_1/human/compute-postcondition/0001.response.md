Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then checks if the first and second elements or the last and second last elements of the list satisfy certain conditions (specifically, if the first and last elements are odd and the second element is not two more than the first, or the second last element is not two more than the last). If these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for each test case and outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings corresponding to each test case.**
