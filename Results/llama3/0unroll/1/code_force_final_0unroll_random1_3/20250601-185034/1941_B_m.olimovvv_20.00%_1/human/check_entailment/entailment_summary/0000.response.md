Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that the operations can only decrease the elements of the array, and the parity of the elements (even or odd) is preserved. The program checks if the first and last elements of the array are even, and if the second element is two more than the first element, and the second last element is two more than the last element. If these conditions are met, it's possible to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operations.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first or last element is zero, and it correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
