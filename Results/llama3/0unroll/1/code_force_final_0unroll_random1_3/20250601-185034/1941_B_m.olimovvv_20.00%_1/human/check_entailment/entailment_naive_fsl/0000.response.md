Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks the parity of the first and last elements of the array, and the difference between the first two elements and the last two elements. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero.

A correct solution would need to check the entire array, not just the first and last elements. For example, it could check whether the sum of the elements at each index is a multiple of 3, and whether the difference between the elements at each index is a multiple of 2.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(a-2):
            if (b[i] + b[i+2] - 2*b[i+1]) % 3 != 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

This solution checks whether the sum of the elements at each index is a multiple of 3, and whether the difference between the elements at each index is a multiple of 2. If it finds any index where this is not the case, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".
