Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first checks if the first and last elements of the array are even or odd, and if the second and second-to-last elements are equal to the first and last elements plus 2, respectively. If these conditions are not met, it prints "NO", indicating that it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operation.

If the conditions are met, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the operation can only change the parity of the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and the element at index i must be even. Therefore, if the first and last elements are odd, and the second and second-to-last elements are not equal to the first and last elements plus 2, respectively, it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it only needs to iterate through the array once to check the conditions. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the input array.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
