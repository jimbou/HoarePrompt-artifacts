#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers.
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, indicating whether the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive elements in the array and the constant 'b' is less than the constant 'f'. The variables 'test_cases', 'feat', 'n', 'f', 'a', 'b', 'arr', and 'array2' have been updated after each iteration, but their values are not retained after the loop finishes. The stdin remains unchanged, as it is only used for input and not modified by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive elements in the array and the constant 'b', and checks if this sum is less than the constant 'f'. If the sum is less than 'f', it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function iterates over all test cases and prints the corresponding 'Yes' or 'No' for each case.
