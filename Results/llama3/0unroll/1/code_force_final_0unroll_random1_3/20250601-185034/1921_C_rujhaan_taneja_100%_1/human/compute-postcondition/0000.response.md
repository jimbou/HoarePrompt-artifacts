The code `test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line containing four space-separated integers, the input for `test_cases` will be the first integer of the first line of the first test case.

Let's denote the four space-separated integers as `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `test_cases` will be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is equal to `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains three remaining space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers.**
