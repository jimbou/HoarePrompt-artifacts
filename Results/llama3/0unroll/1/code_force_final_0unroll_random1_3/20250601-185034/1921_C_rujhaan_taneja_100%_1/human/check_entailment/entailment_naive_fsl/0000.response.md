Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. 

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the charge spent when the phone is turned off and on. The program checks if the time difference between two messages is less than `b/a`, and if so, it calculates the charge spent as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. However, this is incorrect because the program should also consider the case where the phone is turned off and on at the moment when the message is sent.

A correct implementation would be to calculate the charge spent as `min((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a, b)` for each pair of messages. This is because the phone can either be turned off and on at the moment when the message is sent, which costs `b` units of charge, or it can be kept on, which costs `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` units of charge.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    1 3 1 5
    3

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES". The correct sequence of actions is to turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 3, which costs 5 units of charge. Since the initial charge is 3 units, the phone will have 3 - 5 = -2 units of charge left, which is not enough to send the message. However, the program does not consider this case and incorrectly outputs "NO".
