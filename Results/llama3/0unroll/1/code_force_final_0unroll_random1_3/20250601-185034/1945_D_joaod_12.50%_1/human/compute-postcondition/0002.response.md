Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. It calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a final position from a given starting position, considering two different cost arrays. The function iterates over each test case, updating variables accordingly, and consumes the standard input. After all iterations, the function has printed the minimum cost for each test case, and the standard input is empty.**
