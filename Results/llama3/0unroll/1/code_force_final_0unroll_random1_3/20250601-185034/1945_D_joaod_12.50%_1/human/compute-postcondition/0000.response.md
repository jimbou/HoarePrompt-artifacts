Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second and third lines contain n space-separated integers (1 <= integer <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `cases` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
