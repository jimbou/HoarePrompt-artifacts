The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). So, `t` is assigned the value of this positive integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and we have read the first line, stdin now contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
