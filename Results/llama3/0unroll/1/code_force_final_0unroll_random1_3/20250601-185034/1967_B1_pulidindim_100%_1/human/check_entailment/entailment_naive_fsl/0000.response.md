Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the count of valid pairs.

The program starts with a count of 2 and increments it by 1 in each iteration of the while loop. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual values of 'n' and 'm'. The program also uses the variable 'countmins' which is not necessary and can be removed.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of 'b' from 1 to 'm' and for each 'b', calculate the number of valid 'a' values. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of 'a' from 1 to 'n' and checking if 'a + b' is a multiple of 'b * gcd(a, b)'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
