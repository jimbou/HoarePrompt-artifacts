Output State: **The output state will be the sum of the number of integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by each integer from 2 to m (inclusive), for each test case. The sum is calculated by iterating over each integer from 2 to m, and for each integer, adding the number of multiples of that integer in the range [1, n] to the total sum. The number of multiples is calculated by dividing n by the current integer, and then adding 1 if the result is not an integer. The loop breaks if the number of multiples is less than the current integer.**
