This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the number of integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by each integer from 2 to m (inclusive), and prints the result. The calculation is done by iterating over each integer from 2 to m, counting the number of multiples of that integer in the range [1, n], and adding it to the total sum. The function handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.
