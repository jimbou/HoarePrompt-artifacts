This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes as input a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases and a list 'test_cases' containing tuples of two positive integers 'n' and 'm' and a string 'a' of 'n' characters. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in the corresponding test case. The function does not modify the input variables 't' and 'test_cases'.
