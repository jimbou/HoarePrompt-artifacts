Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in the corresponding test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases, which is a positive integer 't'. Each integer in the list corresponds to a test case, which is a tuple containing two positive integers 'n' and 'm' (n <= 50, m <= 5) and a string 'a' of 'n' characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
