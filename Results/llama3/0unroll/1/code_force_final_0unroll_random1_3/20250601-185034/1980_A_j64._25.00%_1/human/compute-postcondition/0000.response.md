Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers n and m (n <= 50, m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `results` to store the results of the test cases. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of the `results` list, which is initially empty.
