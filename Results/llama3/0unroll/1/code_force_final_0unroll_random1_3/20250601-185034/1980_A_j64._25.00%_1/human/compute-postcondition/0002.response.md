Output State: The variable 'results' is a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in the corresponding test case. The variable 't' is still a positive integer, and 'test_cases' is still a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers 'n' and 'm' (n <= 50, m <= 5) and a string 'a' of 'n' characters from 'A' to 'G'.
