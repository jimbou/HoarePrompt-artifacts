Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a deque to efficiently keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, which is the definition of MEX.

The program iterates over the array a in reverse order, and for each element a_i, it calculates the corresponding element p_i in the permutation p as mex - a_i, where mex is the current minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. The program then updates mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p_i.

The program correctly handles the case where a_i is negative, which means that p_i is greater than mex. In this case, the program updates mex to be p_i, which is the correct minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program also correctly handles the case where a_i is non-negative, which means that p_i is less than or equal to mex. In this case, the program does not update mex, which is correct because mex is already the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program finally prints the constructed permutation p in the correct order, which is the reverse of the order in which the elements were calculated.

Correctness: **True**
