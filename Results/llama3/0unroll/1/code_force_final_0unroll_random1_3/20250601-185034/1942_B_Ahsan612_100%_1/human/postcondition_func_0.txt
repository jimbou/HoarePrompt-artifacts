The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints a list of integers, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding input integer from the maximum possible value (n) minus the current minimum value (mex), in reverse order of the input list. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the results for each case.
