Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a deque from the `collections` module, but it's not actually used in the code. Instead, the program uses a simple iterative approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `res` of length `n` with `None` values, which will store the constructed permutation.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`).
6. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates the corresponding element in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
7. If the calculated value `mex - ar[i]` is less than the current `mex`, it updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
8. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `res` as a space-separated string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `deque` module is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
