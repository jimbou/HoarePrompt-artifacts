The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `two`. The second line assigns the value of `z` to the variable `tmp`.

Considering the initial state, `x` is an integer equal to the first input, `y` is an integer equal to the second input, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its children, `rev` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its parents, `z` is an integer equal to the input `u`, `tmp` is an integer equal to the last node in the list of children of the node with key `u` in `lst`, and `one` is `False`.

After executing the code, the value of `two` becomes `True`, and the value of `tmp` becomes equal to `z`, which is the input `u`.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

- `x` is an integer equal to the first input.
- `y` is an integer equal to the second input.
- `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its children.
- `rev` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its parents.
- `z` is an integer equal to the input `u`.
- `tmp` is an integer equal to the input `u`.
- `one` is `False`.
- `two` is `True`.

Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its children, rev is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its parents, z is an integer equal to the input u, tmp is an integer equal to the input u, one is False, two is True**
