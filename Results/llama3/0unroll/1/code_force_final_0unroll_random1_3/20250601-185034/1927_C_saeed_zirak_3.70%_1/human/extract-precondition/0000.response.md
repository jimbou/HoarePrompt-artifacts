Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n and m are the lengths of arrays a and b, respectively, and k is an even number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. All integers are between 1 and 10^6.**
