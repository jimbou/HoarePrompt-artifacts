Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to k and checks if each number is present in both arrays. If it is, it increments the count of ones in the array with the lower count. If the number is only present in one array, it increments the count of ones in that array if the count is less than or equal to k/2. If the number is not present in either array, it breaks the loop.

After the loop, it checks if the counts of ones in both arrays are equal to k/2. If they are, it prints 'yes', indicating that it is possible to choose the elements in the required way. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program correctly handles the case where k is even, as specified in the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where the input arrays contain duplicate elements, as it only increments the count of ones in an array if the count is less than or equal to k/2.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
