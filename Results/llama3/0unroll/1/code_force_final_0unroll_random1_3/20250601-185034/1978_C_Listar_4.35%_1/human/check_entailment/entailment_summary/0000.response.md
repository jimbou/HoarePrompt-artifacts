Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. `func_2` correctly determines the validity of a permutation based on its length and required Manhattan value. It returns the original values if valid or zeros if invalid.

2. `func_1` correctly rotates the input list to the right by half of the input integer k places, moving the last element to the front, and returns the modified list, while keeping the input integer n unchanged.

3. `func_3` correctly prints a list of integers to the console, separated by spaces, preceded by 'YES', and followed by a newline, and returns None.

4. `func_4` correctly determines whether a certain condition is met based on the input values 'n' and 'k', which are integers within specific ranges. If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without performing any further actions. If 'n' is not 0, it calls `func_1` with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, assigns the result to 'l', and then calls `func_3` with 'l' as an argument.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
