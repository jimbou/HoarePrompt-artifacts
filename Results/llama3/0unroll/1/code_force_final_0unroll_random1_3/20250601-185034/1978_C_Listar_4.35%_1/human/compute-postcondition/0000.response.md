Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and they are the output of function func_2().**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the output of the function `func_2()`, which returns two integers within the specified ranges. The precondition that `n` and `k` are integers is still valid, and their ranges are updated to be within the specified bounds.
