This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the input values 'n' and 'k', which are integers within specific ranges. If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without performing any further actions. If 'n' is not 0, it calls another function 'func_1' with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, assigns the result to 'l', and then calls another function 'func_3' with 'l' as an argument. The function does not return any value in either case.
