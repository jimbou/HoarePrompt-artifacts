Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, l is the output of func_1(n, k)**

The first line assigns the output of `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` and `k` are the output of `func_2()`, and `n` is not equal to 0, `l` becomes the output of `func_1(n, k)`. The second line calls `func_3(l)`, but since the return value of `func_3(l)` is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the state of the program.
