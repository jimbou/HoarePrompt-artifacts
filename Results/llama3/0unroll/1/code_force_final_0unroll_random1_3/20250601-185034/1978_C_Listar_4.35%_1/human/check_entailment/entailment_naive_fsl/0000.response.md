Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is odd. In the `func_2` function, it checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` immediately, which means it will print "NO" without attempting to find a permutation. However, it is possible to find a permutation with an odd Manhattan value. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` has a Manhattan value of 3, which is odd.

The program should be modified to handle the case when `k` is odd correctly. One possible solution is to adjust the `func_1` function to handle odd `k` values by swapping two elements in the permutation.
