This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, x and n. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x that can divide x minus n times the divisor, resulting in a non-negative and divisible value. The function iterates through all possible divisors of x, checks the conditions, and updates the maximum divisor if a larger one is found. The function outputs the maximum possible value of the divisor for each test case.
