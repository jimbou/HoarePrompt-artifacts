Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a one-dimensional grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The program simulates the movement of a pinball placed on each cell, following specific rules, and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative counts of '<' and '>' characters, respectively. It then iterates through the input string, using the values in A and B to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the pinball's movement can be divided into two phases: moving to the left and moving to the right. The program uses the values in A and B to calculate the number of seconds spent in each phase and then combines these values to obtain the total number of seconds.

The program's output is a sequence of numbers, where each number represents the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the corresponding cell.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program appears to be working correctly, producing the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
