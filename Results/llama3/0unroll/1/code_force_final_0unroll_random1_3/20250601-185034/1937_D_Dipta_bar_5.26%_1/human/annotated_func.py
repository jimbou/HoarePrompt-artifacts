    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is as follows:
    #
    #- The variable 'l' has been incremented by the number of '>' characters in the string 's', and its final value is equal to the number of '>' characters in 's'.
    #- The variable 'r' has been decremented by the number of '<' characters in the string 's', and its final value is equal to the length of list 'B' minus the number of '<' characters in 's'.
    #- The lists 'A', 'B', 'idx_A', and 'idx_B' remain unchanged.
    #- The string 's' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.
    #- The loop has printed a sequence of numbers to the console, with each number calculated based on the current values of 'l', 'r', 'A', 'B', 'idx_A', 'idx_B', 's', and 'i' at each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers to the console. The sequence is calculated based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the string, with each number representing a specific count or distance between these characters. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to output this calculated sequence.
