Functionality: **The function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers to the console. The sequence is calculated based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the string, with each number representing a specific count or distance between these characters. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to output this calculated sequence.**
