Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is as follows:

- The variable 'l' has been incremented by the number of '>' characters in the string 's', and its final value is equal to the number of '>' characters in 's'.
- The variable 'r' has been decremented by the number of '<' characters in the string 's', and its final value is equal to the length of list 'B' minus the number of '<' characters in 's'.
- The lists 'A', 'B', 'idx_A', and 'idx_B' remain unchanged.
- The string 's' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.
- The loop has printed a sequence of numbers to the console, with each number calculated based on the current values of 'l', 'r', 'A', 'B', 'idx_A', 'idx_B', 's', and 'i' at each iteration.
