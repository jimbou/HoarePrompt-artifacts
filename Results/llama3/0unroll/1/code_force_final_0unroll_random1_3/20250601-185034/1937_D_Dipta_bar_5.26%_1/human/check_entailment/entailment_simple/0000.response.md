Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of '>' and '<' characters, respectively, from the left and right ends of the string. It also initializes two lists, idx_A and idx_B, to store the indices of the '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

The program then iterates over the string from left to right. For each character, it checks if it is '>' or '<'. If it is '>', it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sum of the number of '>' characters to the left and the number of '<' characters to the right. If it is '<', it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sum of the number of '<' characters to the right and the number of '>' characters to the left.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the pinball is placed at the left or right end of the grid.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
