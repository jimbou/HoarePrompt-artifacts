The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which initialize empty lists. The first line initializes an empty list `B`, and the second line initializes an empty list `idx_B`. These lines do not modify any existing variables or values.

Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**
