Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line containing a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^5. The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and m, and the second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
