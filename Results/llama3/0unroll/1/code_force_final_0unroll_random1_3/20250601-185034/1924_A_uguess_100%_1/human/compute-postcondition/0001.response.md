Output State: **The output state is a string of length n, where n is the number of test cases. Each character in the string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the corresponding test case has a solution or not. If the test case has a solution, the string contains 'YES'. If the test case does not have a solution, the string contains 'NO' followed by a string of length n-1, which is a possible solution for the test case. The possible solution is constructed by appending the first missing character in the string s to the string ans, and then appending 'a' (the first lowercase English alphabet) repeatedly until the length of the string is n-1.**
