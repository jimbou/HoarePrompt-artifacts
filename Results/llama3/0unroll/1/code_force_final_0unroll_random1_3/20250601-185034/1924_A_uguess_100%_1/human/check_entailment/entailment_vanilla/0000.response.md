Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, which represent the length of the strings, the number of lowercase English alphabets to use, and the length of the string s, respectively.
3. It then reads the string s.
4. The program initializes a counter cnt to 0, a variable cur to 0, and an empty string ans.
5. It then iterates over each character ss in the string s.
6. For each character ss, it calculates the ASCII value of ss minus the ASCII value of 'a' to get the index of the character in the alphabet (cur_ss).
7. If the bit corresponding to cur_ss is not set in the variable cur, it sets the bit and increments cur.
8. If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, it means that all k characters have been found in the current substring, so it increments cnt, resets cur to 0, and appends the current character ss to ans.
9. After iterating over the entire string s, if cnt is greater than or equal to n, it means that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of s, so it prints 'YES'.
10. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string tmp by finding the first character that is not present in the current substring (i.e., the first bit that is not set in cur). It then appends this character to ans, followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and prints the resulting string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
