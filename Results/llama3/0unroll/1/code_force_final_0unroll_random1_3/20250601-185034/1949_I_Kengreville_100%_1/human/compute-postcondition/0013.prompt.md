You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), then n lines each containing three integers x, y, and r (−10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: The values of x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. The values of visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is False.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. tot is 0, bipartite is True. If ok is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. tot is 0, bipartite is True, and the current value of ok is True, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is False, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
