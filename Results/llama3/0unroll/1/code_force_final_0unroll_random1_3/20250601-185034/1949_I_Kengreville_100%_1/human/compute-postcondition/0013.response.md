Functionality: **This function reads n+1 inputs from stdin, where n is an integer followed by n lines each containing three integers x, y, and r. It then processes these inputs and checks for a specific condition. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input values.**
