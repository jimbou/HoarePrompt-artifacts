Output State: **x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. Additionally, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is False.**

In this output state, the values of x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. The values of visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced three new variables: tot, bipartite, and ok. The variable tot is initialized to 0, bipartite is set to True, and ok is set to False.
