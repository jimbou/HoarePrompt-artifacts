i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, where x[i], y[i], and r[i] represent the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of the i-th disk, respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n, where visited[i] indicates whether the i-th disk has been visited. coef is a list of integers of length n, where coef[i] represents the coefficient of the i-th disk. tot and bipartite are variables that keep track of the total coefficient and whether the graph is bipartite, respectively.
