Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: x, y, and r are lists of n integers, where each integer is one of the three integers input from stdin for each iteration of the loop. visited, coef, and stdin remain unchanged. tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is False.
