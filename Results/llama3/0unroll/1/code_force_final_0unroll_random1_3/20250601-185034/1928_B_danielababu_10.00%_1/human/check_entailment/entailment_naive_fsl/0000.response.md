Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array a that can be obtained after adding some permutation to the array a. However, the provided code does not implement any solution to this problem. It only contains some general-purpose functions for reading input, sorting, and calculating prefixes and suffixes, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

A correct solution to the problem would involve sorting the array, then iterating over the sorted array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The provided code does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.
