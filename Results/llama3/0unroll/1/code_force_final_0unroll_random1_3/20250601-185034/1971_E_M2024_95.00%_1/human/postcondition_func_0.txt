This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by a list of k integers a_i, a list of k integers b_i, and q integers d. It calculates and prints the values of m for q queries in each test case, where m is calculated based on the values of a, b, and the query value ql. The function processes t test cases and updates the values of n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, and v for each test case. The final values of these variables are the values from the last test case. The function does not modify the values of t and stdin.
