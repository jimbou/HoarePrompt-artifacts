Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach a certain point based on the given distances and times.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of test cases `t`, the final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. It correctly calculates the differences in distances `ad` and times `bd` between consecutive points.

3. It correctly calculates the speed `v` at each point by dividing the distance difference by the time difference.

4. For each query, it correctly finds the point `s` where the query distance `ql` lies between the distances `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.

5. It correctly calculates the time `m` it takes to reach the query distance `ql` by adding the time it takes to reach the previous point `b[s-1]` and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance `ql - a[s-1]` at the speed `v[s]`.

6. It correctly prints the calculated time `m` for each query.

7. It correctly handles the case where the query distance `ql` is exactly equal to one of the given distances `a[s]`, in which case it simply prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
