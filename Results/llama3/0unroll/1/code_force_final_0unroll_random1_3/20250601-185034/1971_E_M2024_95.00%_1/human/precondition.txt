stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second line contains k integers a_i. The third line contains k integers b_i. The following q lines contain a single integer d. n and k are positive integers, q is a non-negative integer, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, a_k = n, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, and 0 <= d <= n.
