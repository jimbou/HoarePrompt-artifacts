Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, then a list of k integers a_i, then a list of k integers b_i, and finally q integers d. n and k are positive integers, q is a non-negative integer, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, a_k = n, and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases minus one. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one integer has been removed from the input. The rest of the conditions for the test cases remain the same.
