Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, then a list of k integers a_i, then a list of k integers b_i, and finally q integers d. n and k are positive integers, q is a non-negative integer, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, a_k = n, and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
