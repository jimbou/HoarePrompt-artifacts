Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the time it takes for the car to reach each query point by using the given speeds and distances.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the differences in distances (ad) and times (bd) between consecutive points.
2. It then calculates the speeds (v) at each segment by dividing the distance difference by the time difference.
3. For each query, it finds the segment where the query point lies by using binary search (bisect_left).
4. If the query point is exactly at a known point, it prints the corresponding time.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the time it takes to reach the query point by adding the time it takes to reach the previous known point (b[s-1]) and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]).

The program correctly handles all cases, including when the query point is exactly at a known point, and when it's not. It also correctly calculates the time it takes to reach each query point by using the given speeds and distances.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
