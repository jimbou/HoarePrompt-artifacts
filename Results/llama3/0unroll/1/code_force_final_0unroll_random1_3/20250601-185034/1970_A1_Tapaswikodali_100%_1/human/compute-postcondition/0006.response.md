Functionality: This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on their balance (the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses) and position in the string, and returns the sorted string. The function assumes that the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It processes the string character by character, maintaining a balance counter to track the balance of opening and closing parentheses. The function then sorts the characters based on their balance and position, and finally returns the sorted string.
