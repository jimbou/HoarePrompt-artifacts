Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence. The program consists of two functions: a comparison function and the main function `func_2`.

The comparison function compares two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, based on their 'balance' and 'position' attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the two balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the position of `infoB` and the position of `infoA`. This function is used as the sorting key in the `func_2` function.

The `func_2` function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects representing the balance and index of each character in the string, sorts the list based on the balance and position of the characters, and returns a new string with the sorted characters.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It first computes the balance of each prefix of the input sequence and stores this information in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects. Then, it sorts the list based on the balance and position of the characters. Finally, it constructs the balanced shuffle by concatenating the characters in the sorted order.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
