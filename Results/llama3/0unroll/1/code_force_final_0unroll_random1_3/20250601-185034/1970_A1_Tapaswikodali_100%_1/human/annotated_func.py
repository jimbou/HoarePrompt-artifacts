#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and infoB, where both balances are integers and not equal to each other.
    #State: *infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer. The balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position of infoB and the position of infoA, where both positions are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, based on their 'balance' and 'position' attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the two balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the position of infoB and the position of infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The balance_info list contains n BalanceInfo objects, each representing the balance and index of the corresponding character in the string s. The balance variable is 0, indicating that the string s is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string of characters from the balance_info list, in the order they appear after sorting (where balance_info list contains BalanceInfo objects, each representing the balance and index of the corresponding character in the string s, sorted by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on their balance and position in the string, and returns a new string with the sorted characters. The function does not modify the original string. The returned string contains the same characters as the input string, but in a different order, with all opening parentheses coming before all closing parentheses, and characters with the same balance sorted in reverse order of their original position in the string.
