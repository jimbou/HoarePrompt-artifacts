Functionality: **This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on their balance and position in the string, and returns a new string with the sorted characters. The function does not modify the original string. The returned string contains the same characters as the input string, but in a different order, with all opening parentheses coming before all closing parentheses, and characters with the same balance sorted in reverse order of their original position in the string.**
