Output State: **The loop will terminate when the queue is empty, and the output state will be the distance from the start node to the target node in the tree.**

In natural language, the output state represents the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree. The loop iterates through the nodes in the tree, exploring neighboring nodes that have not been visited before, and keeps track of the distance from the start node to each node. When the target node is reached, the loop returns the distance, which is the output state.
