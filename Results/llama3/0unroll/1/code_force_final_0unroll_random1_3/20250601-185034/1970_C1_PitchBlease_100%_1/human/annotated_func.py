#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, edges is a list of pairs of positive integers representing the edges of a tree with n nodes, and start is a positive integer representing the starting node. The tree has exactly two leaves and is represented as an array-like tree.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with two leaves, based on the parity of the distances from a starting node to each leaf. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges representing the tree, and a starting node. The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', depending on whether the distances from the starting node to the leaves have different parities or the same parity, respectively.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when the queue is empty, and the output state will be the distance from the start node to the target node in the tree.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the tree, and the distance from the start node to the target node is unknown.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It takes three parameters: the start node, the target node, and a dictionary representing the tree structure. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if it exists in the tree; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found.
