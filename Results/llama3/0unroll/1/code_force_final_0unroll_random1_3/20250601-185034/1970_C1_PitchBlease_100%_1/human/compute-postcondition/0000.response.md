Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start**.

In this output state, the initial state's information about start, target, and tree remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify these variables. The code introduces two new variables: queue and visited. The queue is initialized as a deque containing a tuple of the start node and the value 0, indicating the starting point of a traversal or search operation with a distance or level of 0. The visited set is initialized with the start node, indicating that this node has been marked as visited, likely to keep track of nodes that have already been processed in the traversal or search operation.
