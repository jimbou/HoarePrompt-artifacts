Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with two leaves, based on the parity of the distances from a starting node to each leaf. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges representing the tree, and a starting node. The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', depending on whether the distances from the starting node to the leaves have different parities or the same parity, respectively.**
