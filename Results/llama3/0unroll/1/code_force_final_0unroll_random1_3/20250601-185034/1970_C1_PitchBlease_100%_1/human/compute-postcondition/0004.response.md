Postcondition: **tree is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, leaves is a list containing two nodes that are leaves of the tree, dist1 is the shortest distance from the start node to the first leaf node, dist2 is the shortest distance from the start node to the second leaf node. The current value of either dist1 or dist2 (or both) is an odd number.**
