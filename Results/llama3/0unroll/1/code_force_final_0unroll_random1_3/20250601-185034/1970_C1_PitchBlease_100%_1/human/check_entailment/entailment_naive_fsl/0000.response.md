Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the tree has more than two leaves. In the problem description, it is stated that the tree has exactly two leaves, but the program does not check for this condition. If the tree has more than two leaves, the program will not work correctly.

In the function `func_1`, the program assumes that there are only two leaves in the tree and uses the list `leaves` to store the leaves. However, if there are more than two leaves, the program will only consider the first two leaves in the list and ignore the rest. This will lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the tree has exactly two leaves before proceeding with the rest of the logic. If the tree has more than two leaves, the program should raise an error or handle the case accordingly.

Here is an example of a tree with more than two leaves that will cause the program to fail:

Input:

    5 1
    
    1 2
    
    2 3
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    5 6
    
    6

Output:

    Hermione ( incorrect output )

In this example, the tree has three leaves (5, 6, and 4), but the program will only consider the first two leaves (5 and 6) and ignore the third leaf (4). This will lead to incorrect results.
