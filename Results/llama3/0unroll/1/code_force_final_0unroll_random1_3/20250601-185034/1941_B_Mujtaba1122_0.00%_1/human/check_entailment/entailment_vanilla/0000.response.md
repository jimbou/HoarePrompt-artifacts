Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. 

`func_2` tries to make all elements in the list zero by repeatedly applying the given operation. However, there are several issues with `func_2`:

1. The while loop condition is incorrect. It checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`, but it should check if `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1` because the operation requires at least 2 elements in `list[i]`, 1 element in `list[i - 1]`, and 1 element in `list[i + 1]`.

2. Inside the while loop, the operation is applied incorrectly. The correct operation should be `list[i - 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1`. However, the program is multiplying `list[i - 1]` with itself, `list[i]` with `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` with `list[i - 1]`, which is incorrect.

3. The program does not handle the case when `n` is less than 3. According to the problem statement, `n` should be at least 3.

4. The program does not handle the case when the input list contains non-integer or negative values. According to the problem statement, the input list should contain non-negative integers.

5. The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem statement, the input list should not be empty.

6. The program does not check if the operation can be applied at the first and last indices. According to the problem statement, the operation can be applied at any index `i` such that `2 <= i <= n - 1`.

7. The program does not check if the operation can be applied at the indices where `list[i]` is odd. According to the problem statement, the operation can only be applied at indices where `list[i]` is even.

8. The program does not check if the operation can be applied at the indices where `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is zero. According to the problem statement, the operation can only be applied at indices where `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are non-zero.

9. The program does not check if the operation can be applied at the indices where `list[i]` is greater than `list[i - 1] + list[i + 1]`. According to the problem statement, the operation can only be applied at indices where `list[i]` is less than or equal to `list[i - 1] + list[i + 1]`.

10. The program does not check if the operation can be applied at the indices where `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is greater than `list[i]`. According to the problem statement, the operation can only be applied at indices where `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are less than or equal to `list[i]`.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
