#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if the first n elements of a given list are all equal to 0, returning True if they are and False otherwise.

    #State: The list is modified such that all elements except the first and last are 0, and the first and last elements are reduced by the sum of all the original elements in the list except the first and last. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of integers by setting all elements except the first and last to 0, and reduces the first and last elements by the sum of all original elements in the list except the first and last. It then checks the modified list using the function func_1(list, n) and prints 'YES' if the function returns True, and 'NO' otherwise.
