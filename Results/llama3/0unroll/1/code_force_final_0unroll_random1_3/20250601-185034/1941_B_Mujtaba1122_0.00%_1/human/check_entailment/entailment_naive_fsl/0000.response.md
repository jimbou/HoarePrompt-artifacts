Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by repeatedly applying the operation, but it does not consider the actual values of the elements.

For example, consider the input array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]. The program will output "YES" because it can make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation. However, the actual values of the elements are not considered. If we apply the operation at i=4, we get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1], which is not the same as the original array.

A correct solution would need to consider the actual values of the elements and check if they can be made zero by repeatedly applying the operation. The program does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_make_zero(arr):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This solution correctly checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by repeatedly applying the operation, and it considers the actual values of the elements.
