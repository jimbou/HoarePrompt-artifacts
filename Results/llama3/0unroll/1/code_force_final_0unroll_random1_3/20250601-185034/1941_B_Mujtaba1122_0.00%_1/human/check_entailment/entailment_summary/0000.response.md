Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

Function func_1 checks if the first n elements of a list are all equal to 0, which is used to verify if the array can be made zero.

Function func_2 attempts to make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying the operation. However, the implementation of func_2 is incorrect. The while loop condition is incorrect, and the subtraction operations inside the loop are also incorrect. The correct implementation should involve subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, until the element at index i becomes 0 or 1.

Due to the incorrect implementation of func_2, the program will not produce the correct output for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
