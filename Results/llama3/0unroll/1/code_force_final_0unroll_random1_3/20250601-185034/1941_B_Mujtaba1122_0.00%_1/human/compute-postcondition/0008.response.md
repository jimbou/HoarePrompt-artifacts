Functionality: This function modifies a list of integers by setting all elements except the first and last to 0, and reduces the first and last elements by the sum of all original elements in the list except the first and last. It then checks the modified list using the function func_1(list, n) and prints 'YES' if the function returns True, and 'NO' otherwise.
