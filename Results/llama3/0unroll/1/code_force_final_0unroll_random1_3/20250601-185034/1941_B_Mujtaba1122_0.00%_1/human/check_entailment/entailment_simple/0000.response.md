Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements in the list are equal to 0 within the first n elements. func_2 applies the operation to the list until all elements except the first and last are 0, and then checks if the first and last elements can be reduced to 0 using func_1.

However, there is a logical error in func_2. The while loop condition is incorrect, as it checks if list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0, but then subtracts 1 * list[i - 1] from list[i - 1], 2 * list[i - 1] from list[i], and 1 * list[i - 1] from list[i + 1]. This is not the correct implementation of the operation.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the length of the list is less than 3, which is a valid input according to the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
