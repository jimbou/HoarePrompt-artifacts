Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to construct the original string by iterating over the reversed array and appending the corresponding letter to the answer string. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual count of each number in the original array.

The line `ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])` is incorrect because it counts the occurrences of the current number in the reversed array from the current index to the end, which is not the correct way to determine the corresponding letter.

A correct approach would be to use a frequency array to keep track of the count of each number in the original array, and then use this frequency array to construct the original string.

Correctness: **False**
