Output State: The loop iterates over the list of integers 'arr' of length 'n'. If an integer is positive, it appends the current value of 'minn' to the list 'mex', marks 'minn' as used, and increments 'minn' until it finds an unused number. If an integer is non-positive, it appends the absolute difference between the integer and 'minn' to 'mex' and marks this difference as used. After the loop, 'mex' contains 'n' integers, 'used' contains all numbers from 0 to 'n-1', and 'minn' is equal to 'n'.
