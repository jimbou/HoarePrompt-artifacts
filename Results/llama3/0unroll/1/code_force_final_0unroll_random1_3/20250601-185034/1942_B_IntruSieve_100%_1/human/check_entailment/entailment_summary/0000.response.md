Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum excluded values (MEX) for each element in the array and prints these values separated by a space.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
2.  It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the minimum excluded values and a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum excluded value.
3.  It iterates over the array elements. If an element is positive, it appends the current minimum excluded value `minn` to the `mex` list and marks it as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds an unused value.
4.  If an element is negative, it calculates the minimum excluded value by subtracting the element's absolute value from `minn` and appends it to the `mex` list. It also marks this value as used.
5.  Finally, it prints the minimum excluded values in the `mex` list separated by a space.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles both positive and negative elements in the array correctly. It also ensures that each minimum excluded value is unique by marking used values and incrementing `minn` accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
