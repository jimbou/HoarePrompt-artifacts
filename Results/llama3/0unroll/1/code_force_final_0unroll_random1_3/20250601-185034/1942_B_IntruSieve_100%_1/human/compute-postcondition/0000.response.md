Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). n is an integer equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin, where n is the value read in the first line. The third line initializes an empty list mex. The fourth line initializes a variable minn to 0. The fifth line initializes an empty dictionary used. After executing the code, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers. The variable n is assigned the value of the first input, arr is assigned the list of n integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, and used is an empty dictionary.
