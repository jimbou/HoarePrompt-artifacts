Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the current permutation, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.

The program iterates through the array a, and for each element, it checks if the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it means that the current number in the permutation is equal to the current `mex` value, so it appends the `mex` value to the `mex` list and increments the `mex` value until it finds a number that has not been used yet. If the element is negative, it means that the current number in the permutation is equal to the absolute value of the element minus the current `mex` value, so it appends this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used.

Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation p.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the input array a contains positive and negative numbers, and where the input array a contains duplicate numbers. The program also correctly handles the case where the input array a is empty.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
