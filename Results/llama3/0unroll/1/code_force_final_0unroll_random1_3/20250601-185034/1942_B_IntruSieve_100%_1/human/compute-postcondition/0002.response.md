Output State: The loop iterates over the array 'arr' of length 'n'. For each positive element in 'arr', it appends the current value of 'minn' to the list 'mex', marks 'minn' as used, and increments 'minn' until it finds an unused value. For each non-positive element in 'arr', it appends the absolute difference between the element and 'minn' to 'mex' and marks this difference as used. After the loop, 'mex' contains the minimum excluded values for each element in 'arr', 'used' contains all the values that have been used, and 'minn' is the smallest unused value.
