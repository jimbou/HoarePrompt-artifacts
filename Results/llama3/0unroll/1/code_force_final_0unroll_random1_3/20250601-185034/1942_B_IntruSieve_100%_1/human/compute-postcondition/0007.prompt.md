You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the array 'arr' of length 'n'. For each positive element in 'arr', it appends the current value of 'minn' to the list 'mex', marks 'minn' as used, and increments 'minn' until it finds an unused value. For each non-positive element in 'arr', it appends the absolute difference between the element and 'minn' to 'mex' and marks this difference as used. After the loop, 'mex' contains the minimum excluded values for each element in 'arr', 'used' contains all the values that have been used, and 'minn' is the smallest unused value.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop prints all the elements in 'mex' separated by a space, and 'mex', 'used', and 'minn' remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: all the elements in 'mex' separated by a space

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
