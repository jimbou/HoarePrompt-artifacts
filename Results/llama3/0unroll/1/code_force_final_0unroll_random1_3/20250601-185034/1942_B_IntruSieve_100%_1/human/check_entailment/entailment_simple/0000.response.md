Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It iterates over the array `arr` and calculates the minimum excluded value (`mex`) for each element. If the element is positive, it appends the current `minn` value to `mex` and increments `minn` until it finds an unused value. If the element is non-positive, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to `mex`.
3.  After calculating the `mex` values, the program prints them separated by a space.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
