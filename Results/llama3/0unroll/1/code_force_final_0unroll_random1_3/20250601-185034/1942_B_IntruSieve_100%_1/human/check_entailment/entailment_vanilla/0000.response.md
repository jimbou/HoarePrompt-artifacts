Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation, a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used integers.
4. It then iterates over the array `a`. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than 0. If it is, it appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds a non-used integer.
5. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it calculates the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to the `mex` list. It also marks this value as used.
6. After constructing the permutation, it prints the elements of the `mex` list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The function `func_1` is not necessary and can be removed. The code inside the function can be directly placed inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.
* The variable `used` is not necessary and can be removed. The program can simply use a set to keep track of the used integers.
* The program can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure, such as a set, to keep track of the used integers.

Despite these minor issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
