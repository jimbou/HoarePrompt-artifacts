Output State: **tc = 0**.

The output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `tc` has been decremented to 0. The loop has processed all the test cases provided in the input, and the program has printed the result for each test case, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the condition evaluated in the loop. The state of the other variables, such as `n` and `arr`, is not relevant to the output state, as they are local to the loop and do not affect the overall program state.
