Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. t, n, and a_i are positive integers. 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of t, n, and a_i are still positive integers, and the constraints on their values remain the same.
