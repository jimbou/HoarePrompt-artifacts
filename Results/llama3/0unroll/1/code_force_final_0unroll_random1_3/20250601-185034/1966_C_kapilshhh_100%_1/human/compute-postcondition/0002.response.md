Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the provided integers. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the winner for each test case. The function modifies the input integers by sorting and removing duplicates, and uses dynamic programming to evaluate the difference between consecutive integers. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the variable 'tc' set to 0.**
