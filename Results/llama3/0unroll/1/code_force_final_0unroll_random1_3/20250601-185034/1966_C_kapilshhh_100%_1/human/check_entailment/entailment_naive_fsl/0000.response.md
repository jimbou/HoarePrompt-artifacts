Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program uses the dynamic programming (dp) variable. The dp variable is initially set to True and then updated based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual game strategy.

A correct approach would be to calculate the Nim-sum of the array, which is the bitwise XOR of all the elements. If the Nim-sum is zero, then Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The program does not calculate the Nim-sum correctly.

For example, consider the input [1, 2, 3]. The program will output "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice" because the Nim-sum of [1, 2, 3] is 1^2^3 = 0, which means Alice wins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
