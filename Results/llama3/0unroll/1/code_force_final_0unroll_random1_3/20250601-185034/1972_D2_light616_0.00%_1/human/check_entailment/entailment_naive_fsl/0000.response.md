Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The key insight in the program is the use of the fact that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` if and only if `a + b` is a multiple of `x + y`, where `x` and `y` are the greatest common divisors of `a` and `b`, respectively. This allows the program to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` and count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

The program also correctly handles the case where `x * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, in which case there are no more pairs to count.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
