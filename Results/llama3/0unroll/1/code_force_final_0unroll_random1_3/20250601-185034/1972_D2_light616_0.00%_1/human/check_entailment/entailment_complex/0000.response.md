Reasoning:

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) within the given ranges 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m. It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of x and y, where x and y are coprime (i.e., gcd(x, y) == 1). For each coprime pair (x, y), it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions and increments the count `cnt`.

`func_2` reads a positive integer t from standard input and executes `func_1` t times.

The key insight here is that the condition "b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b" is equivalent to "a and b are coprime". This is because if a and b are coprime, then gcd(a, b) = 1, and therefore b * gcd(a, b) = b, which is a multiple of a + b.

Since `func_1` correctly calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) within the given ranges, and `func_2` executes `func_1` the correct number of times, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
