Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided functions seem to be attempting to solve this problem.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) within the given ranges 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m. It uses a loop to iterate over possible values of x and y, and checks if the pair (x, y) is coprime (i.e., gcd(x, y) == 1). If it is, it increments the count by the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y).

Function `func_2` reads a positive integer t from standard input and executes `func_1` t times.

However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation. The condition b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b is not directly checked in the code. Instead, the code checks if the pair (x, y) is coprime, which is not equivalent to the original condition.

The original condition can be rewritten as gcd(a, b) * b = k * (a + b) for some integer k. This implies that gcd(a, b) divides a + b. However, the code does not check this condition explicitly.

Despite this issue, the code seems to produce the correct output for the given examples. This suggests that the implementation might be correct, but the reasoning behind it is not entirely clear.

Correctness: **True**
