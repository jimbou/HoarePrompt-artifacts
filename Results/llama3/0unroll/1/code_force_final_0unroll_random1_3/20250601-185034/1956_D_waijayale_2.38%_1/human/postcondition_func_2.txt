This function modifies a subarray of a given list `a` within a specified range `[l, r]` (inclusive) based on the sum of its elements. If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it replaces all elements in the subarray with the length of the subarray. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the subarray split at the index of the maximum value within the range, potentially modifying the subarray if the maximum value is not at the start or end of the range. The function also keeps track of the operations performed by appending the modified range to the `ops` list.
