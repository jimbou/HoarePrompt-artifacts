Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers. If the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray, the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is modified to contain the value `r - l + 1` at each index. Otherwise, the function either returns the result of the recursive call with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, or does not make any changes, depending on whether the index of the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is equal to `r` or not. In both cases, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the sum and maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) are still satisfied.**
