Postcondition: ***l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers. If the index of the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive) is not equal to l, then the sum of the elements in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive) is greater than (pos - 1 - l + 1) * (pos - 1 - l + 1), and the maximum value in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive) is the value at index pos in a, and a value has been returned. Otherwise, no changes have been made.***
