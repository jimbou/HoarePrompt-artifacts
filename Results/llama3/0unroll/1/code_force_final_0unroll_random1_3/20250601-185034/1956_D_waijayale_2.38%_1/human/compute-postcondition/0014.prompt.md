You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers.
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: The subarray of a from index l to r (inclusive) has been modified to contain the value r - l + 1 at each index, while the values of l, r, s, and ops remain unchanged.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: *l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers. If the index of the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive) is not equal to l, then the sum of the elements in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive) is greater than (pos - 1 - l + 1) * (pos - 1 - l + 1), and the maximum value in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive) is the value at index pos in a, and a value has been returned. Otherwise, no changes have been made.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: The function either returns the result of the recursive call with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, or does not make any changes, depending on whether the index of the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is equal to `r` or not. In both cases, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the sum and maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) are still satisfied.
    #State: `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers. If the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray, the subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is modified to contain the value `r - l + 1` at each index. Otherwise, the function either returns the result of the recursive call with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, or does not make any changes, depending on whether the index of the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is equal to `r` or not. In both cases, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the sum and maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) are still satisfied.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
