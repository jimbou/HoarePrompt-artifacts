Output State: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and the value returned by this function is returned. The values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` are unchanged. The index of the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is still not equal to `l`. The sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) is still greater than `(pos - 1 - l + 1) * (pos - 1 - l + 1)`, and the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) is still the value at index `pos` in `a`. The current value of `pos` is still not equal to `r`.**

In natural language, the code calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the next position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`, and returns the result. The state of the variables `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` remains the same, and the conditions about the maximum value and sum of elements in `a` are still satisfied.
