Postcondition: **The function either returns the result of the recursive call with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, or does not make any changes, depending on whether the index of the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is equal to `r` or not. In both cases, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `pos` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the sum and maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive) are still satisfied.**
