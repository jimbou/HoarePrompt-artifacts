Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a, but the program does not correctly achieve this goal.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains a large number of zeros. In this case, the program's recursive approach may lead to an exponential number of operations, exceeding the limit of 5*10^5 operations specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the input array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The program's recursive approach will lead to an exponential number of operations, exceeding the limit of 5*10^5 operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the elements of the array a for all potential cases, and it exceeds the limit of 5*10^5 operations in certain cases.
