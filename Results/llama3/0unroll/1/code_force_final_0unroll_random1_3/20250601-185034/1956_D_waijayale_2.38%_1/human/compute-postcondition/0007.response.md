Postcondition: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a from index l to r (inclusive), and s is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), mx is the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive), and pos is the index of mx in a. The current value of pos is not equal to l.**
