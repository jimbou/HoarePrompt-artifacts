Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX.

The program consists of four functions:

1.  `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`: This function is a recursive function that performs the operation on the subarray from l to r. It first checks if l is equal to r. If so, it checks if the element at index l is not equal to 0. If it's not equal to 0, it appends the operation (l, l) to the list of operations and sets the element at index l to 0. Then it returns. If l is not equal to r, it calls itself recursively with l + 1 and r. Then it checks if the element at index l is not equal to r - l + 1. If it's not equal, it appends the operation (l, r) to the list of operations, sets all elements in the subarray from l to r to r - l + 1, and calls itself recursively with l + 1 and r.

2.  `func_2(a)`: This function takes an array a as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum sum of elements in the array, the number of operations performed, and the list of operations. It first initializes an empty list of operations. Then it calls the `recursive_maximize_sum` function with 0 and n - 1 (where n is the length of the array) and returns the result.

3.  `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`: This function is a recursive function that maximizes the sum of elements in the subarray from l to r. It first calculates the sum of elements in the subarray. If the sum is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) \* (r - l + 1), it calls `func_1` with l, r, and the list of operations, appends the operation (l, r) to the list of operations, and sets all elements in the subarray to r - l + 1. If the sum is greater than (r - l + 1) \* (r - l + 1), it finds the maximum element in the subarray and its position. If the position is not equal to l, it calls itself recursively with l and pos - 1. If the position is not equal to r, it calls itself recursively with pos + 1 and r.

4.  `func_3()`: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` with the input array, and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of elements in the array by performing the specified operation. It uses a recursive approach to divide the array into subarrays and maximize the sum of each subarray. The `func_1` function correctly performs the operation on a subarray, and the `recursive_maximize_sum` function correctly decides whether to perform the operation on a subarray or divide it further.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

*   The `func_2` function does not correctly initialize the `ops` list. It should be initialized as an empty list inside the function.
*   The `recursive_maximize_sum` function does not correctly access the `a` and `ops` variables. It should be defined inside the `func_2` function to access these variables correctly.
*   The `func_3` function does not correctly print the operations. It should print the operations in the format specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
