Output State: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive), and s is greater than (pos - 1 - l + 1) * (pos - 1 - l + 1), mx is the maximum value in a from index l to pos - 1 (inclusive), and pos is the index of mx in a. The current value of pos is not equal to l, and a value has been returned.**

In this output state, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the arguments `l` and `pos - 1`, which means that the function is now considering the subarray from index `l` to `pos - 1` (inclusive). The sum `s` is now the sum of the elements in this subarray, and it is still greater than the square of the length of this subarray. The maximum value `mx` is now the maximum value in this subarray, and its index `pos` is still not equal to `l`. Additionally, a value has been returned from the function call.
