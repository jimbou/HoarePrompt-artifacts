Functionality: **The function reads two inputs from stdin: a positive integer n (n <= 18) and a space-separated list of n non-negative integers (each <= 10^7). It then processes this list, producing an integer s, an integer m, and a list of pairs (l, r). The function prints the values of s and m, followed by the values of l and r for each pair in the list.**
