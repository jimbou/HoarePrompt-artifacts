The code prints the values of the variables `s` and `m`. Since the exact values of `s` and `m` are not provided in the initial state, we can't determine their exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `s` and `m` as they are defined in the program.

Output: **s (where s is an integer), m (where m is an integer)**
