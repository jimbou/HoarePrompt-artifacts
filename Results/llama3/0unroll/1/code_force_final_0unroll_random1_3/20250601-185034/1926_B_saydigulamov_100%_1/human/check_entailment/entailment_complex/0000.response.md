Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether the grid contains a square or a triangle based on the number of '1's in the first two lines. If the number of '1's in the first two lines are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This logic is correct because a square will always have the same number of '1's in each row, while a triangle will have a different number of '1's in each row.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It then processes the grid and prints the result.

The program also correctly handles the case where the grid contains a triangle or a square that is not aligned with the top-left corner of the grid. This is because it only checks the number of '1's in the first two lines, which will always be the same for a square and different for a triangle, regardless of the alignment of the shape.

Correctness: **True**
