Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a lines each containing a characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, which is obtained from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been partially processed, with only the first line (containing the integer `a`) being read. The remaining lines of the first test case, as well as the remaining test cases, are still in the stdin. The grid described in the problem statement still contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is still greater than 1.
