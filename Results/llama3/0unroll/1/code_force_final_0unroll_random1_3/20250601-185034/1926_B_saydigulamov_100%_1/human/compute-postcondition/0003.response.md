Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a grid of '0's and '1's. It determines whether the grid contains a square or a triangle based on the number of '1's in the first two lines and prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' accordingly. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases, ranging from 2 to 10, and outputs the results to standard output.**
