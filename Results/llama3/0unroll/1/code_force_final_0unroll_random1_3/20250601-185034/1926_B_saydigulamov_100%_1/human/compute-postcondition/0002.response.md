Output State: The loop has executed 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive. For each execution, it has read 'a' lines from the standard input, where each line contains a string of '0's and '1's. It has then checked if the number of '1's in the first two lines are equal. If they are equal, it has printed 'SQUARE', otherwise it has printed 'TRIANGLE'. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of 'a' number of lines printed to the standard output, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE'.
