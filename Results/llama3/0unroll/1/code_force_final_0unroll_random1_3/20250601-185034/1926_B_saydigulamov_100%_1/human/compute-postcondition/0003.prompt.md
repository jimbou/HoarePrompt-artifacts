You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive. For each execution, it has read 'a' lines from the standard input, where each line contains a string of '0's and '1's. It has then checked if the number of '1's in the first two lines are equal. If they are equal, it has printed 'SQUARE', otherwise it has printed 'TRIANGLE'. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of 'a' number of lines printed to the standard output, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE'.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
