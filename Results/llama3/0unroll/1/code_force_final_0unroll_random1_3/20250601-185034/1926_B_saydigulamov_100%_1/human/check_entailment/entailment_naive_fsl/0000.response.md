Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
000
011
011
```

The program will output "SQUARE", but the correct output should be "TRIANGLE". This is because the shape in the grid is a triangle, not a square.

The program does not take into account the position of the '1's in the grid, which is necessary to determine the shape. It only checks the number of '1's in each row, which is not enough to correctly identify the shape.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check the position of the '1's in the grid and verify that they form a square or a triangle according to the problem description.
