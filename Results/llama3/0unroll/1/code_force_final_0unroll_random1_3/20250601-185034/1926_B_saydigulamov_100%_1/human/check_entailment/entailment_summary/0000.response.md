Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies whether the grid contains a square or a triangle based on the number of '1's in the first two lines. If the number of '1's in the first two lines is the same, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This logic is correct according to the problem description, which states that a square has the same number of '1's in each row, while a triangle has a different number of '1's in each row.

Correctness: **True**
