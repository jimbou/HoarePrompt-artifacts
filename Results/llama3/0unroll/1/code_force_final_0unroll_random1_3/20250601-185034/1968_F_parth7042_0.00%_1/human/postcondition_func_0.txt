This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by calculating the prefix XOR of the list of integers and storing the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. For each query pair (l, r), it checks if there exists an index i such that l <= i <= r and the XOR of the prefix up to i is equal to the XOR of the prefix up to r. If such an index exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, with each result on a separate line.
