Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: an integer t, two integers n and q, and a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. t is an integer, idx is 1, results is an empty list.**

The first line reads the first input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, assigning it to the variable `data`. The second line initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The third line converts the first element of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`, then increments `idx` by 1. The fourth line initializes an empty list `results`. 

The value of `t` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `idx` is 1. The list `results` is empty. The state of stdin is unchanged, as only the first input has been read.
