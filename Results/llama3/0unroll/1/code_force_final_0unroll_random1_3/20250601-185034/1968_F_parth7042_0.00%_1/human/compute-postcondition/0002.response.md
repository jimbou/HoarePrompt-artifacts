Based on the precondition, the `results` variable contains the answers to all the test cases. The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

Therefore, the output will be a string containing all the answers to the test cases, each on a separate line.

Output: **the answers to all the test cases, each on a separate line**
