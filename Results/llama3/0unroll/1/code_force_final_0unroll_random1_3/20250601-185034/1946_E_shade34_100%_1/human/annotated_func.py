#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The first value is an integer equal to 1. The second value is an integer equal to 0, which is also the initial value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`. `c` is the first return value of the function `func_1(b, a)` with the same input values.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1. The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1, where a is a multiple of b and a is not less than b.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`. The value of `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which is an integer because `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the result in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the second return value of func_1 and the first return value of func_1 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and 'c', which is the return value of func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' as input and returns the product of 'a' and the result of another function 'func_1' called with 'b' and a large prime number (1000000007), modulo 1000000007.
