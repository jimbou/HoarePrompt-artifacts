Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`. The value of `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which is an integer because `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.**
