Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is not less than `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. The code only assigns the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)` to `c` and `d`, respectively. The conditions that `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b` are still valid as they are not affected by the code.
