Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` appears to be calculating the modular multiplicative inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm, while `func_2` uses this inverse to perform modular multiplication.

However, there is no main function or code that actually solves the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used anywhere in the program. Therefore, the program does not provide a solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
