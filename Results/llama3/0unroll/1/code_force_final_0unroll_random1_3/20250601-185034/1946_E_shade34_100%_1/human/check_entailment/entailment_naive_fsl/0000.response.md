Correctness: **False**.

The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem. The problem description requires the program to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. However, the provided program only contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but do not address the main problem.

The program does not take into account the input values `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_m1`, `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_m2` and does not perform any calculations to determine the number of suitable permutations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
