You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The first value is an integer equal to 1. The second value is an integer equal to 0, which is also the initial value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`. `c` is the first return value of the function `func_1(b, a)` with the same input values.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1. The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1, where a is a multiple of b and a is not less than b.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`. The value of `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which is an integer because `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The first value is an integer equal to 1. The second value is an integer equal to 0, which is also the initial value of variable b.

Case_2: The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`. `c` is the first return value of the function `func_1(b, a)` with the same input values.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1. The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1, where a is a multiple of b and a is not less than b.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`. The value of `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which is an integer because `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
