Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The first value is an integer equal to 1. The second value is an integer equal to 0, which is also the initial value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`. `c` is the first return value of the function `func_1(b, a)` with the same input values.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1. The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the result of the integer division of a by b minus 1, where a is a multiple of b and a is not less than b.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`. The value of `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which is an integer because `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the result in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the second return value of func_1 and the first return value of func_1 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and 'c', which is the return value of func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' as input and returns the product of 'a' and the result of another function 'func_1' called with 'b' and a large prime number (1000000007), modulo 1000000007.
