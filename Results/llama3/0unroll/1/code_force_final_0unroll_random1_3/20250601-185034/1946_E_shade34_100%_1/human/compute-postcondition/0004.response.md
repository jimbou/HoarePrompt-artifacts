Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1(b, a)` for the first return value, `d` is the value returned by `func_1(b, a)` for the second return value.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`, and assigns the returned values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The values of `c` and `d` are now determined by the return values of `func_1(b, a)`. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`.
