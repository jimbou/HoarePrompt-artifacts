Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code assigns the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to `c` and `d`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can conclude that `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1` with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments.
