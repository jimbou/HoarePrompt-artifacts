Functionality: **This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the result in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the second return value of func_1 and the first return value of func_1 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.**
