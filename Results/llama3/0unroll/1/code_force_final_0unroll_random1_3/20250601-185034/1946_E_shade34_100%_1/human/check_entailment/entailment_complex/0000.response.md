Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and prefix/suffix maximums. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

After analyzing the code, I found that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly defined and used to calculate the modular inverses and combinations, respectively.

The main part of the program correctly reads the input, checks the validity of the input, and calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function. The program also correctly handles the cases where the input is invalid or the number of suitable permutations is zero.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
