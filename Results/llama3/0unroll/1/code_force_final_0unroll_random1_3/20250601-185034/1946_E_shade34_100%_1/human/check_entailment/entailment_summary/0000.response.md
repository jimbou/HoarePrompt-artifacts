Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first calculates the factorial of numbers up to 200002 and stores them in the `facts` list. This is done to efficiently calculate the combinations (nCr) later in the program.

2. The program then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

3. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums (`p`) and the suffix maximums (`s`).

4. The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, because in such cases, there are no valid permutations.

5. If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of valid permutations. It does this by iterating over the suffix maximums and calculating the combinations (nCr) for each suffix maximum. The combinations are calculated using the `func_2` function, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.

6. After calculating the combinations for the suffix maximums, the program calculates the combinations for the prefix maximums in reverse order.

7. Finally, the program calculates the total number of valid permutations by multiplying the combinations for the prefix and suffix maximums, and the factorials of the differences between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

8. The program prints the total number of valid permutations modulo 1000000007.

The `func_1` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The `func_2` function uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the modular multiplication.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given problem description, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the necessary mathematical operations.
