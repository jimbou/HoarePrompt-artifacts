Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. It uses the concept of combinatorics and modular arithmetic to calculate the result.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0.

Otherwise, it calculates the result by multiplying the number of combinations for each suffix maximum and prefix maximum, and then multiplying the result by the factorial of the difference between each prefix maximum and the previous one, and the factorial of the difference between each suffix maximum and the previous one.

The program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular inverse of a number, and the `func_2` function to calculate the product of a number and its modular inverse.

The program correctly handles the case where the input values are valid, and it correctly calculates the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
