#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the value of f after the for loop. The value of t will be 0 after the loop finishes.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a set of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value 'f' based on the given integers and their differences, and then prints 'YES' if 'f' is positive and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the input 't'.
