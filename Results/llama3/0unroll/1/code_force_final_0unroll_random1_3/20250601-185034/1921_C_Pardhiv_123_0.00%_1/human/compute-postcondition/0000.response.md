Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, where n is a positive integer, and f, a, and b are positive integers. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.
