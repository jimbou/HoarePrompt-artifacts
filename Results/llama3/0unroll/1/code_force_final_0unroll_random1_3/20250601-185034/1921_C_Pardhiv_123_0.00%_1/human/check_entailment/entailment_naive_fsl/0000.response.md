Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through the list of message sending moments, calculates the minimum charge consumption between each pair of moments (either by keeping the phone on or by turning it off and on), and subtracts this consumption from the initial phone charge. If the remaining charge is greater than 0 after all messages have been sent, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages without turning it off and on, and the case where the phone's charge is not sufficient and needs to be turned off and on to conserve energy. The program also handles the case where the phone's charge is 0 or negative, in which case it prints "NO".

The program does not have any integer overflow issues, as it uses Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic, which can handle large integers without overflowing.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
