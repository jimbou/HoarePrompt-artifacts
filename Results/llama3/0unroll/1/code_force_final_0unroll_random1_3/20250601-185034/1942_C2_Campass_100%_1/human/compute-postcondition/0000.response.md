Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.**

The first line defines a lambda function R that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object. The second line reads an integer t from stdin using the R function and assigns it to the variable t. Since t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t becomes an integer equal to its original value minus 1. No other variables are affected.
