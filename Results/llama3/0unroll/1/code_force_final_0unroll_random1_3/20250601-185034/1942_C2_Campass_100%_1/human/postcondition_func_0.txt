This function calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in a list equal to the median of the list. It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the result for each case. The function takes no parameters and returns the number of operations required, which is the sum of the number of elements in the list and the sum of the differences between each element and the median, minus 2.
