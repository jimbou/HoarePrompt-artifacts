Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a list of non-zero integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
