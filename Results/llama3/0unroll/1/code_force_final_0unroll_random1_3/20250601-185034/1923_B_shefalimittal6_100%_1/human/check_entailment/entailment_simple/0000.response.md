Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from the character using the `sorted_indices` list. This is because the `abs(x[i])` function returns the absolute value of the distance, which is the correct way to measure the distance from the character.

2. The program then iterates over the sorted monsters, and for each monster, it checks if the monster is at the current distance `distance`. If it is, the program immediately returns `False`, indicating that the character cannot survive.

3. If the monster is not at the current distance, the program tries to kill the monster by firing bullets at it. The number of bullets fired is the minimum of the remaining bullets `rest` and the monster's health `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. This is the correct way to simulate the firing of bullets.

4. After firing bullets at the current monster, the program increments the distance `distance` by 1, which simulates the monsters moving closer to the character.

5. The program repeats steps 2-4 until all monsters have been processed. If all monsters have been killed (i.e., `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`), the program returns `True`, indicating that the character can survive.

6. The main function `func_2` correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` with the correct arguments, and prints the result.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
