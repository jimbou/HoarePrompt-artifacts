Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character. The function `func_1` sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character and then iterates through them, firing bullets at the closest monsters first. It keeps track of the distance and the number of bullets fired, and returns False as soon as it encounters a monster that is closer than the distance, indicating that the character cannot survive.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the number of bullets is not enough to kill all monsters, the case where the monsters are at the same distance, and the case where the monsters are at different distances. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of bullets is greater than the number of monsters.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character. The function `func_1` correctly sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character and then iterates through them, firing bullets at the closest monsters first. The program correctly handles all potential cases and returns the correct result.

In conclusion, the program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character, and it correctly handles all potential cases.
