This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n'. For each test case, it finds the maximum value 'k' and the second maximum value 'best' by querying the input in a specific format. It then prints the maximum value 'k' and the second maximum value 'best' for each test case in the format '! k best'. The function iterates over all test cases, and its final state is the output of the maximum and second maximum values for each test case.
