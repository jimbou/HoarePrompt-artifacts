    #The program returns a positive integer that was input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string of two space-separated integers.
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers that were input as a string of two space-separated integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of two space-separated integers from standard input, splits the string into two integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of input with two space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
    #The program returns a list of two integers that were provided as input through stdin, separated by a space.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows_number is a positive integer.
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
    #The program returns a list of 'rows_number' number of elements, where each element is the result of the function 'func_3()'. Since 'rows_number' is a positive integer, the list will have at least one element. The actual values in the list depend on the implementation of 'func_3()'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a list of elements by repeatedly calling 'func_3()' a specified number of times, equal to the value of 'rows_number', and returns this list. The list will contain at least one element, as 'rows_number' is a positive integer. The actual content of the list is determined by the results of 'func_3()' calls.

    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of two integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of two integers from the input, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows is a positive integer
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list containing the result of func_7() repeated 'rows' times, where 'rows' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces.
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is the input provided by the user.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is the input provided by the user. The function does not perform any actions on the input, it simply returns the input as is.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a positive integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a positive integer that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or additional processing.

    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer, separated by a space.

#Overall this is what the function does:Takes a string of two space-separated positive integers as input, splits it into two substrings at the space separator, and returns them as a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer and a key in d, and rank is a list of integers. The length of processing and rank is equal to the maximum key in d.

    #State: The value of `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and the value of `processing` remains unchanged because it is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration. The values of `d`, `da`, and `rank` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp` plus 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. This value is also equal to the value of `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, integer `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, checks the value of `processing[di - 1]`, and if it's 0, it calls the function `func_12` and updates the `tmp` value with the minimum returned value. After the iteration, it updates the `rank[da - 1]` value with `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.

    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. y is a value returned by func_13(b, a % b), x - a // b * y is the difference between x, another value returned by func_13(b, a % b), and the product of a // b and y, and g is the third value returned by func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 with b and a % b, and returns the result with the coefficients adjusted accordingly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that n is the length of list a, and k is an integer.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a non-negative integer `m`, and an integer `k` as input. It iterates through the list `a` and subtracts the difference between `m` and each element `a[i]` from `k` if `a[i]` is less than `m`. The function then returns 1 if the updated value of `k` is non-negative, indicating that the sum of the differences between `m` and the elements of `a` that are less than `m` does not exceed the initial value of `k`. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the sum of the differences exceeds the initial value of `k`.

    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by the square of all integers from 1 to the square root of n, minus 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + i) by the square of all integers from 1 to the square root of n, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and returns this sum minus 1.
