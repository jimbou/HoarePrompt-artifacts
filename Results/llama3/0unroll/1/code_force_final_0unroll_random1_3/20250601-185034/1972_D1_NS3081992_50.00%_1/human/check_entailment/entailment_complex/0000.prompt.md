Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a positive integer.
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
    #The program returns a positive integer that was input from stdin.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string of two space-separated integers.
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers that were input as a string of two space-separated integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of two space-separated integers from standard input, splits the string into two integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of input with two space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
    #The program returns a list of two integers that were provided as input through stdin, separated by a space.

    #The program returns a list of 'rows_number' number of elements, where each element is the result of the function 'func_3()'. Since 'rows_number' is a positive integer, the list will have at least one element. The actual values in the list depend on the implementation of 'func_3()'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a list of elements by repeatedly calling 'func_3()' a specified number of times, equal to the value of 'rows_number', and returns this list. The list will contain at least one element, as 'rows_number' is a positive integer. The actual content of the list is determined by the results of 'func_3()' calls.

    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list containing the result of func_7() repeated 'rows' times, where 'rows' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces.
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is the input provided by the user.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is the input provided by the user. The function does not perform any actions on the input, it simply returns the input as is.

#Function 10:

    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer, separated by a space.

#Overall this is what the function does:Takes a string of two space-separated positive integers as input, splits it into two substrings at the space separator, and returns them as a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer and a key in d, and rank is a list of integers. The length of processing and rank is equal to the maximum key in d.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer and a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of `processing` and `rank` is equal to the maximum key in `d`. The length of the list `d[da]` is more than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: The value of `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and the value of `processing` remains unchanged because it is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration. The values of `d`, `da`, and `rank` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp` plus 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. This value is also equal to the value of `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, integer `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, checks the value of `processing[di - 1]`, and if it's 0, it calls the function `func_12` and updates the `tmp` value with the minimum returned value. After the iteration, it updates the `rank[da - 1]` value with `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns a tuple containing three values: x which is 1, y which is 0, and a which is a positive integer.
    #State: a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. y is a value returned by func_13(b, a % b), x - a // b * y is the difference between x, another value returned by func_13(b, a % b), and the product of a // b and y, and g is the third value returned by func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 with b and a % b, and returns the result with the coefficients adjusted accordingly.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that n is the length of list a, and k is an integer.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: a is a list of integers, n is the length of list a, m is a non-negative integer, and k is an integer such that k is the initial value of k minus the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range n where a[i] is less than m.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a non-negative integer `m`, and an integer `k` as input. It iterates through the list `a` and subtracts the difference between `m` and each element `a[i]` from `k` if `a[i]` is less than `m`. The function then returns 1 if the updated value of `k` is non-negative, indicating that the sum of the differences between `m` and the elements of `a` that are less than `m` does not exceed the initial value of `k`. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the sum of the differences exceeds the initial value of `k`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and n and m are the output of function func_7().
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, ans is the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by the square of all integers from 1 to the square root of n.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by the square of all integers from 1 to the square root of n, minus 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + i) by the square of all integers from 1 to the square root of n, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a non-negative integer, and the function func_15() returns a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The standard output contains a sequence of strings, each on a new line, where the number of strings is equal to the return value of func_10(). Each string is the return value of func_15().

#Overall this is what the function does:This function writes a sequence of strings to the standard output, where the number of strings is determined by the return value of func_10() and each string is the return value of func_15(). The strings are written one per line.
