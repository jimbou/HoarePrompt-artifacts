This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 with b and a % b, and returns the result with the coefficients adjusted accordingly.
