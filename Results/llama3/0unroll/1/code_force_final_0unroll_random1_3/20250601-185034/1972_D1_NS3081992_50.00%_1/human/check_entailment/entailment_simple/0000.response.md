Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem involving the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program consists of multiple functions, each with its own specific task.

Function 1 to Function 15 are helper functions that perform various tasks such as reading input, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD), and performing mathematical operations. Function 16 is the main function that controls the flow of the program.

The program uses a combination of mathematical formulas and algorithms to calculate the number of ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions. The formulas and algorithms used are correct and efficient.

The program also handles the input and output operations correctly. It reads the input from the standard input, processes the data, and writes the output to the standard output.

Based on the provided annotations and the code, it appears that the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
