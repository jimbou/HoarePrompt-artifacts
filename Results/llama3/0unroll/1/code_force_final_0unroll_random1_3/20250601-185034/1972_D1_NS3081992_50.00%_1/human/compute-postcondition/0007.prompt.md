You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer and a key in d, and rank is a list of integers. The length of processing and rank is equal to the maximum key in d.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer and a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of `processing` and `rank` is equal to the maximum key in `d`. The length of the list `d[da]` is more than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: The value of `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and the value of `processing` remains unchanged because it is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration. The values of `d`, `da`, and `rank` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp` plus 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. This value is also equal to the value of `rank[da - 1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 1.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `tmp` plus 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each iteration of the loop where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. This value is also equal to the value of `rank[da - 1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
