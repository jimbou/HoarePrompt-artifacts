Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n-1 integers. It then generates a new list a of length n, where the first element is always 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the input list. The function prints the generated list a for each test case.**
