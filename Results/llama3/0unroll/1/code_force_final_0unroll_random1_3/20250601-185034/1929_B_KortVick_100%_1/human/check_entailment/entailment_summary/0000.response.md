Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

If k is equal to 4n - 2, which means all diagonals need to be colored, the program prints k // 2 + 1. This is because each diagonal has two cells that can be colored, and we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal. Since k is equal to 4n - 2, we can color one cell in each of the 2n - 1 diagonals that have an odd number of cells, and one cell in each of the 2n - 1 diagonals that have an even number of cells. This requires a total of (2n - 1) + (2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 2 cells, which is equal to k.

If k is not equal to 4n - 2, the program prints the ceiling of k / 2. This is because we can color one cell in each of the k / 2 diagonals that have an odd number of cells, and one cell in each of the k / 2 diagonals that have an even number of cells. Since k is not equal to 4n - 2, we may not need to color all diagonals, and the ceiling of k / 2 gives us the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

The program correctly handles the two cases and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
