The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two space-separated integers: n and k, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two space-separated integers: n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.**
