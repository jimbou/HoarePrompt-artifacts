Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., k = 4n - 2), then the minimum number of cells to be colored is k // 2 + 1. This is because each diagonal has n cells, and we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal. Since there are k // 2 diagonals in each direction (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left), we need to color k // 2 + 1 cells.

- If not all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., k < 4n - 2), then the minimum number of cells to be colored is ceil(k / 2). This is because we can color cells in a way that each cell is on two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). Therefore, we need to color at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

This logic is correct, and the program implements it correctly.

Correctness: **True**
