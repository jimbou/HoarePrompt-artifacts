The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers, n and k, and outputs the number of lines equal to the number of test cases. For each test case, if k is equal to 4n - 2, it prints k // 2 + 1; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k / 2.
