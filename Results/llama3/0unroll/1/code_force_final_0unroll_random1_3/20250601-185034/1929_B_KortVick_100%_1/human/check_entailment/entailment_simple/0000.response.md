Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

The program first checks if k is equal to 4n - 2, which is the total number of diagonals in the grid. If this is the case, it prints k // 2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover all diagonals.

If k is not equal to 4n - 2, the program prints the ceiling of k / 2. This is because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and the ceiling function ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number in case k is odd.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the total number of diagonals in the grid and the minimum number of cells needed to cover them. The use of the ceiling function ensures that we always round up to the nearest whole number, which is necessary because we can't color a fraction of a cell.

Correctness: **True**
