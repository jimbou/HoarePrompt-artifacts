This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It then calculates and prints the number of alternating sequences of '0's and '1's in each string, subtracting 1 if the string starts with '0' and ends with '1'. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console, leaving the input variable t unchanged.
