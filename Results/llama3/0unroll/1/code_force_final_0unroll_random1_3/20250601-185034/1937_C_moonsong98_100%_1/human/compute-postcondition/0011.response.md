Output State: **`max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` remains unchanged, `min_indices` is a list containing all the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be the smallest index in the list `min_indices`. The other variables, `max_index` and `n`, remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` still contains all the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<'.
