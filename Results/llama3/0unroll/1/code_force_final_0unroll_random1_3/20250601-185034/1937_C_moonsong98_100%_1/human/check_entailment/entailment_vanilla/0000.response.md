Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the interactive problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` is used to ask a query and get the result, `func_2` is used to print the answer, and `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.

2. In `func_3`, the program first reads the number of elements `n` in the permutation. If `n` is 2, it directly prints the answer as `0 1` because for `n=2`, `p` is either `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and in both cases, `p_0 ⊕ p_1 = 1` is the maximum possible value.

3. For `n > 2`, the program first finds the index `max_index` of the maximum element in the permutation. It does this by comparing each element with the current maximum element using `func_1` and updating `max_index` if a larger element is found.

4. After finding `max_index`, the program finds the indices of the minimum elements in the permutation. It does this by comparing each element with the current minimum element using `func_1` and updating the list of minimum indices if a smaller element is found.

5. The program then finds the index `min_index` of the minimum element among the minimum indices. It does this by comparing each minimum index with the current minimum index using `func_1` and updating `min_index` if a smaller element is found.

6. Finally, the program prints the answer as `max_index` and `min_index` using `func_2`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program correctly finds the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
