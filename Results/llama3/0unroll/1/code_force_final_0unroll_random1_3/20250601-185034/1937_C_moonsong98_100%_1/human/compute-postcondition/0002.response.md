Output State: **`n` is an integer and equals 2, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_2` has been called with arguments 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as 2, and stdin still contains no input. The code snippet calls the function `func_2` with arguments 0 and 1, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the outcome of the function call. However, we can confirm that the function has been called with the specified arguments.
