Output State: **`min_index` is the smallest index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns '='.**

The code `func_2(max_index, min_index)` does not affect the value of `min_index` because it is a function call that does not modify the value of `min_index`. The function `func_2` may have some side effects, but based on the given information, it does not change the value of `min_index`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
