You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty, and no value or variable is being returned. The state of the program remains unchanged, with n still equal to 2, stdin containing no input, and the function func_2 having been called with arguments 0 and 1.
    #State: *n is an integer, stdin contains no input, and n is not equal to 2
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            max_index = i
        
    #State: Output State: `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` remains unchanged.
    min_indices = [max_index]
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            min_indices = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            min_indices.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` remains unchanged, `min_indices` is a list containing all the indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<'.
    min_index = min_indices[0]
    for i in min_indices:
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        
        res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
        
        if res == '=':
            min_index = i
        
    #State: Output State: `min_index` is the smallest index `i` in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns '='.
    func_2(max_index, min_index)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty, and no value or variable is being returned. The state of the program remains unchanged, with n still equal to 2, stdin containing no input, and the function func_2 having been called with arguments 0 and 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
