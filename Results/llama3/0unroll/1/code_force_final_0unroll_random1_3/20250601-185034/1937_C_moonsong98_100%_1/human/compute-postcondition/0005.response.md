Output State: **`n` is an integer and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `max_index` and assigned it the value 0. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing no input.
