Output State: **`max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` remains unchanged, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.**

In this output state, the value of `max_index` and `n` remains the same as in the initial state. However, a new variable `min_indices` is introduced, which is a list containing the value of `max_index`. This means that `min_indices` now holds the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.
