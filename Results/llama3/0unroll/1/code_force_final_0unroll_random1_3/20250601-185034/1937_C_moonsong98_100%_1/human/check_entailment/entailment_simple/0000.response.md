Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The program uses a combination of queries to the jury and comparisons to achieve this goal.

The program first checks if the length of the secret sequence `n` is 2. If it is, the program directly outputs the pair of indices `(0, 1)` as the answer, since for `n=2`, the maximum XOR value can be obtained by taking the two elements of the sequence.

If `n` is not 2, the program proceeds to find the maximum index `max_index` by comparing the results of queries `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`. The maximum index is the one for which the query returns `<`.

Next, the program finds the minimum indices `min_indices` by comparing the results of queries `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`. The minimum indices are the ones for which the query returns `<` or `=`.

The program then finds the smallest minimum index `min_index` by comparing the results of queries `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` for all `i` in `min_indices`. The smallest minimum index is the one for which the query returns `=`.

Finally, the program outputs the pair of indices `(max_index, min_index)` as the answer.

The program uses at most `3n` queries to the jury, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
