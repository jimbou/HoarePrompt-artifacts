This function takes a positive integer n as input and performs a series of operations using two external functions, func_1 and func_2. If n is 2, it calls func_2 with arguments 0 and 1 and returns without changing the state of the program. If n is greater than 2, it iterates through the range of n to find the maximum index i for which func_1 returns '<', and then finds all indices i for which func_1 returns '=' or '<' with respect to the maximum index. It then finds the smallest index i among these that returns '=' when compared to itself using func_1. Finally, it calls func_2 with the maximum index and the smallest index as arguments, without returning any value or changing the state of the program.
