#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of t remains unchanged, cases becomes an empty list, results is a list of pairs where the first element of each pair is 25 and the second element is the list sequence, and sequence remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of pairs where the first element of each pair is 25 and the second element is the list sequence, and the value of t remains unchanged, cases becomes an empty list, and sequence remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) as input and returns a list of pairs where each pair contains the integer 25 and a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The input list is emptied, and the original value of a separate variable t remains unchanged.
