Functionality: This function generates a list of pairs, where each pair contains the number 25 and a list of powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^24), and returns this list. The function takes in a list of cases, which is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k), but does not use the values of n and k in its computation. The function does not modify the input variables t and sequence, but empties the list of cases.
