Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding a sequence a of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of a with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v. However, the program simply generates a sequence of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24 for each test case, regardless of the values of n and k. This sequence does not guarantee that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and it does not ensure that there is a subsequence with a sum of v for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k.

Correctness: **False**
