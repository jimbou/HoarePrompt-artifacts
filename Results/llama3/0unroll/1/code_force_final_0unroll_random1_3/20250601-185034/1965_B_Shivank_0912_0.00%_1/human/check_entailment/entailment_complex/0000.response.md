Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The provided function, func_1, generates a sequence of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24 and returns this sequence for every input pair (n, k). This sequence has a size of 25, which meets the problem's constraint.

However, the function does not consider the specific values of n and k when generating the sequence. It simply returns the same sequence of powers of 2 for every input pair. This means that the function does not guarantee that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, nor does it ensure that there is a subsequence with a sum of v for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k.

In fact, the function's output does not depend on the input values of n and k at all. This suggests that the function is not correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
