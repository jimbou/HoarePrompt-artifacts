Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets certain conditions. The program reads input from the standard input, processes it, and then prints the results.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not actually solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` simply returns a fixed sequence of 25 numbers, which are powers of 2, for every test case. This sequence does not take into account the values of `n` and `k` provided in the input.

The problem statement requires that the sequence should not have a subsequence that sums up to `k`, and for all `v` between 1 and `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums up to `v`. The program does not make any attempt to ensure that these conditions are met.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and it does not provide a valid solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
