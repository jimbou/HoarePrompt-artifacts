Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking the parity of the dimensions of the rectangle and the difference between them. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect.

The program first checks if both `a` and `b` are even, and if so, prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because if both `a` and `b` are even, it does not necessarily mean that another rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, both are even, but another rectangle cannot be formed.

The program then checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, and if so, prints 'yes'. This is also incorrect because if the difference is odd, it does not necessarily mean that another rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 2`, the difference is odd, but another rectangle cannot be formed.

The program also checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, and if so, prints 'no'. This condition is not clear and does not seem to be related to the problem.

The correct solution to the problem is to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means that `a` and `b` have a common factor, and therefore, another rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
