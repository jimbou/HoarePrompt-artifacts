Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines, each containing either 'yes' or 'no'. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases. For each test case, if both a and b are even, the output will be 'yes'. If the difference between a and b is odd, the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'no'.**
