Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The rest of the inputs in stdin remain unchanged, containing t pairs of space-separated integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 99.
