Functionality: **Reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer 't' representing the number of subsequent inputs, and each subsequent input is a pair of integers 'x' and 'y'. For each pair, calculates and prints an integer 'z' based on 'x' and 'y', without modifying the original values of 'x' and 'y'. The function prints 't' number of lines, each containing a single integer 'z', and leaves the original values of 'x' and 'y' unchanged.**
