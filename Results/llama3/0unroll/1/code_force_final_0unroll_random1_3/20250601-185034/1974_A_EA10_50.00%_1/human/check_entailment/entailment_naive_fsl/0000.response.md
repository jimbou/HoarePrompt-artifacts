Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is (0, 3), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 2 because 3 2x2 icons can fit in 2 screens (with one screen having only 2 icons and the other screen having only 1 icon, but the remaining space in the first screen can fit 2 more 1x1 icons, but since there are no 1x1 icons, it can fit 2 more 2x2 icons but since there is only 1 more 2x2 icon it can fit in the first screen).
