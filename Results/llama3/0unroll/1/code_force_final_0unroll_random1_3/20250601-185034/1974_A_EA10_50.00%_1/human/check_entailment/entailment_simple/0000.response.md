Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.
3. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the expression `(y + 1) // 2`. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to account for the remaining cells in the last screen.
4. It calculates the remaining cells in the last screen that are not occupied by 2x2 icons using the expression `15 * z - y * 4`. This is because each screen has 15 cells, and we subtract the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
5. If the remaining cells are less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the 1x1 icons using the expression `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This is because each screen can accommodate up to 15 icons, and we need to account for the remaining icons.
6. Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed, which is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there are no 2x2 icons or no 1x1 icons, and when the number of icons is a multiple of 15.

Correctness: **True**
