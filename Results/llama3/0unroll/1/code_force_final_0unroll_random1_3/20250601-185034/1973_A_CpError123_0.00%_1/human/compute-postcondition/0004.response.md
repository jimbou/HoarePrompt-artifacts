Functionality: **This function takes a list of lists of three integers each as input, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of possible draws in a series of matches, given the total points earned by each team. If the total points are odd or if the number of matches is invalid, it returns -1 for that case. Otherwise, it returns the number of draws, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 15. The function returns a list of these results, one for each case in the input list.**
