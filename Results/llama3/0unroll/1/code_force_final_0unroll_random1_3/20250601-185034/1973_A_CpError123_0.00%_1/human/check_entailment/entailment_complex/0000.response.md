Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess matches between three friends, given their scores. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the total points earned by all players, and checks if the total points are odd or if the number of matches is invalid. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and appends the result to the list.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. The use of the formula to calculate the number of draws is also correct, as it takes into account the points earned by each player and the fact that a draw results in 1 point for each player.

However, there is a small issue in the annotated program. The test case `(0, 2, 3)` is not present in the original problem description, and the program's output for this case is not provided. Nevertheless, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
