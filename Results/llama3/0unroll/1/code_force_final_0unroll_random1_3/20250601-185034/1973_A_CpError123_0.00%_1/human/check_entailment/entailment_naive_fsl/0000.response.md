Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case (0, 2, 3). According to the problem description, the scores should be achievable by a non-negative number of games between the three players. However, the program returns -1 for this case, which is incorrect.

The issue is that the program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the maximum score is greater than the total number of matches. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the scores are achievable. A more thorough analysis of the problem is required to determine the correctness of the program.

For example, the case (0, 2, 3) can be achieved by the following sequence of games:

* Player 1 plays against Player 2 and loses (0-2)
* Player 2 plays against Player 3 and wins (2-3)
* Player 1 plays against Player 3 and loses (0-3)

This sequence of games results in the scores (0, 2, 3), which is a valid outcome according to the problem description. Therefore, the program should return a value other than -1 for this case.

In conclusion, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
