Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess matches between three friends, given their scores. The program checks for invalid inputs, such as an odd total number of points or an invalid number of matches, and returns -1 in these cases. Otherwise, it calculates the number of draws based on the total points earned by each player and the number of matches played.

Correctness: **True**
