Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes as input a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players.

The program first checks if the total number of points is odd, in which case it is impossible to achieve the given scores and the program outputs -1. It then calculates the total number of matches played, which is half the total number of points.

The program then checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score is greater than the total number of matches. If either of these conditions is true, it is impossible to achieve the given scores and the program outputs -1.

If the program passes these checks, it calculates the number of draws by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score and the second-highest score, and twice the difference between the highest score and the lowest score, from the total number of points. This gives the total number of points that were not won or lost, which must have been drawn.

The program then checks if the calculated number of draws is negative, in which case it is impossible to achieve the given scores and the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated number of draws divided by 2, since each draw counts as 1 point for each player.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
