Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list**.

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer, the list `cas_de_test` remains unchanged with its sublists containing three integers each between 0 and 30 inclusive and sorted in non-decreasing order. A new variable `resultats` is introduced and is assigned an empty list.
