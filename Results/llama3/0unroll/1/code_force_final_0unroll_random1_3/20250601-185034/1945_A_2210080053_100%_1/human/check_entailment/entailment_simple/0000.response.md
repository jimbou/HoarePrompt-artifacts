Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly parses the input into three integers: a (introverts), b (extroverts), and c (universals).
3. The program then adds the number of universals (c) to the number of extroverts (b). This is because universals can be treated as extroverts when it comes to tent allocation.
4. The program then calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals. This is done by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals (b + c) by 3 and taking the ceiling of the result (using the `- -b // 3` trick). This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
5. The program then checks if the number of universals (c) is less than the remainder of the sum of extroverts and universals (b + c) divided by 3. If this is the case, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, and the program outputs -1.
6. Otherwise, the program outputs the number of introverts (a) minus the integer division of the sum of extroverts and universals (b + c) by 3. This is because each introvert needs their own tent, and the remaining tents can be used to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
