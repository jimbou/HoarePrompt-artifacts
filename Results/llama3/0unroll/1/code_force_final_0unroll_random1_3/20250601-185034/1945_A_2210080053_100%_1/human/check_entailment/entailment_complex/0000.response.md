Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, skipping the first line that contains the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly parses the three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
3. It correctly calculates the total number of extroverts and universals by adding `b` and `c`.
4. It correctly checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder of the total extroverts and universals divided by 3. If this condition is true, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.
5. If the condition is false, it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the integer division of the total extroverts and universals by 3 from the number of introverts. This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, and the introverts need to be accommodated separately.
6. The program correctly outputs one integer per test case, resulting in a total of `t` lines of output, where `t` is the number of test cases specified in the first line of input.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
