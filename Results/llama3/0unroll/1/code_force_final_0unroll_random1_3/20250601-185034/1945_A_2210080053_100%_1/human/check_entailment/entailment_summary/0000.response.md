Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly parses the three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
3. It calculates the total number of extroverts and universals by adding `b` and `c`, which is correct because universals can be treated as extroverts.
4. It calculates the number of tents needed for the introverts, which is simply `a`.
5. It calculates the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals by dividing the total number of extroverts and universals by 3 and taking the integer part. This is correct because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
6. It checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder of the total extroverts and universals divided by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, so it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the total number of tents needed.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
