#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sides of a triangle.
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True if the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and False otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether three positive integers can form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, returning True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.

    #State: n remains a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers remains a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists containing distributed numbers from the numbers list, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are the sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c, respectively.

        #The program returns 'YES' and three lists group_a, group_b, and group_c, which contain distributed numbers from the sorted list 'numbers' in descending order. The sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c are sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c, respectively, and they satisfy the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c).
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and three target sums as input, and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups such that the sums of the numbers in each group satisfy a certain condition (func_1). If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups of numbers. If not, it returns 'NO'.
