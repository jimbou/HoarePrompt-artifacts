You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: n remains a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers remains a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists containing distributed numbers from the numbers list, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are the sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c, respectively.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES' and three lists group_a, group_b, and group_c, which contain distributed numbers from the sorted list 'numbers' in descending order. The sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c are sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c, respectively, and they satisfy the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c).
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES' and three lists group_a, group_b, and group_c, which contain distributed numbers from the sorted list 'numbers' in descending order. The sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c are sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c, respectively, and they satisfy the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c).

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
