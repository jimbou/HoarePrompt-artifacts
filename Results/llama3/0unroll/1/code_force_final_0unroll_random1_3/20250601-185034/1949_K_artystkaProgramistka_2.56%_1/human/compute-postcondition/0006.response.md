Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers and three target sums as input, and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups such that the sums of the numbers in each group satisfy a certain condition (func_1). If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups of numbers. If not, it returns 'NO'.**
