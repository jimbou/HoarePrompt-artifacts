#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: The array `dp` will have calculated values for `dp[3]` through `dp[n]` based on the recursive formula provided, with `dp[1]` remaining 1 and `dp[2]` remaining 3. Each value `dp[i]` for `i >= 3` will be the result of the formula applied iteratively, ensuring the result does not exceed 1000000007 due to the modulus operation.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and populates an array `dp` with values from `dp[1]` to `dp[n]` based on a recursive formula, ensuring results do not exceed 1000000007, with `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3.
