Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each number of remaining rows and columns, taking into account the fact that the computer will mirror each move. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of remaining rows and columns is 1 or 2.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations, which is efficient and accurate. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
