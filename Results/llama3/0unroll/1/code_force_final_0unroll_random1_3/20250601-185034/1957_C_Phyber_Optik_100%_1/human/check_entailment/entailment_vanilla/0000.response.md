Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for a given board size.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size 300007, which is sufficient to handle the maximum board size of 3 * 10^5. The array is initialized with -1, indicating that the values are not yet computed.

2. The `func_1` function is called with the argument 300000, which computes the `dp` values for board sizes from 1 to 300000. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are correct.

3. The recursive formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the `dp` values for larger board sizes. This formula is correct based on the problem description, as it considers the two cases where the current move is mirrored by the computer and where it is not.

4. In the main part of the program, the number of test cases `t` is read, and for each test case, the board size `n` and the number of moves `k` are read. The `invalid` set is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

5. The program then prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of possible final configurations for the given board size and number of moves. This is correct, as it considers the case where there are no valid moves remaining.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
