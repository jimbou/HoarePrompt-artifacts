Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given chessboard size `n` and number of moves `k`. The program first initializes an array `dp` to store the number of possible configurations for each chessboard size from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the values of `dp` using a recursive formula, ensuring that the results do not exceed 1000000007.

The program then reads the input for each test case, which includes the chessboard size `n` and the number of moves `k`. It creates a set `invalid` to store the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. The program then prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the cases where `n` is 1 or 2 separately. The recursive formula used to calculate `dp` is also correct, and the program ensures that the results do not exceed 1000000007.

Correctness: **True**
