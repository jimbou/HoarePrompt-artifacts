Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts a series of 24-hour times to 12-hour format and prints them. The program handles the hour conversion correctly by replacing 0 with 12, keeping hours less than or equal to 12 the same, and subtracting 12 from hours greater than 12 while adding a leading 0 if necessary. The program also correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

However, there is a small issue with the program. When the hour is greater than 12, the program subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading 0 if necessary. But it does not handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly. When the hour is 12, the program should print '12' instead of '00'. 

Correctness: **False**
