Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the hour is greater than 12 and the hour is not a single digit. For example, when the input is "14:34", the program will print "02:34 PM" instead of "02:34 PM". The correct output should be "02:34 PM", but the program is missing a leading zero for hours less than 10.

The issue is with the line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`. This line is trying to subtract 12 from the hour and then print the result. However, when the hour is greater than 12 and less than 20, the result of the subtraction will be a single digit, and the program is not adding a leading zero to the hour.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to add a leading zero to the hour when it is less than 10. Here is the corrected code:

```
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            hour = int(h) - 12
            if hour < 10:
                print('0{}'.format(hour), end='')
            else:
                print(hour, end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This corrected code will add a leading zero to the hour when it is less than 10, ensuring that the output is always in the correct format.
