Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly converts a series of 24-hour times to 12-hour format and prints them. It handles the hour and minute correctly, and appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The program also handles the edge case where the hour is 0, replacing it with 12.

Correctness: **True**
