Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts a 24-hour time format to a 12-hour time format. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.
3. It extracts the hour `h` from the string `s`.
4. If the hour is 0, it replaces it with 12.
5. If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it remains the same.
6. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from it and adds a leading 0 if necessary.
7. It prints the modified hour, followed by the minute (which remains the same), and appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12, and 'PM' otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Hours 0-11: remains the same
* Hour 12: remains the same
* Hours 13-23: subtracts 12 and adds a leading 0 if necessary

The program also correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
