Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of candies that can be put in a bag for each test case, based on the given values of a and b, and whether n is even or odd. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results, one per line.**
