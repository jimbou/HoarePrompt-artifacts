Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". It first checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C). If it is, then it is more advantageous to buy each yogurt at the regular price, so it prints A * B.

If B * 2 is not less than C, then it checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, then it is more advantageous to buy all yogurts at the promotion price, so it prints A * C / 2.

If A is not even, then it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (X = A // 2), and then prints the total cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price (X * C) plus the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
