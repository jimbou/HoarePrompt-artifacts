Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles, and it calculates the minimum cost based on whether buying two yogurts at the regular price or at the promotion price is more advantageous.

The program correctly handles the different cases:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the promotion price (C), it calculates the total cost as A * B, where A is the number of yogurts.

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the total cost as A * C / 2, since buying two yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the total cost as X * C + B, where X is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (A // 2), and B is the price of the remaining yogurt.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
