Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`.
3. The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2*a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`). If so, it calculates the total cost as `n*a`.
4. If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, it checks if the number of yogurts `n` is even. If `n` is even, it calculates the total cost as `n*b/2`.
5. If `n` is odd, it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (`n//2`), and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
6. The program prints the calculated total cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
