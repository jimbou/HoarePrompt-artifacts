Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program correctly handles the three possible scenarios:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the promotion price (C), it calculates the total cost as the number of yogurts (A) multiplied by the regular price (B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the total cost as the number of yogurts divided by 2, multiplied by the promotion price (C).

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the total cost as the integer division of the number of yogurts by 2, multiplied by the promotion price (C), plus the regular price (B) for the remaining yogurt.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost for buying n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
