Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program then checks three conditions:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is less than the price of two yogurts on promotion (b), it calculates the total cost as n * a.
2. If the number of yogurts (n) is even, it calculates the total cost as (n * b) / 2, since Maxim can buy all yogurts at the promotion price.
3. If the number of yogurts (n) is odd, it calculates the total cost as (n // 2) * b + a, since Maxim can buy (n // 2) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. The calculations are accurate, and the program produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
