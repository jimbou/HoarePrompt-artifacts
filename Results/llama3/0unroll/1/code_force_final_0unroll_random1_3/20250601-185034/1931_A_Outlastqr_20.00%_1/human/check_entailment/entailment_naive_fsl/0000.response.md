Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases for the encoded word. The program first checks if the encoded word is greater than 52, in which case it subtracts 53 from the encoded word and adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet to the word, followed by 'zz'. If the encoded word is between 26 and 52, it adds 'a' to the word, then the corresponding letter from the alphabet for the remaining value after subtracting 28, and finally 'z'. If the encoded word is less than or equal to 26, it adds 'aa' to the word and the corresponding letter from the alphabet for the remaining value after subtracting 3.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the encoded word is 3, in which case it outputs 'aaa', and when the encoded word is 78, in which case it outputs 'rzz'. The program also correctly handles the case when the encoded word is 24, in which case it outputs 'aav'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
