Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, generates a three-letter string for each integer based on its value, and prints these strings to standard output. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, instead producing output directly. The input integers are expected to be in the range 3 to 78, and the output strings consist of lowercase English letters. The function processes a variable number of inputs, determined by the first integer read from standard input, which specifies the number of subsequent integers to process.**
