Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. For each test case, it sorts the 2n integers, calculates the sum of the smallest n numbers, and prints this sum. The function repeats this process for all test cases, producing a total of t output lines, where t is the number of test cases specified at the beginning of the input.**
