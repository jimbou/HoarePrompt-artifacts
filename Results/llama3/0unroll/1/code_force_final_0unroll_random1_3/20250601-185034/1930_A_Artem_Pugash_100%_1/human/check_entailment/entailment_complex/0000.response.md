Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It iterates over the sorted list of integers in steps of 2, starting from the first integer (index 0). For each pair of integers, it adds the smaller integer (i.e., the one at the current index `i`) to the `score`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* By sorting the integers, we ensure that the smallest `n` integers are at the beginning of the list.
* By iterating over the list in steps of 2, we effectively pair up the smallest `n` integers with the next smallest `n` integers.
* By adding the smaller integer of each pair to the `score`, we maximize the final score, as we are always choosing the minimum of the two integers.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
