Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order, then iterates over the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair of integers to the score. This is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score, as it ensures that the smallest possible integer is added to the score in each move.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* When the number of integers is odd, the program still works correctly because it only considers pairs of integers.
* When the integers are all the same, the program still works correctly because it adds the same integer to the score in each move.
* When the integers are in any order, the program still works correctly because it sorts the list before iterating over it.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
