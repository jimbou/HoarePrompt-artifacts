Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the list of integers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of the two integers at each step to the score.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score. By sorting the list, the program guarantees that the smallest integers are paired together, resulting in the maximum possible score.

Furthermore, the program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves, and printing the maximum final score for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
