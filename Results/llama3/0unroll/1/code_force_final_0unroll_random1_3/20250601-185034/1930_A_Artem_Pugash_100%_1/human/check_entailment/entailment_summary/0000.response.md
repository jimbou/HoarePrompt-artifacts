Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element (index 0). For each pair of elements, it adds the smaller element to the `score`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* By sorting the integers, we ensure that the smallest `n` numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score.
* By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, we effectively pair each integer with its adjacent integer, which is the next smallest integer.
* By adding the smaller element of each pair to the score, we maximize the score.

The execution summary confirms that the program produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
