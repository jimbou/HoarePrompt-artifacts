Calculates and prints a list of integers based on input pairs of integers (n, k), where each integer in the output list represents the result of a calculation that depends on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater, the calculation involves a series of iterative updates to variables, ultimately leading to the calculation of a value y. If k is not greater, the calculation is simply 2 * k - 1. The function processes multiple input pairs and prints the corresponding results.
