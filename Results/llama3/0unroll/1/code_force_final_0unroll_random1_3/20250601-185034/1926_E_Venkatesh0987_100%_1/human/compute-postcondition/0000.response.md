Output State: **The output state is a list of t integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair (n, k). The calculation is based on the given formula, which depends on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater, the calculation involves a series of while loops that update variables s, d, i, g, h, and p, ultimately leading to the calculation of y. If k is not greater, the calculation is simply 2 * k - 1.**
