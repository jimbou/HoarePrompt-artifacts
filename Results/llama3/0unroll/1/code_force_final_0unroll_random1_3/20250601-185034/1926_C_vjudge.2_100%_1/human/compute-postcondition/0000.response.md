Output State: **N is 200001, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), pd is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).**

The first line assigns the value of `2 * 100000.0 + 1` to `N`, making `N` equal to 200001. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The third line creates a list `pd` of 200001 zeros. Since `t` lines of input are consumed by the code, stdin now contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
