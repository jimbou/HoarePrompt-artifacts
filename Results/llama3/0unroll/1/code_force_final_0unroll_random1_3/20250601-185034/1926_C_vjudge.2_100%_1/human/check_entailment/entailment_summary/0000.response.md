Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the cumulative sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `pd`. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum of digits for the given number `n`.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test. The precomputation approach allows it to avoid redundant calculations and directly access the required sums.

Correctness: **True**
