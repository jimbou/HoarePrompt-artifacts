This function reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to each input integer, and prints the results. It consumes all input integers and leaves the input stream empty. The function does not modify any input values or store them; it only uses them to compute and print the sum of digits. The function's output is a series of sums, one for each input integer, and it does not return any value.
