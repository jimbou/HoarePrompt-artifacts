Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first initializes a list `pd` of size `N` (where `N` is 200001) with all elements set to 0. This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` at index `i`.

2. The program then iterates over the range from 1 to `N-1` (inclusive) and for each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`. The cumulative sum is also added to the previous cumulative sum stored in `pd[i-1]`.

3. After the cumulative sum of digits is calculated and stored in the `pd` list, the program reads `t` test cases from the standard input, where each test case is an integer `n` between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive).

4. For each test case, the program simply prints the cumulative sum of digits stored in `pd[n]`, which is the sum of digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

The program's approach is correct because it uses dynamic programming to pre-calculate the cumulative sum of digits for all numbers up to 2*10^5, and then uses this pre-calculated information to answer each test case in constant time. This approach ensures that the program can handle a large number of test cases within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds.

Correctness: **True**
