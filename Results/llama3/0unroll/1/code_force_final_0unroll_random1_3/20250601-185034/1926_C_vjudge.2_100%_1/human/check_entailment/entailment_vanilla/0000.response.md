Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `pd`.
3. The program first initializes an array `pd` of size `N` (where `N` is 2 * 10^5 + 1) with all elements set to 0.
4. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `N` and for each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the sum.
5. The program also adds the sum of the digits of the previous number (`pd[i - 1]`) to the current sum, effectively calculating the cumulative sum of the digits.
6. After precomputing the sums, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum `pd[n]`.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly precomputes the sums of digits for each number up to 2 * 10^5 and uses this precomputed array to efficiently calculate the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case. The time complexity is O(N) for the precomputation and O(t) for the test cases, which should be within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
