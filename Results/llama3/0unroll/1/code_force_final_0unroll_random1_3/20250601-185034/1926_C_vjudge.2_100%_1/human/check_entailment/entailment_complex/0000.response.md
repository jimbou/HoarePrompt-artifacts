Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly initializes an array `pd` of size `N` (where `N` is 200001) to store the cumulative sum of digits from 1 to `N`. This is done using a single loop that iterates from 1 to `N`, and for each number `i`, it adds the sum of its digits to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`.

2. The program then reads `t` test cases from the input, where each test case is an integer `n` between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).

3. For each test case, the program simply prints the value stored in `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of digits from 1 to `n`.

4. The program correctly handles the input and output, and it does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the size of the array `pd` and t is the number of test cases. Since N is a constant (200001) and t is at most 10^4, the program runs within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The program does not have any memory issues, as it only uses a single array of size N to store the cumulative sum of digits.

7. The program does not modify any input values or store them; it only uses them to compute and print the sum of digits.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
