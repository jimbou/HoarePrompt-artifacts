Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means that the string is already sorted and the minimum number of pieces needed is cut1 + 1. Otherwise, the minimum number of pieces needed is cut0 + cut1.

This logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces, the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string, and all the pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the string is already sorted, where the string has only one '1' or '0', and where the string has multiple '1's and '0's.

Therefore, the program is correct and the Correctness is **True**.
