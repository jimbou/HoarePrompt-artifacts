The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`. Since `input()` accepts an integer from stdin and `int` converts it to an integer, `t` is assigned the integer value from stdin. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) first, so `t` is assigned this integer value. The remaining strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1' are still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains t strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
