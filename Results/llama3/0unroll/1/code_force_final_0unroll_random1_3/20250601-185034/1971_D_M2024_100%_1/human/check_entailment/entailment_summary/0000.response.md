Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The program works by iterating through the input string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). 

If cut0 is 0, it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted by making cuts only at the '1's. In this case, the program prints cut1 + 1, which is the minimum number of pieces needed. 

If cut0 is not 0, it means the string is not sorted and needs to be cut at both '0's and '1's. In this case, the program prints cut0 + cut1, which is the minimum number of pieces needed.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
