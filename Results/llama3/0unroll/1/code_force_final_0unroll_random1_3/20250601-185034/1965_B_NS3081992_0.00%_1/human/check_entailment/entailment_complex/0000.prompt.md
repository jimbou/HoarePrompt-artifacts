Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    #The program returns a list of two integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by a space.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of 'rows_number' elements, where each element is the result of calling the 'func_3()' function. The function does not modify the input variable 'rows_number' and returns the generated list. The exact values in the list are determined by the 'func_3()' function, which is not defined in the provided code.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin is a file object that contains a sequence of bytes, and readline() is a method that reads a line from the file and returns it as a bytes object, and rstrip() is a method that removes trailing bytes from the bytes object.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(), and returns this list. The function accepts a non-negative integer 'rows' as input and does not modify it. The final state of the program is that it returns a list of 'rows' number of elements, without altering the input 'rows' value.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return input()
    #The program returns the string that is currently in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads and returns a string from the standard input (stdin), effectively capturing and passing on the user's input without any modifications or transformations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string. The list contains values of any type and value.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer and a key in d, and rank is a list of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively processing the list of integers associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the 'processing' list, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the 'rank' list with the calculated rank and returns it.

    #State: *a and b are non-negative integers, b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y is the return value of func_13(b, a % b), x is the return value of func_13(b, a % b), and g is the return value of func_13(b, a % b). The value of x - a // b * y is calculated using the return values of func_13(b, a % b) and the initial values of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is zero, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and uses the results to compute the final coefficients x and y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of a given integer n and an integer k.
