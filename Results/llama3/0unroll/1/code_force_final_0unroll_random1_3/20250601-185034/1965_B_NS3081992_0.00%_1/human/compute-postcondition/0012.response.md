Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is 1, the current value of k is 1. Otherwise, the list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), followed by k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, b, l, k, and bk remain unchanged.***
