This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is zero, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and uses the results to compute the final coefficients x and y.
