This function calculates and returns the rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively processing the list of integers associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the 'processing' list, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the 'rank' list with the calculated rank and returns it.
