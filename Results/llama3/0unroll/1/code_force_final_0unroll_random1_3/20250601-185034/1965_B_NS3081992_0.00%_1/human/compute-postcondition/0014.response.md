Functionality: **This function generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of a given integer n and an integer k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a multi-line string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a string of space-separated integers, which includes the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, followed by k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive).**
