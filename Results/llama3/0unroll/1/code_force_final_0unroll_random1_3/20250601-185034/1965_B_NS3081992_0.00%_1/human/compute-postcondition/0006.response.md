Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is larger than 1, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, ans is an empty list, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk.**

The code first converts the integer k to a binary string and assigns it to bk, removing the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary literals. Then, it initializes an empty list ans and assigns the length of bk to lk. The values of n, k, b, and l remain unchanged.
