Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads an integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers, where the first integer is non-negative and the second integer is non-negative and less than or equal to the first integer.
Function number 3 :

 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list of 'rows_number' elements, where each element is the result of calling the 'func_3()' function. The function does not modify the input variable 'rows_number' and returns the generated list. The exact values in the list are determined by the 'func_3()' function, which is not defined in the provided code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line from the standard input file object, removes trailing bytes, and returns the resulting bytes object.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a string from standard input, removes trailing newlines and whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]

 Output hints for function7:  Reads a space-separated list of two integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:

def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  Generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(), and returns this list. The function accepts a non-negative integer 'rows' as input and does not modify it. The final state of the program is that it returns a list of 'rows' number of elements, without altering the input 'rows' value.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads and returns a string from the standard input (stdin), effectively capturing and passing on the user's input without any modifications or transformations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string. The list contains values of any type and value.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd', where the rank is determined by recursively processing the list of integers associated with 'da' and updating the 'rank' list accordingly. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the 'processing' list, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the 'rank' list with the calculated rank and returns it.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1

''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is zero, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and uses the results to compute the final coefficients x and y.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():

    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)

        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of a given integer n and an integer k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a multi-line string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a string of space-separated integers, which includes the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, followed by k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive).
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  This function writes a series of non-negative integers to the standard output, with the number of lines equal to the value returned by func_10(). Each integer is the result of a call to func_14().
