Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines of output, each containing an integer. For each input integer n, if n is 1, the output will be 1. If n is a power of 2 (i.e., n = 2^k for some integer k), the output will be n. Otherwise, the output will be the largest power of 2 less than n. The number of output lines will be equal to the initial value of n_cases.**
