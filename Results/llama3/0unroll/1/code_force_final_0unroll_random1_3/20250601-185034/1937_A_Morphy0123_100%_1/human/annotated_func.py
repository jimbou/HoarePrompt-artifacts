#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), representing the length of the array a.
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The output state will contain multiple lines of output, each containing an integer. For each input integer n, if n is 1, the output will be 1. If n is a power of 2 (i.e., n = 2^k for some integer k), the output will be n. Otherwise, the output will be the largest power of 2 less than n. The number of output lines will be equal to the initial value of n_cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases and each subsequent line contains an integer. It then processes each integer by either printing 1 if the integer is 1, printing the integer itself if it's a power of 2, or printing the largest power of 2 less than the integer otherwise. The function outputs multiple lines, each containing the processed integer, with the number of output lines equal to the initial number of test cases.
