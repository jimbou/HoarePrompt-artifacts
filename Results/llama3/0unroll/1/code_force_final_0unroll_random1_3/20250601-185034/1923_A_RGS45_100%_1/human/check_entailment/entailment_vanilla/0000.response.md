Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program works as follows:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the arrangement of chips and free cells as a string `arr`.
3. It finds the index of the first chip `x` from the left and the index of the first chip `y` from the right (by reversing the string and finding the first chip).
4. It extracts the substring `z` from the original string `arr` starting from the index `x` to the end of the string minus the index `y`. This substring represents the block of chips that needs to be moved.
5. It counts the number of free cells (represented by '0') in the substring `z` and prints this count as the minimum number of operations required to move the chips.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the block of chips that needs to be moved and counts the number of free cells within that block. The minimum number of operations required to move the chips is indeed equal to the number of free cells within the block, as each free cell needs to be filled by moving a chip to its left.

Correctness: **True**
