Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the left using `arr.find('1')`.
2. It then finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. The `[::-1]` is used to reverse the string.
3. It then extracts the substring from the first '1' to the last '1' using `arr[x:n - y]`.
4. Finally, it counts the number of '0's (free cells) in this substring using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

This approach is correct because it effectively finds the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. By finding the first and last '1's, it identifies the range of cells that need to be moved. By counting the number of '0's in this range, it determines the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
