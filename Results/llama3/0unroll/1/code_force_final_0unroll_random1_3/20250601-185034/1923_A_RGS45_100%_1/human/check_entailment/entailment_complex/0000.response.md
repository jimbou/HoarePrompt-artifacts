Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the array using `arr.find('1')` and stores the index in `x`. This gives the starting position of the first block of ones.
4. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the array by reversing the array and using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This gives the ending position of the last block of ones.
5. It extracts the subarray from `x` to `n - y` (which is the ending position of the last block of ones) and stores it in `z`. This subarray contains the longest contiguous block of ones.
6. It counts the number of zeros in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where n is the number of cells.

Correctness: **True**
