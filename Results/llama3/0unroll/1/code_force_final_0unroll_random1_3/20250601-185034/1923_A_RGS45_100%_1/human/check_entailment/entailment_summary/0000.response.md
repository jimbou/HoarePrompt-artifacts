Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.
3. It finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the array `x` and the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the array `y` (by reversing the array and finding the first occurrence of '1').
4. It then extracts the subarray `z` from `x` to `n - y`, which represents the longest contiguous subarray of ones.
5. Finally, it counts the number of zeros in the subarray `z` and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the longest contiguous subarray of ones and counts the number of zeros within it, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Correctness: **True**
