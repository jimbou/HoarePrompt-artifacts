Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1). In each test case, at least one a_i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers, where at least one of these integers is 1. The values of `n` and the integers in each test case are still unknown, but their ranges are specified.
