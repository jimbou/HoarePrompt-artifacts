Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to not wait too long in a queue. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two sets of n space-separated positive integers.

The program calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing and summing the integers from the two sets, following specific rules. It iterates through the sets in reverse order, starting from the end of the queue, and decides whether to pay the cost of the current person (a_i) or the cost of the person at the previous position (b_i) plus the cost of the current person (a_i). This decision is based on which option is cheaper.

The program then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
