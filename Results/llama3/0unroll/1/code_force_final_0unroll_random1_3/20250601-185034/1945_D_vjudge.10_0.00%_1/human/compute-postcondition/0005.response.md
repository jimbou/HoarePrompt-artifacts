Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two sets of n space-separated positive integers. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing and summing the integers from the two sets, following specific rules. The function then prints the minimum cost for each test case.**
