Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the number of cows and the second integer is the index of the cow that the user owns, the list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow that the user owns, ind is a list of indices of the cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow, and c is the number of cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow, which is at most 2. The list of indices of the cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow is not empty. If k is equal to 14, the list of indices of the cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
