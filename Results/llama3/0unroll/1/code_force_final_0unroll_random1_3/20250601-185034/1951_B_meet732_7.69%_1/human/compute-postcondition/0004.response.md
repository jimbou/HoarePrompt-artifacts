Based on the initial state, the list `ind` contains the indices of the cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow. Since `c` is the number of cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow, which is at most 2, the list `ind` will contain at most 2 indices.

Output: **[list of indices of cows with higher Cowdeforces ratings than the user's cow, with at most 2 elements]**
