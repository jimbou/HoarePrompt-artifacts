Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b, `ops` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `path_ba` remains unchanged as it was already containing the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b. The code only introduces a new variable `ops` and assigns it an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged value of `path_ba` and the newly introduced empty list `ops`.
