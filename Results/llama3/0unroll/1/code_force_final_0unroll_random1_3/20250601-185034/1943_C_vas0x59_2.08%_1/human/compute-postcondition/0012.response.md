Output State: `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of integers. The first integer in each tuple is either `c1` or `c2`, and the second integer is an index `i` from the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. The length of `ops` is twice the number of iterations of the loop, which is `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) // 2`. The values of `path_ba`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
