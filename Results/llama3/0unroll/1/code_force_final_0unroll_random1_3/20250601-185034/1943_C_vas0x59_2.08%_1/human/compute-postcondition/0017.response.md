Output: **A sequence of lines, each containing a pair of numbers. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, each pair consists of the index of the middle vertex c plus 1, and an integer i, ranging from 1 to ci + 1 (inclusive), where ci is half the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, each pair consists of the index c1 plus 1, and an odd index i into `path_ba`, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 up to `len(path_ba) - c1`. The number of lines is equal to the length of `ops`.**
