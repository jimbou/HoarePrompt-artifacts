Based on the precondition, the length of `ops` depends on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the middle vertex `c` and an integer `i`, ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). Here, `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, and `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`. In this case, the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of indices into `path_ba`. The first element of each tuple is `c1`, and the second element is an odd index `i` into `path_ba`, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 up to `len(path_ba) - c1`. The length of `ops` is twice the number of iterations of the loop, which is `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) // 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of `ops`, which depends on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.

Output: **length of ops (where length of ops is either ci + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or twice the number of iterations of the loop if the length of path_ba is even)**
