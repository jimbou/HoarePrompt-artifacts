Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: u2vs is a list of n lists where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices adjacent to the vertex represented by the index of the inner list, a is the index of the vertex with the maximum distance from the starting vertex 0, b is the index of the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, d is a dictionary containing the distance of each vertex from vertex a, previous is a dictionary containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex a to each vertex, path_ba is a list containing the index of vertex b.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
