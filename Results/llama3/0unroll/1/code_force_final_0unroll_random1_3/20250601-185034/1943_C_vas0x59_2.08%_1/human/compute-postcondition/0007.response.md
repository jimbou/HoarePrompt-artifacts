Output State: **path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b, ops is an empty list, ci is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba, c is the middle vertex of path_ba.**

The code first calculates the index of the middle vertex of the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b and assigns it to `ci`. Since the length of `path_ba` is an odd number, `ci` will be an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`. Then, it assigns the middle vertex of `path_ba` to `c`. The value of `ops` remains unchanged as an empty list.
