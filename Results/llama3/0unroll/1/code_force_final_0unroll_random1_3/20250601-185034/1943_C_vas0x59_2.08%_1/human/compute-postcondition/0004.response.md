Output State: **path_ba contains the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b.**

In this output state, the list path_ba contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b. The loop iteratively appends the previous vertex in the shortest path to path_ba until it reaches the starting vertex a, which is represented by -1 in the previous dictionary.
