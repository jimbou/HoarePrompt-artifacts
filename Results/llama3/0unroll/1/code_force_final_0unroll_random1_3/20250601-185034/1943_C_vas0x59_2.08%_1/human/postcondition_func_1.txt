This function reads the number of vertices and edges of a graph from standard input, constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph, finds the shortest path between two vertices using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and then generates a list of operations based on the length of the shortest path. If the length of the shortest path is odd, the operations involve a middle vertex and indices ranging from 0 to half the length of the path. If the length of the shortest path is even, the operations involve two vertices and odd indices into the path. The function then prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, with each operation represented as a pair of numbers. Finally, the function returns None.
