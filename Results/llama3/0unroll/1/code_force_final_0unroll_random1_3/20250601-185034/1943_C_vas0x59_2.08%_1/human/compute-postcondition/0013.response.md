Output State: `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of indices into `path_ba`. The first element of each tuple is `c1`, and the second element is an odd index `i` into `path_ba`, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 up to `len(path_ba) - c1`. The length of `ops` is twice the number of iterations of the loop, which is `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) // 2`. The values of `path_ba`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
