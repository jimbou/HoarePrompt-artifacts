Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b, `ops` is an empty list, `c1` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `c2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`.**

The code snippet calculates two new variables, `c1` and `c2`, based on the length of `path_ba`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is assigned half of this length, and `c1` is assigned half of the length minus 1. The values of `path_ba` and `ops` remain unchanged.
