Output: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b, `ops` is a list. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the middle vertex c and an integer i, ranging from 0 to ci (inclusive), ci is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba, c is the middle vertex of path_ba. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of indices into `path_ba`. The first element of each tuple is `c1`, and the second element is an odd index `i` into `path_ba`, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 up to `len(path_ba) - c1`. The values of `path_ba`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged, and the following is printed: a list of strings where each string contains a pair of values, the first value is `c1 + 1` and the second value is `i`, for each tuple in `ops`, where `c1` and `i` are the elements of the tuple, and each string is printed on a new line**
