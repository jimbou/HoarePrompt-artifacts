Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the number of cows and the index of a specific cow, and the second line contains the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. For each test case, it determines the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by the cow at the specified index by swapping it with the first cow and then with the cow at the position where the first cow's rating is exceeded, and prints this maximum value. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results in the same order as the input.**
