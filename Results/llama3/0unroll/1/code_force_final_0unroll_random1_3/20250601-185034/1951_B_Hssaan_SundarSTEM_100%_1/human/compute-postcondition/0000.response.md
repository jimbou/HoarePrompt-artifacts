Output State: **The output state contains the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by the cow at index k, for each test case. The number of cows that can be defeated is determined by swapping the cow at index k with the first cow and then with the cow at the position where the first cow's rating is exceeded, and taking the maximum of these two values. The output is in the same order as the input test cases.**
