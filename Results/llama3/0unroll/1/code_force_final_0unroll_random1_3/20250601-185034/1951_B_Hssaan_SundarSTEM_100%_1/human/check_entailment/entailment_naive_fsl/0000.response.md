Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The program only considers swapping the cow with the first position or the position after the current position, but it does not consider other possible swaps that could lead to more wins.

For example, consider the input:

6 3
12 10 14 11 8 3

The program will swap the cow with the first position, resulting in:

14 10 12 11 8 3

The cow will win 1 match, but if we swap the cow with the third position, we get:

12 10 11 14 8 3

The cow will win 2 matches. The program does not consider this swap and therefore does not find the maximum number of wins.

The program needs to be modified to consider all possible swaps and find the maximum number of wins.
