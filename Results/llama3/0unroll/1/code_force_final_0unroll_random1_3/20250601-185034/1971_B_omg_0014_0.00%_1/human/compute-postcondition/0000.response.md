Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The other information from the initial state is still valid, but the first input (the integer) has been consumed and is no longer in the stdin.
