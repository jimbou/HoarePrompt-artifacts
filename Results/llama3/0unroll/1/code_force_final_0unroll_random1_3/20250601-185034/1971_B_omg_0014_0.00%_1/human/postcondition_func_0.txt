This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings. It then checks each string to see if it contains exactly two unique characters. If a string contains exactly two unique characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the string sorted in ascending order if it was not already sorted that way, or in descending order if it was already sorted in ascending order. The function does not modify the input strings or the value of t.
