stdin contains multiple sets of input data. Each set of input data starts with a line containing two integers n and k (1 <= k < n <= 10^5), followed by n - 1 lines, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n). The first line of the stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of sets of input data.
