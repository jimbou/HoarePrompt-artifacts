#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple sets of input data. Each set of input data starts with a line containing two integers n and k (1 <= k < n <= 10^5), followed by n - 1 lines, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n). The first line of the stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of sets of input data.
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads multiple sets of input data from stdin, where each set contains two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines of two integers v and u, and processes each set by calling the solve function, ultimately emptying stdin.
