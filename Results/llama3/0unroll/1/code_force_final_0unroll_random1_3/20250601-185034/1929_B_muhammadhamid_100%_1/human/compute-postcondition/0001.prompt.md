You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The output state will be the result of t executions of the loop, where each execution will print the minimum number of colored cells required to satisfy the condition for the given n and k values. The output will be a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the minimum number of colored cells required.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
