Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains two integers (n and k) representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell, respectively. It then processes each test case, printing the minimum number of colored cells required to satisfy the condition for the given n and k values. The output is a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the minimum number of colored cells required.**
