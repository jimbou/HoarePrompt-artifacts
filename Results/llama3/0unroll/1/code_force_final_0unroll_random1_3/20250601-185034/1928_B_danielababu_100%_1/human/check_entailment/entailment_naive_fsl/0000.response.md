Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the program does not implement any logic to solve this problem. It only contains some utility functions for input and sorting, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should return 2 because we can add a permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the array to get [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] and the maximum number of elements equal to the same number is 2 (the number 2 and 4 both appear twice). However, the program does not return 2 for this input.

The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem, and therefore, it is incorrect.
