#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is greater than 0 and was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, which are the result of converting each string in the input into an integer, where the input is a space-separated list of integers from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts each string into an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were in the space-separated list in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a list of integers. It does not modify the input or perform any additional actions beyond parsing the input into a list of integers. The function's purpose is to convert the input string into a usable list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of integers in ascending order, where the integers are obtained from the space-separated list of integers in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input, converts them into a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a list of strings, where each string is a word from the space-separated list of strings in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input and returns a map object containing the individual words as strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings that were in the input, sorted in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr remains a list of positive integers, ans contains the cumulative product of the elements in arr, and tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns the cumulative product of the elements in the list 'arr' of positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the cumulative product of a list of positive integers. It takes a list of positive integers as input, leaves the original list unchanged, and produces a new list where each element is the product of all elements up to that point in the original list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr remains a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in arr from last to first, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in arr from last to first.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of non-negative integers from last to first and returns the result as a list, without modifying the original list.
