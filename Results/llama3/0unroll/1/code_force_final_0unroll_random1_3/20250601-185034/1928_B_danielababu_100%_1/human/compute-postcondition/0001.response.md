To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `tem` is 1.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to the first index (`0`).
   - In each iteration, `tem` is multiplied by the current element of `arr` at index `i`.
   - The updated value of `tem` is then appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr` because it is multiplied by each element in `arr` in each iteration.
   - `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` from the last element to the first. The first element in `ans` will be the product of the last element in `arr`, the second element in `ans` will be the product of the last two elements in `arr`, and so on, until the last element in `ans`, which will be the product of all elements in `arr`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

Output State: **arr remains a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in arr from last to first, tem is the product of all elements in arr.**
