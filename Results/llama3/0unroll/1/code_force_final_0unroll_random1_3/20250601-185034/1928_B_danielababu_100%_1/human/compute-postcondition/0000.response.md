Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is an empty list, tem is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `ans` and `tem`, without modifying the existing variable `arr`. The variable `ans` is assigned an empty list, and `tem` is assigned the value 1. The list `arr` remains unchanged, retaining its original list of non-negative integers.
