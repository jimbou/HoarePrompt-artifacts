Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly determines the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program works by first checking if the number of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, in which case Bob can win once. Then, it calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by dividing each number by 2 and summing the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input numbers are 0. The use of the math.floor function ensures that the division by 2 is rounded down to the nearest integer, which is correct according to the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
