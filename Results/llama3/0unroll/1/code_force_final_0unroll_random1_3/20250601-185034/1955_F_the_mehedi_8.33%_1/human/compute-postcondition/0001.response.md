Functionality: **The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. It then calculates and prints the count of pairs of integers that can be formed from these four integers, considering all possible pairs and counting each pair only once. The function repeats this process for a specified number of lines, as indicated by an initial integer input.**
