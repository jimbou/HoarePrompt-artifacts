Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the provided problem description. The program iterates over each sign's periodicity, adding the time it takes for the sign to occur to the total year. The time it takes for each sign to occur is calculated as the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity, or the sign's periodicity if the remainder is zero. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem description.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity is a clever optimization, as it avoids the need to explicitly calculate the next occurrence of each sign.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
