Output State: **The output state will contain `t` lines, each representing the calculated `year` for each test case. The `year` is calculated by iterating over the `n` integers in each test case, adding the least common multiple of the current `year` and the current integer `ai` to `year`. The final `year` for each test case is printed on a new line.**
