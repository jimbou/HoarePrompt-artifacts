Functionality: **Calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of a series of integers for multiple test cases. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the calculated LCM for each test case to the standard output. The input is expected to be provided through the standard input, with the number of test cases and the integers for each test case specified in a specific format.**
