Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. The next year is calculated by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity to the current year, or by adding the sign's periodicity to the current year if the remainder is zero. This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the signs have different periodicities, and cases where the signs occur in the same year. The program also handles the edge case where the first sign occurs in the first year.

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all the examples provided. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
