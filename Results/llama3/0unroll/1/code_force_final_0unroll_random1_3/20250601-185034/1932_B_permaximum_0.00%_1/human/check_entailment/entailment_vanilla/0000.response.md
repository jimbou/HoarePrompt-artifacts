Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the provided periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` from the input.
4. It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which will keep track of the current year.
5. The program then iterates over each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
6. For each `ai`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` (i.e., `year % ai`) to `year`. If `year` is exactly divisible by `ai`, it simply adds `ai` to `year`. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
7. After iterating over all periodicities, the program prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of the expression `year % ai or ai` is a clever way to handle the case where `year` is exactly divisible by `ai`, avoiding the need for an explicit `if` statement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
