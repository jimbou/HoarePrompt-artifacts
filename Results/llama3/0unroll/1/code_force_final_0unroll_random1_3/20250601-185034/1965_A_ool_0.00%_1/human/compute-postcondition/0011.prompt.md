You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is `False`, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: arr is a list of positive integers, A is True, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers, not_c is True
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers. If not_c is True, then A is False and not_c remains True. Otherwise, the state of A and not_c remains unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If not_c is True, then it returns 'Bob'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, and 'Bob' if A is False.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If not_c is True, then it returns 'Bob'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, and 'Bob' if A is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
