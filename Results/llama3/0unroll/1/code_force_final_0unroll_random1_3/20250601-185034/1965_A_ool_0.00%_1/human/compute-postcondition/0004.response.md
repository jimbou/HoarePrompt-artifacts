Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers, not_c is True**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing positive integers with the first element being 1. The variable `A` is still `False`. A new list `set_` is created, containing unique positive integers from `arr` in sorted order. Additionally, a new variable `not_c` is introduced and set to `True`.
