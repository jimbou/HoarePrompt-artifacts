The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to its opposite. Since `A` was initially `True`, it will now be `False`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers, `not_c` is True**
