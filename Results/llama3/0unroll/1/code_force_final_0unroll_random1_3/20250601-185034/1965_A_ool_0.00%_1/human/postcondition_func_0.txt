Determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the input list of positive integers. If the list does not start with 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the sorted list of unique integers is consecutive (i.e., has no gaps). If it is consecutive, the function returns 'Bob'. If it is not consecutive, the function returns 'Alice' if a flag 'A' is True and 'Bob' if 'A' is False. The flag 'A' is toggled for each gap found in the sorted list of unique integers.
