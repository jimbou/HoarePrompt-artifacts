Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains duplicate elements. The function `func_1` uses a set to remove duplicates, but it does not consider the original order of the elements. This can lead to incorrect results when the smallest nonempty pile is not the first element in the sorted set.

For example, if the input array is `[2, 2, 3, 4]`, the program will return `'Bob'`, but the correct answer is `'Alice'`. This is because the smallest nonempty pile is 2, and Alice can remove 2 stones from each pile on her first turn, leaving Bob with no move.

The program should be modified to consider the original order of the elements and handle duplicate elements correctly.
