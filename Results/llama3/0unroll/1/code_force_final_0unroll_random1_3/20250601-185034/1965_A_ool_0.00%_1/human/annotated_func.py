    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers. If not_c is True, then A is False and not_c remains True. Otherwise, the state of A and not_c remains unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If not_c is True, then it returns 'Bob'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, and 'Bob' if A is False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the input list of positive integers. If the list does not start with 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the sorted list of unique integers is consecutive (i.e., has no gaps). If it is consecutive, the function returns 'Bob'. If it is not consecutive, the function returns 'Alice' if a flag 'A' is True and 'Bob' if 'A' is False. The flag 'A' is toggled for each gap found in the sorted list of unique integers.
