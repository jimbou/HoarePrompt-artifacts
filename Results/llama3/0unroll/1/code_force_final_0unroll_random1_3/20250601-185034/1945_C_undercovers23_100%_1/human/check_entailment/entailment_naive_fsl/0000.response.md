Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of houses is odd. In this case, the program calculates `pk` as `n / 2`, which is a float, but then uses it as if it were an integer. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is `n = 5` and `s = "10101"`, the program calculates `pk` as `2.5`, but then uses it as if it were `2`. This leads to incorrect results when calculating the percentages of zeros and ones.

To fix this, the program should calculate `pk` as `n // 2` when `n` is odd, to ensure that it is an integer.
