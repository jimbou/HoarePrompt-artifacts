Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%. If no such index is found, the output is either 0 or the length of the string, depending on whether the percentage of ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50% or not. The list is sorted in ascending order.**
