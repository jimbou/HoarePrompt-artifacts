The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5), which is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a string a of length `t`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
