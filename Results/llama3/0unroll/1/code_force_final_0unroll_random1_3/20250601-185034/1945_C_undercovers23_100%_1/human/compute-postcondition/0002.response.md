Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%. If no such index is found, it returns either 0 or the length of the string, depending on whether the percentage of ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50% or not. The function returns a list of these minimum indices, one for each test case, sorted in ascending order.**
