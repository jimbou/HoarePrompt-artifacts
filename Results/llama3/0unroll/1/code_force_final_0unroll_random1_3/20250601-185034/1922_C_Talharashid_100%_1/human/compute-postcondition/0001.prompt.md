You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and finally an integer m followed by m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers t, n, m, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x_i, and y_i are all non-negative and satisfy the following constraints: 1 <= t <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^5, 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, and x_i != y_i.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        
        d1[2] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        
        m = int(input())
        
        for j in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a number of test cases equal to the value of t. For each test case, it will process a list of n unique integers and m pairs of integers. The output will be the difference in the values of two dictionaries, d1 and d2, which are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list and the pairs of integers. The output will be the sum of the differences between the values of d1 and d2 for each pair of integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
