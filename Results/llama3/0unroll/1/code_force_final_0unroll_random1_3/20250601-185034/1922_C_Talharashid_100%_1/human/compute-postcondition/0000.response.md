Output State: **The loop will execute for a number of test cases equal to the value of t. For each test case, it will process a list of n unique integers and m pairs of integers. The output will be the difference in the values of two dictionaries, d1 and d2, which are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list and the pairs of integers. The output will be the sum of the differences between the values of d1 and d2 for each pair of integers.**
