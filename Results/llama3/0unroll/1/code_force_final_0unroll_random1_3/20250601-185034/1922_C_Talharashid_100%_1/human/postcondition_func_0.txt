This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a list of unique integers and pairs of integers. For each test case, it calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the list and the pairs of integers, storing these differences in two dictionaries, d1 and d2. The function then outputs the sum of the differences between the values of d1 and d2 for each pair of integers, considering the order of the pairs. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified in the input.
