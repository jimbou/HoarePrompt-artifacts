Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. The program uses two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the cumulative distances from the first city to each subsequent city and from the last city to each preceding city, respectively. The program then uses these dictionaries to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities.

The program handles the cases where the closest city is to the left or to the right of the current city correctly. It also handles the cases where the query is from a city to a city that is to its left or to its right correctly.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates over the list of cities once to calculate the cumulative distances, and then iterates over the list of queries once to calculate the minimum number of coins needed for each query.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of cities. This is because the program uses two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the cumulative distances, and each dictionary has n entries.

Correctness: **True**
