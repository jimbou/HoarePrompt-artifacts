Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and finally an integer m followed by m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers t, n, m, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x_i, and y_i are all non-negative and satisfy the following constraints: 1 <= t <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^5, 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, and x_i != y_i.**
