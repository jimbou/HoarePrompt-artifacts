Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between consecutive cities in both forward and backward directions.

The function `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city by comparing the distances between the current city and its adjacent cities. If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it sets the distance to 1; otherwise, it sets the distance to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The program then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between consecutive cities in both forward and backward directions using the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists. These lists are used to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between any two cities.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls the `func_1` function to calculate the closest cities, and then calculates the prefix sums. It then reads the queries and uses the prefix sums to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between the cities specified in each query.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by using prefix sums to avoid redundant calculations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
