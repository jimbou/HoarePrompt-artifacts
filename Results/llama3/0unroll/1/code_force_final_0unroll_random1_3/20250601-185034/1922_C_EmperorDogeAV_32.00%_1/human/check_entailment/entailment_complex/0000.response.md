Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The function `func_1` correctly determines the closest city for each city, and the prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are correctly calculated to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities in either direction.

The program handles the cases where the closest city is either the previous or next city, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The use of prefix sums allows the program to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities in O(1) time.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
