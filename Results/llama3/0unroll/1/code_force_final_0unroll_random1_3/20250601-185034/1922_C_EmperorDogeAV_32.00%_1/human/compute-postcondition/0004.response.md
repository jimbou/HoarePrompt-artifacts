Functionality: This function takes a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of n-1 integers. For each element in the input list (except the first and last), it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and its next consecutive element, and compares it with the absolute difference between the current element and its previous consecutive element. If the difference with the next element is smaller, it sets the corresponding output element to 1; otherwise, it sets the output element to the absolute difference with the next element. The function effectively determines the closest neighbor (either previous or next) for each element in the input list (except the first and last) and returns a list representing these closest neighbor relationships.
