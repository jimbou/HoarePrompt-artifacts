#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer.
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]

            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list cities.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of n-1 integers. For each element in the input list, it compares the absolute difference between the current element and its previous element with the absolute difference between the current element and its next element. If the difference with the next element is smaller, it sets the corresponding output element to 1; otherwise, it sets the output element to the absolute difference with the next element. The function effectively determines the closest neighbor for each element in the input list, either the previous or next element, and returns a list of these closest neighbor distances or 1 if the next element is closer.
