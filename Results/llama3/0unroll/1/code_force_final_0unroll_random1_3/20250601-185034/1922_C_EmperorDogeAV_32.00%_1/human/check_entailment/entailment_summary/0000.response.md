Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. The program first calculates the closest city for each city in the forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of the closest city distances in both directions. Finally, it uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

The `func_1` function correctly determines the closest city for each city by comparing the absolute difference between the current city and its previous city with the absolute difference between the current city and its next city. If the next city is closer, it sets the corresponding output element to 1; otherwise, it sets the output element to the absolute difference with the next city.

The program also correctly handles the case where the query is from a city to a city that is not in the forward direction. In this case, it uses the prefix sum of the backward closest city distances to calculate the minimum number of coins needed.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
