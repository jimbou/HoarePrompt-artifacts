Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of n-1 integers. For each element in the input list, it compares the absolute difference between the current element and its previous element with the absolute difference between the current element and its next element. If the difference with the next element is smaller, it sets the corresponding output element to 1; otherwise, it sets the output element to the absolute difference with the next element. The function effectively determines the closest neighbor for each element in the input list, either the previous or next element, and returns a list of these closest neighbor distances or 1 if the next element is closer.
