Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

The program first calculates the closest city for each city in both the forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in both directions.

When a query is made to travel from city `a` to city `b`, the program checks if `a` is less than `b`. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by subtracting the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in the forward direction at index `a-1` from the prefix sum at index `b-1`. If `a` is not less than `b`, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by subtracting the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in the backward direction at index `b-1` from the prefix sum at index `a-1`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when `a` is equal to `b`, when `a` is less than `b`, and when `a` is greater than `b`. It also handles the case when the closest city is the next city in the forward or backward direction, in which case the distance is 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
