Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of strings, where each string is either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input test cases. The length of the output list is equal to the initial value of `t`. The output list contains the results of the game for each test case, where 'Alice' means Alice wins and 'Bob' means Bob wins. The initial value of `t` is not changed, and the input test cases are consumed by the loop, leaving the stdin empty.**
