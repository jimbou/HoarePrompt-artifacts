stdin contains a sequence of lines, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
