Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. n, m, and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a_i and b_i are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.**
