Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three lines of integers. It then processes these test cases to find the number of valid subarrays of a certain size that contain at least a specified number of elements from a given set. The function prints the count of such valid subarrays for each test case and resets its internal state after processing each test case.**
