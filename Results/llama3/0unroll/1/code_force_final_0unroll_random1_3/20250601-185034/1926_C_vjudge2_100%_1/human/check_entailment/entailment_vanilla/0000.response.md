Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program precomputes the sum of the numbers on the board for all possible values of n from 1 to 200000 and stores them in an array A.
3. The program then reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads the value of n and prints the corresponding sum from the array A.
4. The function func_1 calculates the sum of the digits of a given number num.
5. The program uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sum in the array A.
6. The time complexity of the program is O(200000 * log(200000)) due to the while loop in func_1, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
