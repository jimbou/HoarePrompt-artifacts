Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 in an array A.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by using a while loop to extract each digit from the number and add it to the sum.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the largest number `n` that Vladislav writes. It then prints the sum of the numbers on the board for the given `n` by accessing the pre-computed value in the array A.

The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
