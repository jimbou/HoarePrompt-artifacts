Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `a` and assigned it the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged condition on `num` and the new information about `a`.
