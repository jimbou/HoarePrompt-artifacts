#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: a is the sum of the digits of the initial value of num, and num is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the initial value of num, which is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the digits of a given positive integer, leaving the input integer as 0.
