Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 in the list A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number n.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit (num % 10) and adding it to the sum, and then removing the last digit (num = int(num / 10)).

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1, 2, or 200,000. The pre-computation approach ensures that the program can handle large inputs within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
