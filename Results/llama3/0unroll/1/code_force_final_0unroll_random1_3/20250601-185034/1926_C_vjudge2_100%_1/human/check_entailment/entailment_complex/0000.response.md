Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A.

The program then reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads an integer n and prints the corresponding sum from the precomputed array A.

The function func_1 is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given positive integer. It iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to the sum, and then removes the digit from the number.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the following aspects:

1.  The precomputation approach is correct because it calculates the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000, which covers the entire range of possible inputs.
2.  The function func_1 is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a given positive integer.
3.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input integers for each test case.
4.  The program correctly prints the corresponding sum from the precomputed array A for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
