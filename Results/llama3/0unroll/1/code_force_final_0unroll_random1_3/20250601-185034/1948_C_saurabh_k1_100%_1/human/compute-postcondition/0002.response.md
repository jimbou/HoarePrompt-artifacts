Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings a and b of length n. It checks if there are any pairs of adjacent characters in a and b that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it prints 'No' and moves on to the next test case. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it prints 'yes'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
