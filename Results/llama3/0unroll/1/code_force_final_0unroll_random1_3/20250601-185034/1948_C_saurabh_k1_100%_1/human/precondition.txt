stdin contains a sequence of lines where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two lines each containing a string of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
