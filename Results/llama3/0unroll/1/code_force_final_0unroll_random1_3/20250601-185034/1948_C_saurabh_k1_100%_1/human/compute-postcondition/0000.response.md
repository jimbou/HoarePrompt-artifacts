Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n), then two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even and 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.**

The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (n), then two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even and 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5. The value of `t` is equal to the number of test cases.
