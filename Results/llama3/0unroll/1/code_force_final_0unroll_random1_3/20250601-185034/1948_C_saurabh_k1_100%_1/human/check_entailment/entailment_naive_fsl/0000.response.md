Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print "No" because it finds a pair of '<' arrows in the first and second rows, but it does not consider the case where the robot can move up and then follow the '>' arrow to reach the cell (2, n).

A correct solution would need to consider all possible moves of the robot and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows. The current program only checks for a specific pattern of '<' arrows and does not consider other possible paths.
