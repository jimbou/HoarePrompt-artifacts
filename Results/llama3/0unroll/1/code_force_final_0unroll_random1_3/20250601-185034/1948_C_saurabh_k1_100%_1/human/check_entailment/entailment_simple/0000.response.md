Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each pair of adjacent columns, it checks if the arrows in the current column of both rows point to the left ('<'). If such a pair is found, it means that the robot cannot move to the right from this position, and therefore it cannot reach the cell (2, n). In this case, the program prints 'No' and moves on to the next test case.

If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it means that the robot can always move to the right and eventually reach the cell (2, n). In this case, the program prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement, including the fact that n is even and the total length of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Correctness: **True**
