Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, checking if there are any pairs of adjacent characters in the two rows that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it means that the robot cannot move forward and will be stuck in an infinite loop, so it prints 'No' and moves on to the next test case. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it means that the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the fact that n is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid. It also correctly processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.

Correctness: **True**
