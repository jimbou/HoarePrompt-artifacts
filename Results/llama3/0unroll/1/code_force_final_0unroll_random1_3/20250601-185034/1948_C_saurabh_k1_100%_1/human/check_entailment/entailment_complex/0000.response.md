Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the grid in steps of 2, checking if there are any pairs of adjacent characters in the two strings that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it means that the robot cannot move forward and will be stuck in an infinite loop, so it prints 'No'. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it means that the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem, such as the grid having 2 rows and n columns, n being even, and the total length of all strings over all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.

Correctness: **True**
