Output State: **The loop will execute t times, each time reading three inputs from stdin: an integer n and two strings a and b of length n. It will then check if there are any pairs of adjacent characters in a and b that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it will print 'No' and move on to the next test case. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it will print 'yes'. The total length of all strings over all test cases will not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
