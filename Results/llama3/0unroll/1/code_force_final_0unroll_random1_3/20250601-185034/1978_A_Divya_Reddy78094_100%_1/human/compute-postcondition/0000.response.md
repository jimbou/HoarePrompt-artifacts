The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. This means that the first input is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which is assigned to `t`.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and stdin contains the remaining input, which is t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
