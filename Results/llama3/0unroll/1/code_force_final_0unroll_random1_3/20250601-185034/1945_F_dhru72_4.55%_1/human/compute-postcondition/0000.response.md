Output State: **`T` is a type variable, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The first list of integers contains positive integers. The second list of integers is a permutation of integers from 1 to the first integer.**

The code defines a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. This does not affect the values of any variables or the input in stdin. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the type variable `T`.
