Output State: **The output state will contain 2t strings, each representing the maximum and minimum possible numbers that can be formed by comparing the corresponding digits of the input numbers x and y. The comparison starts from the most significant digit and continues until a mismatch is found. After the mismatch, the remaining digits are compared in reverse order. The resulting strings will have the same number of digits as the input numbers.**
