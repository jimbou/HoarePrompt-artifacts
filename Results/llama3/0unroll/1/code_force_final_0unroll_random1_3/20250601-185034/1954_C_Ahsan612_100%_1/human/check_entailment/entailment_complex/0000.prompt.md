Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t integers x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same number of digits.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: The output state will contain 2t strings, each representing the maximum and minimum possible numbers that can be formed by comparing the corresponding digits of the input numbers x and y. The comparison starts from the most significant digit and continues until a mismatch is found. After the mismatch, the remaining digits are compared in reverse order. The resulting strings will have the same number of digits as the input numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers x and y, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and having the same number of digits. It then generates two new numbers by comparing the corresponding digits of x and y. The comparison starts from the most significant digit and continues until a mismatch is found. After the mismatch, the remaining digits are compared in reverse order. The function prints the maximum and minimum possible numbers that can be formed by this comparison, one per line, for each test case.
