This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers x and y, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and having the same number of digits. It then generates two new numbers by comparing the corresponding digits of x and y. The comparison starts from the most significant digit and continues until a mismatch is found. After the mismatch, the remaining digits are compared in reverse order. The function prints the maximum and minimum possible numbers that can be formed by this comparison, one per line, for each test case.
