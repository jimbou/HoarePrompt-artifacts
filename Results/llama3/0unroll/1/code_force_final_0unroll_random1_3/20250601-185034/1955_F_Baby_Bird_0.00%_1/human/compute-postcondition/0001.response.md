Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. It then processes each test case by rounding down each integer to the nearest even number, checks if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 2 equals 3, and prints the sum of the rounded integers divided by 2 plus 1 if the condition is met, or just the sum of the rounded integers divided by 2 otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case and does not return any value.**
