Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks all possible cases:

- If n is equal to m, it is possible to have a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times.
- If m is greater than n, it is not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can only put 1 cube on top of the tower at a time.
- If m is equal to n - 1, it is possible to have a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n - 1 times and then removing 1 cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it is possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower an even or odd number of times and then remove 1 cube an even or odd number of times.
- In all other cases, it is not possible to have a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints "Yes" if it is possible to have a tower with m cubes and "No" otherwise.
