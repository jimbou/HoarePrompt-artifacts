Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program iterates through each test case, reading the values of n and m from the input.

The program's logic is based on the following conditions:

1. If n equals m, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes, so the output is 'Yes'.
2. If m is greater than n, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes, so the output is 'No'.
3. If m is one less than n, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes, so the output is 'Yes'.
4. If both m and n are even or both are odd, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes, so the output is 'Yes'.
5. In all other cases, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes, so the output is 'No'.

The program's logic correctly covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
