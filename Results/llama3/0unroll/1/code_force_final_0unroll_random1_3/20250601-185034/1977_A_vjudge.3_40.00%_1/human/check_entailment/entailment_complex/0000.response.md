Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following conditions:

- If n and m are equal, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding n cubes.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding n-1 cubes and then removing one cube.
- If both n and m are even or both odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
