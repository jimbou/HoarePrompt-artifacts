Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m.

1. If n == m, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can simply add 1 cube at a time to reach m cubes.

2. If m > n, the program prints 'No', which is correct because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If m == n - 1, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add n-1 cubes and then remove 1 cube to reach m cubes.

4. The program then checks the parity of n and m. If both are even or both are odd, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach an even number of cubes, and if both n and m are odd, Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs and then add or remove one more cube to reach an odd number of cubes.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is not sufficient to guarantee that Nikita can obtain a tower with m cubes. For example, if n = 5 and m = 4, Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 1 cube to reach 3 cubes, but he cannot reach 4 cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
