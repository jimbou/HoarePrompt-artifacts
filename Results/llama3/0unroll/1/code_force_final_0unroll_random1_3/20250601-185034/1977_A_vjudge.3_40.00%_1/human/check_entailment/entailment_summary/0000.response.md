Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program works by iterating through each test case and checking the following conditions:

1. If n is equal to m, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n times in a row.
2. If m is greater than n, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot put more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If m is one less than n, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n-1 times and then remove 1 cube.
4. If both m and n are even or both are odd, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put or remove cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
