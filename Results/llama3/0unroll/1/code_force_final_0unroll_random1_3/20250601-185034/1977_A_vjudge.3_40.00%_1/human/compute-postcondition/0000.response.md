The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100)**
