Output State: **The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the smallest multiple of all the integers in the corresponding sublist of `test_cases` that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist.**

In other words, the program returns a list of results, where each result is the smallest multiple that satisfies the conditions specified in the corresponding sublist of `test_cases`. This means that for each sublist, the program finds the smallest multiple that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist and is also a multiple of all the other integers in the sublist.
