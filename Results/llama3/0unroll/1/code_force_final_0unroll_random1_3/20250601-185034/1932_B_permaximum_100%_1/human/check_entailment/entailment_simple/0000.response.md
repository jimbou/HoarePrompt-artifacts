Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the list of periodicities. For each periodicity, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, taking into account whether the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity or not. The program then appends the final year to the results list.

The program's logic is correct, as it accurately implements the problem's requirements. It correctly calculates the next year for each sign, considering whether the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity or not. The program also handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity, in which case it simply adds the periodicity to the current year.

The program's output is also correct, as it returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the smallest multiple of all the integers in the corresponding sublist of `test_cases` that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
