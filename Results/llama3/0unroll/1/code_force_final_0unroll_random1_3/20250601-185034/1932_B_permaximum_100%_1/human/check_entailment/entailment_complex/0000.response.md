Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs provided in the input.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, taking into account the current year and the periodicity of the sign. The current year is updated to the next year in which the sign will occur.

The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity of the sign, and the case where the current year is not a multiple of the periodicity of the sign. In the latter case, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year.

The program returns a list of the years in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
