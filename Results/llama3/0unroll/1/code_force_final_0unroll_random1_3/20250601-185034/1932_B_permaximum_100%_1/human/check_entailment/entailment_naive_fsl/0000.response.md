Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which all n signs will occur according to the Chaya tribe's legend. The program iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next year when the sign will occur, taking into account whether the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity or not.

The program correctly handles the case where the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity by adding the periodicity to the current year to get the next year. If the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the program calculates the next year by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity.

The program also correctly handles the case where the signs occur sequentially, as required by the legend. The program updates the current year after each sign's occurrence, ensuring that the next sign's occurrence is calculated based on the correct current year.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
