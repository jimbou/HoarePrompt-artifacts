    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list of positive integers, where each integer is the smallest multiple of all the integers in the corresponding sublist of `test_cases` that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the smallest multiple of all the integers in the corresponding sublist of `test_cases` that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the smallest multiple of all integers in each sublist of test_cases that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist, and returns a list of these multiples. It accepts a positive integer t and a list of lists test_cases as input, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers. The function iterates over each sublist, calculates the smallest multiple, and appends it to the results list. The final state of the program is a list of positive integers, where each integer is the smallest multiple of all integers in the corresponding sublist of test_cases that is greater than or equal to the first integer in the sublist.
