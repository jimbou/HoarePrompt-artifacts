Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and stores it in the variable `t`.
2. It then reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` for each test case, and stores them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.
3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `t` and `test_cases` as input.
4. Inside `func_1`, the program iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
5. For each test case, it initializes a variable `current_year` to 0.
6. It then iterates over each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
7. For each `ai`, it checks if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. If it is, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
8. It then updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
9. After iterating over all periodicities, it appends the final value of `current_year` to the list `results`.
10. Finally, it returns the list `results`.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. It correctly calculates the year in which each sign will occur, taking into account the periodicities of the signs and the fact that the signs must occur sequentially.

Correctness: **True**
