Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results`, which is an empty list.
