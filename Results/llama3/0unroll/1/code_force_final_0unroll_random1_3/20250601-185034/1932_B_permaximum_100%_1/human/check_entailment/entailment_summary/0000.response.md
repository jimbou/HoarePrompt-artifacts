Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the list of sign periodicities. For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur, taking into account the current year and the sign's periodicity. The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, and the case where it is not.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur, which is the year when the apocalypse will happen. The execution summary also confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
