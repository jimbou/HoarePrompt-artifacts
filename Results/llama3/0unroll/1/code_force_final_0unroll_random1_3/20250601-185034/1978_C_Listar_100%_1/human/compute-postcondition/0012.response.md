Output State: **The program returns two values: a positive integer `n` and a non-negative even integer `k`. If `n` is odd, the maximum possible value of `k` is `(n+1)/2` times `k`. If `n` is even, the maximum possible value of `k` is `2m`. The returned `k` is larger than or equal to the original `k`.**
