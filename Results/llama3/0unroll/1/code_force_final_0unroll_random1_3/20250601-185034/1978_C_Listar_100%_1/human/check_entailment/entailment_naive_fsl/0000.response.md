Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input is (n, k) = (5, 3). The program should output "No" because there is no permutation of length 5 with a Manhattan value of 3. However, the program outputs "Yes" and a permutation that does not satisfy the condition.

The issue lies in the function func_1, which does not correctly handle the case when k is odd. The function tries to find a permutation by swapping elements in the list, but it does not check if the resulting permutation has a Manhattan value equal to k. In the case of (n, k) = (5, 3), the function returns a permutation that has a Manhattan value of 4, not 3.

To fix this issue, the function func_1 should be modified to correctly handle the case when k is odd, and it should check if the resulting permutation has a Manhattan value equal to k.
