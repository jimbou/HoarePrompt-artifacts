Output State: **n and k are returned values from func_4(), n is not equal to 0, l is the returned value from func_1(n, k)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the returned value from `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` and `k` are returned values from `func_4()` and `n` is not equal to 0, the value of `l` depends on the output of `func_1(n, k)`. The second line calls `func_5(l)`, but since the return value of `func_5(l)` is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the state of the program.

Therefore, the final state includes the initial state of `n` and `k` as returned values from `func_4()`, with `n` not equal to 0, and the new variable `l` which is the returned value from `func_1(n, k)`.
