This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either two zeros or the original `n` and `k` values, depending on the parity of `k` and the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is odd, the function immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, the function calculates a maximum possible value for `k` based on `n` and returns two zeros if `k` exceeds this maximum value. Otherwise, the function returns the original `n` and `k` values.
