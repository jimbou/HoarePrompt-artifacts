Functionality: **This function takes no parameters and returns nothing. It retrieves two integer values, n and k, from another function (func_4) and checks if n is 0. If n is 0, it prints 'NO' and ends. If n is not 0, it calls another function (func_1) with n and k as arguments, stores the result in l, and then calls a third function (func_5) with l as an argument. The function then concludes without returning any value.**
