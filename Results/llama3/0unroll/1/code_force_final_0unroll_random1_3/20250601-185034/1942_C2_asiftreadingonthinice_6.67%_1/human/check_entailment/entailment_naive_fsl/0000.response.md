Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the chosen vertices are not distinct. In the problem description, it is stated that the input consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. However, the program does not check for this condition and assumes that the input is always valid.

For example, if the input is:

3
8 4 2
1 1 2 5

The program will produce an incorrect result because the chosen vertices are not distinct.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the input vertices are distinct. This can be done by converting the list of vertices to a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to the length of the list. If they are not equal, it means that there are duplicate vertices and the program should handle this case accordingly.
