This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the given array a permutation of consecutive integers, considering the constraints imposed by the values of x and y. The function then prints the minimum number of operations required for each test case, capping the result at n-2. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output for each test case.
