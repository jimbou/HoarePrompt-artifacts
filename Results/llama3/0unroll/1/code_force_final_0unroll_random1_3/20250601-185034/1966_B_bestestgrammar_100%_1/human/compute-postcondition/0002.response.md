Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. The output will indicate whether it is possible to transform the first row and column of the grid into the last row and column by changing only one cell at a time, with the constraint that the entire grid must remain a valid chessboard pattern at each step. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs will be equal to the value of t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.**
