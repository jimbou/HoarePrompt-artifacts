The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. It then determines whether it is possible to transform the first row and column of the grid into the last row and column by changing only one cell at a time, while maintaining a valid chessboard pattern at each step. The function prints 'YES' to the console for each test case where such a transformation is possible, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of outputs is equal to the number of test cases provided in the input.
