Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. 1 <= n, m <= 500, and the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each containing two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. The constraints on n, m, and the sum of n*m over all test cases remain the same.
