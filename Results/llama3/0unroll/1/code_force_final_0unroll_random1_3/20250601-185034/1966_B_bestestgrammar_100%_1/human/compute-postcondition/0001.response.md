Output State: The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to a test case. The string is 'YES' if the top-left and bottom-right characters of the grid are the same, or if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first row, last row, first column, or last column that are different. Otherwise, the string is 'NO'. The number of strings in the output state is equal to the initial value of `t`.
