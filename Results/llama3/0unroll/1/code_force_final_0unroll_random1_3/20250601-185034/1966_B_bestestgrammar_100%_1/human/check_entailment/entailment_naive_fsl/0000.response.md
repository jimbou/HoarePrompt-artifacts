Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, and if not, it checks if there are any adjacent squares of the same color in the top row or left column. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
WBWB
WBWB
WBWB
WBWB
```

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, and there are no adjacent squares of the same color in the top row or left column. However, it is still possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them the same color.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
