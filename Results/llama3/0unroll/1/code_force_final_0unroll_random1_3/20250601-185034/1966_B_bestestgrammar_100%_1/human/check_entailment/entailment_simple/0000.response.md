Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program iterates through each test case, reads the grid, and checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color. If they do not, it checks if there is a row or column where all cells have the same color, which would make it impossible to make all squares the same color. If such a row or column is found, the program outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make all squares the same color, which are:

1. The top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors.
2. There is a row or column where all cells have the same color.

If neither of these conditions is met, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the necessary operations.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
