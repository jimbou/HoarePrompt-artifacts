Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it then checks if there is a row or column where all cells are the same color, and if there is a cell that is different from the top-left and bottom-right corners. If such a row or column is found, it sets the answer to 'NO'. Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'YES'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, then it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing operations. If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, then it is only possible to make all squares the same color if there is a row or column where all cells are the same color, and if there is a cell that is different from the top-left and bottom-right corners.

The program's execution summary shows that it correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares the same color for each test case, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
