Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the line where it prints the result. The program always prints 'Alice', regardless of the value of the variable 'dp'. This means that even when 'dp' is False, the program will still print 'Alice', which is incorrect according to the problem description.

A correct implementation should print 'Alice' when 'dp' is True and 'Bob' when 'dp' is False. The corrected line should be:

print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
