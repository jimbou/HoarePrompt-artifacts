Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the last line of the code, where it prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of the variable 'dp'. The correct code should print 'Alice' if 'dp' is True and 'Bob' if 'dp' is False. 

The variable 'dp' is used to track whether the difference between consecutive integers in the sorted array is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, 'dp' remains True, indicating that Alice wins. If no such difference is found, 'dp' becomes False, indicating that Bob wins. However, the current code ignores the value of 'dp' and always prints 'Alice'.

Correctness: **False**
