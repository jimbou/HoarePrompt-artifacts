Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `tc` has been assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, but the structure of each test case remains the same, with two inputs: an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
