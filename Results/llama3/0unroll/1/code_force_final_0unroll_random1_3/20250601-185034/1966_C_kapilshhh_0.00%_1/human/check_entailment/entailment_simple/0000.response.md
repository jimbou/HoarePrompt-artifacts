Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the last line of the program, where it prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. It should print 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` and 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`. However, the program always prints 'Alice', which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
