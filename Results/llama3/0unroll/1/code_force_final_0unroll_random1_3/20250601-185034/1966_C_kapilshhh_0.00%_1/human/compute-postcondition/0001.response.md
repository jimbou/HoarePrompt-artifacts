Output State: **tc = 0, n = 0, arr = [], dp = True**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the test case counter `tc` is reset to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` is also reset to 0, as it is reinitialized to the length of the input array minus 1 in each iteration. The array `arr` is empty, as it is reinitialized in each iteration with the input values. The variable `dp` is set to True, as it is initialized to True in each iteration and only updated if the difference between two consecutive elements in the sorted array is greater than 1.
