Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow (k). The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and the Cowdeforces ratings are distinct integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
