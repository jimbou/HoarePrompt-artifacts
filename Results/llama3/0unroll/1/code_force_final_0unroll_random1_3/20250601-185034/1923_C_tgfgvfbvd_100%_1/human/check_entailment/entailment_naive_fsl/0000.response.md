Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program first calculates the prefix sum of the array and the count of 1's in the array. Then, for each query, it checks if the subarray is good by verifying that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for a subarray to be good, as it ensures that there exists an integer array b such that the sum of b is equal to the sum of the subarray, all elements of b are positive, and all elements of b are different from the corresponding elements in the subarray.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it is not good. The program also handles the case where the subarray has no 1's, in which case the condition for being good is simply that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is non-negative.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + q), where n is the length of the array and q is the number of queries.
