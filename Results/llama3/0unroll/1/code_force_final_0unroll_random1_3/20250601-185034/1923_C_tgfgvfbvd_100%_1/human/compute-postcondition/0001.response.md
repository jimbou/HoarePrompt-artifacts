Functionality: **This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if a certain condition is met within a specified range of the array and outputs 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all test cases and queries, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs indicating the result of each query.**
