Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates two prefix sum arrays, `p` and `c`, where `p` stores the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`, and `c` stores the cumulative count of 1's in the array `l`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of elements and the count of 1's in any subarray in constant time.
3. For each query, the program calculates the sum of elements and the count of 1's in the subarray `[a, b]` using the prefix sum arrays.
4. It then checks the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, where `s` is the sum of elements in the subarray, `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray, and `i` is the count of 1's in the subarray. This condition is equivalent to checking if there exists an integer array `b` of length `m` such that the conditions 1, 2, and 3 in the problem statement are satisfied.
5. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the output state matches the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
