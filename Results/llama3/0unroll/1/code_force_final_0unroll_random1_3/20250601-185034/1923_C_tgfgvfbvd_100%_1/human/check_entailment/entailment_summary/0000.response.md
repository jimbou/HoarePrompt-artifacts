Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the number of queries.
2. It then reads the array elements and calculates the prefix sum and the count of 1's in the array.
3. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of 1's in the subarray.
4. It then checks if the subarray is good by verifying the conditions:
   - The subarray has more than one element.
   - The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray.
5. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
