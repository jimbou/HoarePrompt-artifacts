Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the condition s - (b - a + 1) >= i is met for the given range [a, b]. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs is equal to the number of test cases (t) multiplied by the number of queries (m) for each test case. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.**
