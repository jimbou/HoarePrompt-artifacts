Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program iterates through each test case, processes the input array and queries, and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good":

1.  The sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the corresponding subarray of array b.
2.  The elements in the subarray are not equal to the corresponding elements in array b.
3.  All elements in array b are greater than 0.

The program uses prefix sums (`p`) to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in the subarray and a separate array (`c`) to count the number of 1's in the subarray. This allows it to check the conditions for each query in constant time.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the subarray has only one element or when the sum of the elements in the subarray is less than the number of elements in the subarray.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
