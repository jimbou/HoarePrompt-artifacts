Precondition: **stdin contains a series of inputs: the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), the second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 10^9), and then q lines each containing two integers l_i and r_i (1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n).**
