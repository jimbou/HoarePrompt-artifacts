Functionality: **This function determines the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers in a given list of non-negative integers and prints the length of the list if no such sequence is found. It takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns no value, instead printing the result directly. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.**
