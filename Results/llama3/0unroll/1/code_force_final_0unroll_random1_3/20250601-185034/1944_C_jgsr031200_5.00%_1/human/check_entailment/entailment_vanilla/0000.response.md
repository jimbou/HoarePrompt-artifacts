Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a counter `nums` to count the frequency of each number in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the current number is present in the counter. If it is, it decrements the count and moves to the next number. If the next number is also present in the counter, it decrements its count and moves to the next number. This process continues until it finds a number that is not present in the counter or the count of the current number becomes 0.

The program then prints the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, which is the MEX of the array.

The time complexity of the program is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the counter.

Based on the problem description and the provided program, it appears that the program is correct and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
