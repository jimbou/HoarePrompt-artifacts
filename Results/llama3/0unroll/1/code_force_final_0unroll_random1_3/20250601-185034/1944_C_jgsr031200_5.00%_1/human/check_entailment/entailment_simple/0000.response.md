Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a counter `nums` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the counter, starting from 0, and for each element, it checks if it exists in the counter. If it does, it decrements the count and moves to the next element. If it doesn't, it prints the current element plus one, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

The program also maintains a set `vis` to keep track of the elements that have been visited. However, this set is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
