Output State: **nums is a dictionary where all values are 0, vis is a set containing all elements from arr, start is the length of arr, and arr remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the dictionary `nums` will have all its values set to 0, indicating that all elements from the list `arr` have been processed. The set `vis` will contain all elements from `arr`, indicating that all elements have been visited. The variable `start` will be equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has traversed the entire list. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
