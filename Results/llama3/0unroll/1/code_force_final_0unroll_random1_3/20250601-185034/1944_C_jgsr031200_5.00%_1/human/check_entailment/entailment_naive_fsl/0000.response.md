Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the numbers from 0 to `n` and checking if they are present in the array. If a number is present, it is removed from the array and the next number is checked. If a number is not present, it is printed as the MEX.

The program also handles the case where the array `a` contains duplicate numbers. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each number in the array, and the `nums` dictionary is used to keep track of the remaining numbers in the array.

The program also handles the case where the array `a` is empty. In this case, the MEX is 0, which is correctly printed by the program.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all potential cases.
