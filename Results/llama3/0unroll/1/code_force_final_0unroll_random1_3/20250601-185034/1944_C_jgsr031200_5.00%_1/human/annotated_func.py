#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: nums is a dictionary where all values are 0, vis is a set containing all elements from arr, start is the length of arr, and arr remains unchanged.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the length of the list arr

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers in a given list of non-negative integers and prints the length of the list if no such sequence is found. It takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns no value, instead printing the result directly. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
