Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `nums` dictionary is created by counting the occurrences of each element in `arr` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. The `start` variable is initialized to 0, and the `vis` set is initialized as an empty set.
