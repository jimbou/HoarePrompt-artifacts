Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The provided program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string. It then prints the sum of these counts, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, this approach is incorrect. The reason is that the `count` method counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings, but it does not consider the case where the substrings overlap. For example, in the string "mapmap", the `count` method would count two occurrences of "map", but deleting two characters would not make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different approach that takes into account overlapping occurrences of the substrings. One possible approach is to use a sliding window technique to iterate over the string and count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
