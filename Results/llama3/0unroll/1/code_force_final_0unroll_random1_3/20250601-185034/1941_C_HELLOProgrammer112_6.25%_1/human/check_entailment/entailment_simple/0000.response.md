Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s and prints their sum, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program uses the built-in count() method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the string. This method is efficient and accurate for counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in each string s.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases t, the length of each string n, and the string s itself from the standard input. It then prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string s.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
