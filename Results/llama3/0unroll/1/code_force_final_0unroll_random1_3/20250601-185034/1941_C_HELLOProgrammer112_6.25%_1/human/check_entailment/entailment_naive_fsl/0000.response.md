Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the case where the string "map" and "pie" overlap. For example, in the string "mapie", the program will count it as two separate occurrences of "map" and "pie", but in reality, it should only count as one occurrence of the overlapping substring "mapie". 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a sliding window or a regular expression, to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string, taking into account the possibility of overlapping substrings. 

Here is an example of a correct solution:
```
import re

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = len(re.findall('map|pie', s))
        print(x)
```
This solution uses the `re.findall` function to find all occurrences of "map" or "pie" in the string, and then prints the length of the resulting list, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
