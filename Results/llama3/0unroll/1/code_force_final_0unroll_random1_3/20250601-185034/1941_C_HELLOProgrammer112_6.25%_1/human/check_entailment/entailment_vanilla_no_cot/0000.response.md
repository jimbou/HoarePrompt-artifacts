Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where 'map' and 'pie' overlap in the string.

For example, in the string "mapie", the program would count 1 occurrence of 'map' and 1 occurrence of 'pie', resulting in a total count of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, only 1 character needs to be removed, which is the 'p' in 'mapie'.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the string and check for the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' while considering the overlap.
