Reasoning: 

The given program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It correctly reads the input, updates the game state based on the actions, and prints the final score. The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when a player scores in their own goal or when a player is eliminated.

However, there are a few potential issues that could be considered:

1. The program assumes that the input is valid and does not contain any errors. In a real-world scenario, it would be better to add error checking to handle invalid input.
2. The program uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to encapsulate the game state and functions into a class or module.
3. The program uses a lot of magic numbers (e.g., 3, 99, 10), which can make the code harder to understand. It would be better to define these numbers as constants or enumerations.

Despite these potential issues, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
