This function simulates a game where two teams, 'B' and 'W', compete to score points by moving elements on a grid. The game starts with an initial grid configuration, where each team has a player and a goal. The function reads a series of commands from standard input, which specify movements or actions for the elements on the grid. The function updates the grid and the elements' positions accordingly, keeping track of the score and the status of each player. The game ends after a specified number of iterations, and the final score is printed to the console. The function also prints messages to the console when a player is eliminated, a goal is scored, or a player catches the golden snitch.
