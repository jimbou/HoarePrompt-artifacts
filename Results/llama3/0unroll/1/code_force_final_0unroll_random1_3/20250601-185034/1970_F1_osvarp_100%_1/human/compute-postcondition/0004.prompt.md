Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The grid is populated with n lines of input from stdin, where each line is a list of strings. The elements dictionary is updated to include the positions of all non-'..' elements in the grid. The allPlayers dictionary is populated with player elements from the grid, initially set to False. The goal list contains lists of positions of 'G' elements in the grid, separated by player ('B' or 'W'). The values of n, m, stdin, and points remain unchanged. t is assigned the value of an integer read from stdin.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
