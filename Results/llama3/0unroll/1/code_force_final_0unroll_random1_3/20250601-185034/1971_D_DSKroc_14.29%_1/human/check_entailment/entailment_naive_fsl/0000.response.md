Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0', which indicates a cut is needed. The program then adds 1 to this count, because the first piece does not require a cut.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if the input string is already sorted, the program will output 1, because no cuts are needed. If the input string is not sorted, the program will output the correct number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string is a single character, or when the input string is empty. In these cases, the program will output 1, which is the correct result.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
