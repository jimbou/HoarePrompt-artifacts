Output State: **The program returns a string 'result' formed by concatenating the characters from the sorted prefix_balance list, where prefix_balance is a sorted list of n tuples containing the balance of the string s up to the corresponding index, the index itself, and the character at that index in s, sorted by balance and then by index in descending order, and balance is 0.**
