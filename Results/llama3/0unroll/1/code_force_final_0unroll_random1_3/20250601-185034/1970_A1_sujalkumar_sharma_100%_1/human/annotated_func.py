#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: prefix_balance is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of the string s up to the corresponding index, the index itself, and the character at that index in s, balance is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string 'result' formed by concatenating the characters from the sorted prefix_balance list, where prefix_balance is a sorted list of n tuples containing the balance of the string s up to the corresponding index, the index itself, and the character at that index in s, sorted by balance and then by index in descending order, and balance is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on the balance of the string up to each index and the index itself in descending order, and returns a new string formed by concatenating the sorted characters. The function effectively rearranges the input string while maintaining the balance of the parentheses.
