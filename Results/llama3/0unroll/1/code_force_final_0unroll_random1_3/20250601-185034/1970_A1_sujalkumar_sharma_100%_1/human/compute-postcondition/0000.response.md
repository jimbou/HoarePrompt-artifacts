Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is an empty list, balance is 0**

The code initializes three variables: `n`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance`. The value of `n` is set to the length of the string `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The `prefix_balance` list is initialized as an empty list, and the `balance` variable is set to 0. The state of `s` remains unchanged.
