Output State: **t is an integer equal to the input value, a and b are positive integers, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a string**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since the input is prompted as 'Enter the number of test cases:', it is expected to be a positive integer. The second line initializes an empty list `results`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Stdin now contains one input, which is a string (the input for `t`).
