Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn, and that the players take turns exchanging wallets and removing 1 coin from their current wallet. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Function 1 correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who makes the last move wins. Since the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will always have the opportunity to make the last move, and therefore wins.

Function 2 correctly reads the input, calls Function 1 to determine the winner for each pair of input values, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
