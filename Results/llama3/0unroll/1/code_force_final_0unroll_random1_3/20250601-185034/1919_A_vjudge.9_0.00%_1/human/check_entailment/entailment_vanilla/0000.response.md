Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns a string indicating the winner of the game.

The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who removes the last coin loses. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be the one to remove the last coin, and if it's odd, Alice will.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
