Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and explains the rules of the game.

Function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the winner ('Bob' or 'Alice') based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This function seems to be implementing the game's winning condition, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description but can be inferred from the examples.

Function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and input values for `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each pair of input values, and prints the results.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b`, and `func_2` correctly reads input values and prints the results. However, the problem description does not explicitly state the winning condition, and the examples do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, it is unclear whether the functions correctly implement the game's rules.

Correctness: **False**
