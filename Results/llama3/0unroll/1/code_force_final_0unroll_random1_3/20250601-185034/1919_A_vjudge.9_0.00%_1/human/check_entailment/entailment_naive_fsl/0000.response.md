Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because Alice will always be left with an odd number of coins, forcing her to make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, allowing him to win.

If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of coins, allowing her to win.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and returning "Bob" if it's even and "Alice" if it's odd.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
