Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The task is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns a string indicating the winner of the game.

The logic of `func_1` is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who removes the last coin loses. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be able to remove the last coin, while if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always be able to remove the last coin.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`. It calls `func_1` with these values and appends the result to a list `results`. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the logic of `func_1` and ensuring that it correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Since the program's output matches the expected output for the provided example inputs, it is likely that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
