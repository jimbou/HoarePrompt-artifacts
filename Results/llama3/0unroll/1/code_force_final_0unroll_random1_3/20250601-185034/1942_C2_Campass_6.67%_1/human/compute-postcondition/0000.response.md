Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains t-1 inputs: an integer, followed by t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. The first line of the code snippet reads an integer `t` from standard input using the `R` function and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

Since `t` is an integer and `R` function reads a line from standard input, after executing this line, `t` will be an integer, and stdin will contain `t-1` inputs: an integer, followed by `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`. The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
