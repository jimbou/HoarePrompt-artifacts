Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive, for each test case.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, `l`, `val`, and `cons` are updated according to the loop body for each test case. The final values of these variables are discarded, and only the output of the `print` statement is retained.

The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive, for each test case. This list is the result of the loop executing all its iterations, and it is the final output of the program.
