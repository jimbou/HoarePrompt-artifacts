This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive, considering the constraints provided. The function iterates through each test case, processes the input data, and outputs the minimum number of operations required for each case.
