Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, one for each pair of input integers (a, b). The output will be 'Yes' if either a or b is even and the other number is equal to half of the even number. Otherwise, the output will be 'No'. The value of t will remain unchanged, and the input lines from stdin will be consumed by the loop.**
