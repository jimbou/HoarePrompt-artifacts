The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, but the first line has been consumed. Each of the remaining lines contains two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
