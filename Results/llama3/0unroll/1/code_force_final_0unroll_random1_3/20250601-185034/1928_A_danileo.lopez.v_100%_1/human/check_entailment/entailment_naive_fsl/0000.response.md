Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both odd numbers and a is not equal to b. In this case, the program will print 'No', but it should print 'Yes' because it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

For example, if a = 3 and b = 5, the program will print 'No', but it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides, such as 3 x 2 and 3 x 3.

The program only checks if a or b is even, and if so, it checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If not, it prints 'Yes'. However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all possible cases, and the program fails to handle the case when both a and b are odd numbers and a is not equal to b.
