Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program first reads the number of test cases, t. Then, for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle, a and b.

The program then checks if either a or b is even. If either a or b is even, it calculates the dimensions of the two rectangles that can be formed by cutting the original rectangle in half. If the dimensions of the two rectangles are not the same as the original rectangle, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. If the dimensions of the two rectangles are the same as the original rectangle, it prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

If neither a nor b is even, the program prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
