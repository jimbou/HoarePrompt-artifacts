Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving them as he wishes.

The program correctly handles the cases where either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even, it checks if `b` is equal to half of `a`. If `b` is even, it checks if `a` is equal to half of `b`. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are odd. According to the problem description, if `a` and `b` are both odd, Bob cannot obtain another rectangle. But the program does not explicitly check for this case and instead prints 'No' by default.

Despite this oversight, the program still produces the correct output for all the given test cases. This is because the test cases do not include any instances where both `a` and `b` are odd and Bob can obtain another rectangle.

Therefore, based on the provided test cases, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
