Functionality: **The function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of pairs to follow. For each pair, it checks if either number is even and if the other number is equal to half of the even number. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function consumes all input lines from standard input and does not modify the input values.**
