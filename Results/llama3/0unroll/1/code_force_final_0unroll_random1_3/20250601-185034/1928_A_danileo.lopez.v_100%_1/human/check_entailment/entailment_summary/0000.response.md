Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either of the dimensions (a or b) is even, and if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the cases where the dimensions are odd, in which case it prints 'No' because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle. It also correctly handles the cases where the dimensions are even, but the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension, in which case it prints 'Yes'.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
