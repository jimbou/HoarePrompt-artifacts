This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns the number of values within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The input consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9). The function categorizes the input values based on t: t=1 sets the start of the range, t=2 sets the end of the range, and t=3 adds a value to the list. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the range of values (inclusive) and the number of values in the list that fall within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
