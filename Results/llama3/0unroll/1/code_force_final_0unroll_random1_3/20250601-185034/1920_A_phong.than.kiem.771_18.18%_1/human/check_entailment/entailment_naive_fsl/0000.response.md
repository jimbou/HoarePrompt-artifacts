Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the start and end values to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively, and then iterates over the constraints. For each constraint, it updates the start and end values accordingly. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates the start value to be the maximum of the current start value and the constraint value. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates the end value to be the minimum of the current end value and the constraint value. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds the constraint value to the num list.

After iterating over all constraints, it calculates the count of numbers that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of numbers that do not satisfy the constraints (i.e., the numbers in the num list that are within the range [start, end]) from the total count of numbers in the range [start, end].

The program correctly handles the case where there are no valid integers k that satisfy all constraints, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles the case where the start value is greater than the end value, in which case it returns 0.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
