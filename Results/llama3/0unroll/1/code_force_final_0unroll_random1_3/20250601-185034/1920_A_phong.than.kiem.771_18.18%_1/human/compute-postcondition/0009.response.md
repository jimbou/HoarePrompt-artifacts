Output State: **The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that fall within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum of the initial start and all the v values where t is 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial end and all the v values where t is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.**
