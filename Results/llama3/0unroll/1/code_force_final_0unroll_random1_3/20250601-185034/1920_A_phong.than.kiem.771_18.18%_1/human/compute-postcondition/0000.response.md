Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value of the first input from stdin, which is between 2 and 100. The variable `start` has been initialized to -1, and `end` has been set to 1000000000.0. The list `num` has been created but remains empty. Stdin now contains n lines, each with two integers t and v, where t is between 1 and 3, and v is between 1 and 10^9.
