    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer value 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean value `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it, leaving `isOne` unchanged. If `isOne` is True, it returns the integer value 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :

        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is true, the list contains integers converted from strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, the list contains integers converted from characters in `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings or characters. If `space` is true, the list contains strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, the list contains individual characters in `line`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes user input as a string and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, it splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by spaces. If `space` is false, it converts the input string into a list of individual characters. Then, if `to_int` is true, it converts each item in the list into an integer. The function returns the resulting list, which can contain either integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

    return string
    #The program returns a string containing all elements of the list 'arr' converted to strings and concatenated with the string 'sym' in between each element.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values of any type and a string as input, converts each element in the list to a string, and concatenates them with the input string in between each element, returning the resulting concatenated string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.

    #State: indices is a list of all indices of substring in string, index is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of all indices of a substring in a string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns all occurrences of a given substring within a string by providing a list of indices where the substring starts. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value of any type
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the value in the list 'arr' is equal to 'element'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of integers, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is an integer.

    #State: The loop will return the first sub-array in arr where the element at the specified index is equal to the given value. If no such sub-array is found, the loop will not return anything (i.e., it will implicitly return None). The state of the other variables (arr, index, and value) remains unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-array in 'arr' was found where the element at the specified 'index' is equal to the given 'value'. The state of 'arr', 'index', and 'value' remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list of integers for the first sub-array where the element at a specified index matches a given value, returning the matching sub-array if found, otherwise returning None, without modifying the original list or input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).

    #The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that fall within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum of the initial start and all the v values where t is 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial end and all the v values where t is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns the number of values within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The input consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9). The function categorizes the input values based on t: t=1 sets the start of the range, t=2 sets the end of the range, and t=3 adds a value to the list. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the range of values (inclusive) and the number of values in the list that fall within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
