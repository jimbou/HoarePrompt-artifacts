Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Alex has to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The constraints are of three types: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x, k must be less than or equal to some integer x, and k must be not equal to some integer x.

The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is in Function 7. This function reads the input from stdin, which consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9). The function then processes the input and returns the number of values within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers.

The function correctly handles the three types of constraints and calculates the range of possible values for k. It also correctly counts the number of values in the list that fall within this range and returns the difference between the range of values and this count, but only if this difference is non-negative.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
