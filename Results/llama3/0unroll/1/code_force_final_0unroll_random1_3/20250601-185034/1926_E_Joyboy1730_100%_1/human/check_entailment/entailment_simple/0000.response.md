Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the number of cards in each category (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) by using the formula `m = (n + 1) // 2` and subtracting `m` from `n` in each iteration. This is because the number of odd numbers in a range `[1, n]` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and the number of numbers that are twice an odd number is `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, and so on.

2. The program correctly calculates the total number of cards laid down so far (`tot`) and checks if the `k`-th card is in the current category. If it is, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

3. The program correctly updates the `pow` variable to keep track of the current multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).

4. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the total number of cards laid down so far (`tot`).

5. The program correctly prints the value of the `k`-th card for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
