Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given input values.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values from stdin, including the number of test cases `t` and the pairs of values `n` and `k` for each test case.
2.  The program initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards in each iteration of the while loop.
3.  The while loop correctly calculates the number of cards `m` that are laid down in each iteration, which is the ceiling of `n / 2`. This is because Vladislav lays down all the odd-numbered cards first, then all the cards that are twice an odd number, and so on.
4.  The program correctly updates the value of `n` by subtracting `m` from it in each iteration, ensuring that the remaining cards are processed in the next iteration.
5.  The program initializes the variables `tot` and `pow` to keep track of the total number of cards laid down and the current power of 2, respectively.
6.  The for loop correctly iterates over the list `L` and checks if the current card is the `k`-th card laid down. If it is, the program prints the result of the calculation `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, which represents the `k`-th card laid down.
7.  The program correctly updates the values of `tot` and `pow` in each iteration of the for loop, ensuring that the calculation is accurate for each card.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given input values.

Correctness: **True**
