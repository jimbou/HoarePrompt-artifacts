Functionality: **The function reads a series of input values from stdin, where the first value t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent pair of values n and k represents a test case. For each test case, the function calculates a result based on the values of n and k, and prints the result to the output. The function processes all t test cases and produces t output values, each representing the calculated result for the corresponding input values of n and k.**
