The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. After accepting the first integer, `t` lines are left in the stdin. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`**
