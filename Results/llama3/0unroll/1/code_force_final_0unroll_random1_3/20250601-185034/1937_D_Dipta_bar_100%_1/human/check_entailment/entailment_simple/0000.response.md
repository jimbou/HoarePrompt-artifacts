Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of pinballs that have moved to the right and left, respectively. It also initializes two lists, idx_A and idx_B, to store the indices of the cells where the pinballs are placed.

The program then iterates over the string s from left to right and right to left, calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. It uses the values stored in A, B, idx_A, and idx_B to calculate the number of seconds.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball is placed on the leftmost or rightmost cell, and it correctly calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid in these cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
