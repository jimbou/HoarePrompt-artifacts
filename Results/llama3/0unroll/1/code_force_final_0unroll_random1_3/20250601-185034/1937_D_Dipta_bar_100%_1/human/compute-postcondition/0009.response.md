Functionality: **This function takes a string s consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input, representing a one-dimensional grid. It calculates and prints the total number of steps required to move from each position in the grid to the end of the grid, considering the direction of movement indicated by the '<' and '>' characters. The function iterates through the grid, updating the step counts based on the encountered characters and their positions. It handles different scenarios, including moving forward, backward, and staying in place, and prints the calculated step counts for each position in the grid.**
