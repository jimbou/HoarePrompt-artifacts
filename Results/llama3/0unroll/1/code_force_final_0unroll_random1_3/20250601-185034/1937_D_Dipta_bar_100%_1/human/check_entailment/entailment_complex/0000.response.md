Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the number of steps required for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid, considering the direction of movement indicated by '<' and '>' characters. The program iterates through the grid, updating the step counts based on the encountered characters and their positions.

The program correctly handles different scenarios, including moving forward, backward, and staying in place. It also correctly calculates the step counts for each position in the grid, taking into account the direction of movement and the position of the pinball.

The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the step counts for moving forward and backward, respectively. It also uses two lists, idx_A and idx_B, to store the indices of the '<' and '>' characters, respectively. The program iterates through the grid, updating the step counts and indices based on the encountered characters.

The program correctly handles the boundary conditions, including the case where the pinball is placed at the beginning or end of the grid. It also correctly handles the case where the grid consists of only '<' or '>' characters.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
