Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of integers, l is 0, r is the length of B.**

The code initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, without modifying any existing variables. The first line assigns the value 0 to `l`. The second line assigns the length of list `B` to `r`. Since the length of `B` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe `r` as being equal to the length of `B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
