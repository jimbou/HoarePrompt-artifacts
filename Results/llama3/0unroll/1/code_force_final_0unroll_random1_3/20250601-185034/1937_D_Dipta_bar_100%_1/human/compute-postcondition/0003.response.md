Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code creates two new empty lists, B and idx_B, and assigns them to the variables B and idx_B, respectively. The rest of the variables, A, idx_A, s, and n, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
