Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the rules for the pinball movement and calculates the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from each position. The program handles different scenarios, including moving forward, backward, and staying in place, and correctly updates the step counts based on the encountered characters and their positions.

The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative step counts for the '>' and '<' characters, respectively. It then iterates through the grid, using the values in A and B to calculate the total number of steps required to move from each position to the end of the grid. The program handles the edge cases correctly, including when the pinball is placed at the beginning or end of the grid.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
