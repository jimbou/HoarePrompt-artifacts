Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros on the left and the percentage of ones on the right are both greater than or equal to 50%. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the middle index `pk` of the string, taking into account whether the length of the string is even or odd.

2. It correctly counts the total number of zeros and ones in the string.

3. It then iterates through the string, maintaining a count of zeros and ones on the left side of the current index. It calculates the percentage of zeros on the left and ones on the right and checks if both percentages are greater than or equal to 50%. If they are, it adds the current index to the list `lst`.

4. It then finds the minimum absolute difference between the middle index `pk` and the indices in `lst`. This is done to find the index that is closest to the middle of the string.

5. If no index is found that satisfies the condition, it checks if the percentage of ones in the entire string is greater than or equal to 50%. If it is, it adds 0 to the list `final`, otherwise it adds the length of the string.

6. Finally, it sorts the list `final` in ascending order and prints the first element, which is the minimum index that satisfies the condition.

Correctness: **True**
