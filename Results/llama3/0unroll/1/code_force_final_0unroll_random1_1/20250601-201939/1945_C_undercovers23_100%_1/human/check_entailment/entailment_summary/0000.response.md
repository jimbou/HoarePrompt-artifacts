Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros on the left and the percentage of ones on the right are both greater than or equal to 50%. It handles the cases where such an index does not exist and returns the correct value based on the percentage of ones in the entire string. The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the string is even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
