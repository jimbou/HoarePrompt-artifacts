Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros on the left and the percentage of ones on the right are both greater than or equal to 50%. The list is sorted in ascending order. If no such index exists, the list contains either 0 or the length of the input string, depending on whether the percentage of ones in the entire string is greater than or equal to 50% or not.**
