Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings consisting of characters 0 and 1. It then processes each string, counting the minimum number of segments of consecutive 1's or 0's, with the exception that if a string starts with a 0 followed by a 1, the count is reduced by 1. The function prints the count for each string, resulting in t lines of output. The value of t remains unchanged.**
