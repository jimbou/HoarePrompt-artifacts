Output State: **The output will be t lines, each containing an integer. The integer on each line represents the minimum number of segments of consecutive 1's or 0's in the corresponding input string s, with the exception that if a string starts with a 0 followed by a 1, the count is reduced by 1. The value of t remains unchanged.**
