The code snippet appends three new values to the list `ans`. The first line appends the value of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, which is the difference between `k - 1` and the sum of all previous values in `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to 2^(lk-2), the sum of these values is 2^(lk-1) - 1. Therefore, the first appended value is `k - 1 - (2^(lk-1) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2^(lk-1)`.

The second line appends the value of `k + 1`.

The third line appends the value of `2 * k + 1`.

After executing the entire code block, the list `ans` now contains the original powers of 2 from 1 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the three newly appended values: `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer larger than 1, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, ans is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]**
