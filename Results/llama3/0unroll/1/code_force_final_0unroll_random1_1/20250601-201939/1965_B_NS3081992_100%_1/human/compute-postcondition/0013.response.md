Output State: **The program returns a string that contains the length of list 'ans' and the elements of list 'ans'. The length of list 'ans' is an integer. The elements of list 'ans' are integers that include 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1). The variable 'lk' is an integer equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of 'k'. The variable 'l' is an integer equal to the number of digits in string 'b'.**
