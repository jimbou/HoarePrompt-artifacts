Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If k is larger than 1, then the output state is as follows: n is an integer, k is an integer larger than 1, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, ans is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)].***
