This function performs the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and returns the GCD along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity. If 'b' is zero, it returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and 'a'. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function 'func_13' with 'b' and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b', and returns the results along with the calculated coefficients. The function ultimately returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which can be used to express the GCD as a linear combination of 'a' and 'b'.
