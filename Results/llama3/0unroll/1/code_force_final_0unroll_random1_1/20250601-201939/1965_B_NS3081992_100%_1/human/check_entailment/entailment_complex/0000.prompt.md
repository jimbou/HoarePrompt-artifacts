Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Function 5:

The exact value of each element is unknown since the implementation of 'func_7()' is not provided, but it is known that 'rows' is a positive integer, so the list will have at least one element.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The list will have at least one element, as the number of elements is determined by the positive integer 'rows'. The exact values of the elements are unknown, as they depend on the implementation of 'func_7()'.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string

The length of the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` is not equal to 1
    for di in d[da]:

The values of `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key (`da`) in a dictionary (`d`) based on the values associated with that key and the results of recursive calls to `func_12`. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the associated values, temporarily marking them as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate their ranks. The function returns the minimum rank found, plus 1, and updates the `rank` list with this value. The function does not modify the original dictionary (`d`) or the `processing` list.

#Function 13:

    #State: *a and b are integers and b is non-zero
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. y is the second return value of func_13(b, a % b), x is the first return value of func_13(b, a % b), a // b is the integer division of a by b, and g is the third return value of func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and returns the GCD along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity. If 'b' is zero, it returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and 'a'. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function 'func_13' with 'b' and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b', and returns the results along with the calculated coefficients. The function ultimately returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which can be used to express the GCD as a linear combination of 'a' and 'b'.

    #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If k is larger than 1, then the output state is as follows: n is an integer, k is an integer larger than 1, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, ans is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)].

    #The program returns a string that contains the length of list 'ans' and the elements of list 'ans'. The length of list 'ans' is an integer. The elements of list 'ans' are integers that include 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1). The variable 'lk' is an integer equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of 'k'. The variable 'l' is an integer equal to the number of digits in string 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a sequence of integers based on the input parameters n and k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers that includes powers of 2 up to the number of digits in the binary representation of k, followed by k-1 minus the sum of the previous powers of 2, k+1, 2k+1, and then the remaining powers of 2 up to the number of digits in the binary representation of n. The function returns a string containing the length of this list and the list elements themselves.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a non-negative integer, and the function func_14() returns a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):

    #State: Output State: The function func_10() returns a non-negative integer, and the function func_14() returns a string. The loop iterates func_10() times, writing the string returned by func_14() followed by a newline character to the standard output each time.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function writes a string returned by func_14() to the standard output a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by func_10(), with each string followed by a newline character.
