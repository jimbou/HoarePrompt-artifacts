This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key (`da`) in a dictionary (`d`) based on the values associated with that key and the results of recursive calls to `func_12`. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the associated values, temporarily marking them as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate their ranks. The function returns the minimum rank found, plus 1, and updates the `rank` list with this value. The function does not modify the original dictionary (`d`) or the `processing` list.
