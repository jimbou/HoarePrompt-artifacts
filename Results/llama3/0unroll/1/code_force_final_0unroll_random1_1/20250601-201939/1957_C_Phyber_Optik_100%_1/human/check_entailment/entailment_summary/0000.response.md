Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the board such that no two rooks attack each other. The dynamic programming approach is correct, and the recurrence relation used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks is also correct.

The program also correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the user's move, and it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program is correct. It correctly populates the dp array with the number of ways to tile a 2xn rectangle with 2x1 tiles, which is equivalent to the number of ways to place rooks on the chessboard.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
