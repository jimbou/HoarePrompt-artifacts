This function calculates and populates an array dp with values representing the number of ways to tile a 2xn rectangle with 2x1 tiles, where n is a non-negative integer. The function takes no explicit parameters but uses the value of n to determine the size of the dp array. After execution, the dp array is populated with the number of ways to tile a 2xi rectangle for i ranging from 1 to n, with each value calculated using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the dp array in-place.
