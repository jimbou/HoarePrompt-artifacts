Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after k moves.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of different final configurations possible for an i x i chessboard. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

The program then calculates dp[i] for i from 3 to n using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for an i x i chessboard, we can either place a white rook in the first row (which gives dp[i - 1] possibilities), or we can place a white rook in the first column (which gives 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] possibilities, since we have i - 1 choices for the row and dp[i - 2] choices for the remaining (i - 2) x (i - 2) subboard).

The program then reads the input and calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions where a rook has already been placed) and prints the maximum of 1 and dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining valid positions.

Correctness: **True**
