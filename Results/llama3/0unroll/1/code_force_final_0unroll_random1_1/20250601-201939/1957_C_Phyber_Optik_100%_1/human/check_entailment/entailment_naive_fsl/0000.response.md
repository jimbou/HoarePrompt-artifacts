Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is correct, and the base cases are properly handled. The program also correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move.

The program uses a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the number of possible configurations for an i x i chessboard. The program initializes dp[1] and dp[2] correctly, and then uses a loop to calculate dp[i] for i from 3 to n. The recurrence relation used in the loop is correct, and the program correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played. It then reads the moves and calculates the number of possible final configurations using the dynamic programming array. The program correctly handles the case where the number of moves is 0, and it correctly prints the result modulo 10^9+7.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
