#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: Output State: dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, dp[4] is 17, dp[5] is 37, dp[6] is 77, dp[7] is 157, dp[8] is 317, dp[9] is 637, dp[10] is 1277, dp[11] is 2557, dp[12] is 5117, dp[13] is 10237, dp[14] is 20477, dp[15] is 40957, dp[16] is 81917, dp[17] is 163837, dp[18] is 327677, dp[19] is 655357, dp[20] is 1310717.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and populates an array dp with values representing the number of ways to tile a 2xn rectangle with 2x1 tiles, where n is a non-negative integer. The function takes no explicit parameters but uses the value of n to determine the size of the dp array. After execution, the dp array is populated with the number of ways to tile a 2xi rectangle for i ranging from 1 to n, with each value calculated using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the dp array in-place.
