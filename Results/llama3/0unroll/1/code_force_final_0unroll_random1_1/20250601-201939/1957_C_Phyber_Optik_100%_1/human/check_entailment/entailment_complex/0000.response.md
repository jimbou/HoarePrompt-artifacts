Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to tile a 2xn rectangle with 2x1 tiles, which is equivalent to the number of different final configurations possible in the game.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array dp with a size of 300007. It then calculates the values of dp[i] for i ranging from 1 to 300000 using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. This recurrence relation is correct because it takes into account the two possible moves for the current player (placing a white rook on the current row or column) and the two possible responses from the computer (placing a black rook on the mirrored position or skipping its turn).

After calculating the dp array, the program reads the input for each test case and calculates the number of invalid positions (rows and columns where a rook has already been placed). It then prints the maximum of 1 and dp[n - len(invalid)], which is the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

Correctness: **True**
