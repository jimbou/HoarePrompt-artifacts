Output State: **The value of t is 0, and the values of n, x, y, sx, l, and val are updated according to the last test case. The value of cons is printed for each test case.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of t has been decremented to 0. The values of n, x, y, sx, l, and val are updated according to the last test case processed by the loop. The value of cons is printed for each test case, representing the result of the calculation performed by the loop for that test case.
