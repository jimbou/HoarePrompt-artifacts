Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all integers in the list consecutive, considering the constraints x and y, and prints this value for each test case. The function iterates through all test cases and updates its internal state accordingly, ultimately printing the result for each case.**
