Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it implements the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score. The strategy is to always choose the two smallest numbers on the whiteboard, add the smaller one to the score, and erase both numbers. This ensures that the score is maximized.

The program correctly implements this strategy by first sorting the list of numbers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller number (which is the first number in each pair) to the score. This is done for each pair of numbers, which is equivalent to performing the move exactly n times.

The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves, and printing the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
