Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the list of integers in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of the two integers at each step to the score.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the smallest possible integer is added to the score at each step, thereby maximizing the final score. By sorting the list first, the program guarantees that the smallest integer is always chosen at each step, which is the key to achieving the maximum final score.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
