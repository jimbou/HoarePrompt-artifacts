Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of integers on the whiteboard (2n) and the integers themselves. It sorts the integers in ascending order and initializes the score to 0.

The program then iterates over the sorted integers in steps of 2, adding the smaller integer (l[i]) to the score. This is equivalent to choosing the two smallest integers from the whiteboard, adding the smaller one to the score, and erasing both integers.

The program repeats this process n times, which is the number of moves required. Finally, it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases or potential issues that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
