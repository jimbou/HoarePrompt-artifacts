Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and then reads `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), adding the smallest number in each pair to the `score`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it:

* Sorts the list of integers to ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together.
* Iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smallest number in each pair to the score. This ensures that the maximum final score is achieved by pairing the smallest numbers together.
* Prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program's output matches the expected output in the problem description, and it correctly handles the edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1 or when all numbers are the same).

Correctness: **True**
