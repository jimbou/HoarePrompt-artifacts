Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not attempt to solve the problem described. It appears to be a collection of unrelated functions for reading input and performing basic operations, but it does not address the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

A correct solution would involve sorting the array, then iterating through the sorted array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The program does not contain any logic to solve this problem.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 2, because by adding the permutation [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], we can make the array [3, 3, 4, 4, 5], where the number 3 and 4 both occur twice. However, the provided program does not attempt to solve this problem.
