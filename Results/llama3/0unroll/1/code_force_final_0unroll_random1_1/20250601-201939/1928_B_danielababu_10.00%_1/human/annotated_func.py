#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a non-negative integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a non-negative integer that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers provided in the standard input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the integers, effectively converting the input string into a sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were inputted through stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of space-separated values of any type and value.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input, splits it into individual values, converts each value to a string, and returns a map object containing these string values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings sorted in ascending order, where the strings are the input from stdin, split by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, splits them into individual strings, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list of cumulative products of elements in arr, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of cumulative products of elements in the list 'arr', where 'arr' is a list of non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of non-negative integers and returns the result as a new list. The input list remains unchanged. The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a list of the same length, where each element is the product of all elements up to that point in the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: The list ans contains the cumulative product of the elements in arr in reverse order, starting from the last element. The variable tem is equal to the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list that contains the cumulative product of the elements in arr in reverse order, starting from the last element.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a new list containing the cumulative product of the input elements in reverse order, starting from the last element. The function does not modify the original input list.
