Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a deque from the `collections` module, but it's not actually used in the code. Instead, the program uses a simple iterative approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `res` of length `n` to store the constructed permutation.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a_i` in `a`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
7. It updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
8. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `res`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `deque` module is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
