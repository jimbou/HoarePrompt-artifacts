Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2.  It initializes an array `res` of size `n` to store the result and a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum excluded value (MEX).
3.  The program iterates over the input list in reverse order. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the value of `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]` and stores it in `res[i]`.
4.  It updates the `mex` value if the newly calculated `p_i` is less than the current `mex`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` constructed so far.
5.  Finally, the program prints the resulting list `res`, which represents a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
