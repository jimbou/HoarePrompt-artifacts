Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum excluded value (mex) of the input list and updates it iteratively. For each element in the input list, it subtracts the element from the current mex and updates the mex if necessary. The function then prints the resulting list of integers in reverse order of the input list. The output list represents the difference between the mex and each corresponding element in the input list, with the mex updated at each step.**
