Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in the input list from the minimum excluded value (mex) of the input list. The mex value is updated in each iteration to be the minimum of the current mex and the difference between the current mex and the current element in the input list. The output list is in reverse order of the input list.**
