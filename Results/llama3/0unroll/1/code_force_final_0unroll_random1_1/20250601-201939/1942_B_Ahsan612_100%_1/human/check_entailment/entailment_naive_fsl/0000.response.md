Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It successfully constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

The program uses a deque to efficiently keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, which is the definition of the MEX. It iterates over the array from right to left, calculating the value of `p_i` as `mex - a_i` and updating the value of `mex` if necessary.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `a_i` is negative or equal to `n`. The use of a deque allows it to efficiently keep track of the MEX, making it scalable for large inputs.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
