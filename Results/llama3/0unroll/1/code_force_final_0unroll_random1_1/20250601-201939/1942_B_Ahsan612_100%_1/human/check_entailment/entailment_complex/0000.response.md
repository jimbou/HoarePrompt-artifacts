Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program iterates over the array a in reverse order, maintaining the minimum excluded value (mex) of the permutation p constructed so far. For each element a_i in the array a, it calculates the corresponding element p_i in the permutation p as mex - a_i. The mex value is updated to be the minimum of the current mex and the difference between the current mex and the current element a_i. This ensures that the constructed permutation p satisfies the given array a.

The program also handles the case where the input array a has negative elements correctly. The use of the deque data structure is not necessary in this case, as the program only needs to iterate over the array a in reverse order, which can be done using a simple loop.

The output of the program is also correct. It prints the constructed permutation p in the correct order, which is the reverse order of the input array a.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
