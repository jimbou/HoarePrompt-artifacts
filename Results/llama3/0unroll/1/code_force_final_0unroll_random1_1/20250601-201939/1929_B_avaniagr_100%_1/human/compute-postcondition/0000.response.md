Output State: **The output state contains t lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line is the result of the calculations performed on the corresponding input line. Specifically, for each input line with values n and k, the output line contains the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/2 if k is less than or equal to 4n-4, 2n-1 if k is equal to 4n-3, or 2n if k is equal to 4n-2.**
