Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks the value of k in relation to the total number of diagonals (4n - 2) and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored accordingly.

If k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, it prints the ceiling of k/2, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color k diagonals. If k is equal to 4n - 3, it prints 2n - 1, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color all diagonals except one. If k is equal to 4n - 2, it prints 2n, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color all diagonals.

The program correctly handles the different cases and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
