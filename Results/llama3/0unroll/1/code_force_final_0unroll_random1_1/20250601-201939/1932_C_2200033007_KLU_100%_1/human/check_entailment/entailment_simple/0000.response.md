Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the commands in the string `s` and calculates the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` when divided by `m` after each command.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
2. The function `func_1` is called with these variables as arguments.
3. Inside `func_1`, the program initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
4. The program then iterates over the string `s` from left to right. For each character `s[i]`, it checks if it is 'L' or 'R'. If it is 'L', it removes the leftmost element from `a` and appends it to `b`. If it is 'R', it removes the rightmost element from `a` and appends it to `b`.
5. After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders of the product of the elements in `a` when divided by `m` after each command.
6. The program then iterates over the list `b` in reverse order. For each element `v` in `b`, it calculates the product of `v` and the previous product `p` modulo `m`, and appends the result to `ans`.
7. Finally, the program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the remainders of the product of the elements in `a` when divided by `m` after each command.

The program's correctness can be verified by checking the output for the given example inputs. The output matches the expected output, which confirms that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
