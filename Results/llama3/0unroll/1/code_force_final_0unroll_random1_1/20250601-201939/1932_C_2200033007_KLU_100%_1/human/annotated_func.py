#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1

        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: The list ans contains the modular multiplicative inverse of each element in the list b, in reverse order, with respect to the modulus m. The variable p is the modular multiplicative inverse of the last element in the list b with respect to the modulus m. The variables l and r remain unchanged, with l still equal to n and r still equal to -1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list of modular multiplicative inverses of each element in list b, in reverse order, with respect to the modulus m. The list is the same as ans but in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes as input a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer 'm'. It rearranges the elements of 'a' based on the characters in 's', then calculates the modular multiplicative inverses of the rearranged elements with respect to 'm'. The function returns the list of these inverses in reverse order.
