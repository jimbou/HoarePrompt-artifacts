The function takes as input a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer 'm'. It rearranges the elements of 'a' based on the characters in 's', then calculates the modular multiplicative inverses of the rearranged elements with respect to 'm'. The function returns the list of these inverses in reverse order.
