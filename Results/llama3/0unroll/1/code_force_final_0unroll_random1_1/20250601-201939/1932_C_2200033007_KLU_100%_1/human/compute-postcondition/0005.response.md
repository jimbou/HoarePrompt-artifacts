Output State: The list ans contains the modular multiplicative inverse of each element in the list b, in reverse order, with respect to the modulus m. The variable p is the modular multiplicative inverse of the last element in the list b with respect to the modulus m. The variables l and r remain unchanged, with l still equal to n and r still equal to -1.
