Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the value to take the remainder by `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `s`.

2. The function `func_1(n, m, a, s)` is defined to process the commands in the string `s`. It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of the array `a` in the order they are removed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`, respectively.

3. The function then iterates over the string `s`. If the current command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to the list `b` and increments the pointer `l`. If the current command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to the list `b` and decrements the pointer `r`.

4. After processing all commands, the function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step, and a variable `p` to keep track of the product.

5. The function then iterates over the list `b` in reverse order. For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies the product `p` by `v` and takes the remainder by `m`, then appends the result to the list `ans`.

6. Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the remainders of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step.

7. The main program prints the result of `func_1(n, m, a, s)` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
