Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold m rounds. The program iterates over each test case, counts the frequency of each problem difficulty level, and then calculates the number of missing problems needed to make the frequency of each difficulty level equal to m. The program returns a list of results, one for each test case, which represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

Correctness: **True**
