Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of missing characters in each test case to make the frequency of each character equal to m. The list is stored in the variable 'results'. The variable 't' remains a positive integer, and 'test_cases' remains a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of two elements: a tuple of two positive integers 'n' and 'm', and a string 'a' of 'n' characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
