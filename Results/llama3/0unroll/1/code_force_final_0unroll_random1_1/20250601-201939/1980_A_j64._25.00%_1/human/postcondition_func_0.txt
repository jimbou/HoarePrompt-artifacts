This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes as input a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases, and a list 'test_cases' containing 't' test cases. Each test case is a tuple of three elements: two positive integers 'n' and 'm', and a string 'a' of 'n' characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of missing characters in each test case to make the frequency of each character equal to 'm'. The input variables 't' and 'test_cases' remain unchanged after the function execution.
