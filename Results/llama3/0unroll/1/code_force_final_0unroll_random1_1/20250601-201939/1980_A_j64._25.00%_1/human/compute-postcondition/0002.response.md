Output State: The variable results is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of missing characters in each test case to make the frequency of each character equal to m. The variable t is still a positive integer, and test_cases is still a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of two elements: a tuple of two positive integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
