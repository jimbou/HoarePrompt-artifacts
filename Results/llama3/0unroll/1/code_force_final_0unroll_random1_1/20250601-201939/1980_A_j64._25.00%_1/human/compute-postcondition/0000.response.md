Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of two elements: a tuple of two positive integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list**

The code defines a function to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create, but it does not execute this function. The function takes three arguments: t, test_cases, and results. The variable t remains unchanged as a positive integer. The variable test_cases also remains unchanged as a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing two positive integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. The variable results is initialized as an empty list.
