Output State: **The output state will be a series of strings, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', one for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state will be a list of winners for each test case. If the difference between any two consecutive numbers in the sorted array (in descending order) is greater than 1, or if the previous difference was already greater than 1, the winner will be 'Alice'. Otherwise, the winner will be 'Bob'. The number of winners will be equal to the initial value of `tc`.
