Determines the winner of a game for each test case by analyzing a sorted list of unique integers. The function takes no arguments and returns a series of strings, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', indicating the winner of each test case. The output is based on the difference between consecutive integers in the sorted list, with 'Alice' winning if the difference is greater than 1 at any point, and 'Bob' winning otherwise.
