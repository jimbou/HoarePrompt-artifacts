Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program checks for the possibility of Alice winning. The program checks if there is a difference of more than 1 between any two consecutive pile sizes, and if so, it concludes that Alice can win. However, this is not a sufficient condition for Alice to win.

A counterexample is when the input is [2, 2, 2, 2]. In this case, the program will conclude that Alice can win because there is no difference of more than 1 between any two consecutive pile sizes. However, in reality, Bob can win by choosing k=2 on his first turn, which will empty all the piles at once.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the XOR operation. The winner of the game is the player who can make the XOR of all pile sizes equal to 0. This is because the XOR operation has the property that a ^ a = 0, so if the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, it means that all piles can be emptied simultaneously.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        xor = 0
        for num in arr:
            xor ^= num
        print('Alice' if xor != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```
This program correctly determines the winner of the game by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is not equal to 0, it means that Alice can win; otherwise, Bob can win.
