Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, and the integers are positive and do not exceed 10^9.**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and n space-separated integers. The values of n and the integers are still positive and do not exceed 10^9.
