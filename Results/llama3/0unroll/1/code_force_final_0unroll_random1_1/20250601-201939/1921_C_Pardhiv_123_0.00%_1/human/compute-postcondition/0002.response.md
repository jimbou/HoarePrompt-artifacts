Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. For each test case, it calculates the remaining fuel f after traveling through the distances between consecutive integers in the second line, with the fuel consumption being the minimum of a times the distance and b. If the remaining fuel f is positive, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates.**
