Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.
