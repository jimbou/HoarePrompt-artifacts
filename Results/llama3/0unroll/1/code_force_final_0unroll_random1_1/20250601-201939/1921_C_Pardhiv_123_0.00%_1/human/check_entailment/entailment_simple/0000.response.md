Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially `b`.
3. It then reads the moments at which messages need to be sent `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
4. The program calculates the remaining charge `f` after sending each message by subtracting the minimum of the charge consumption per unit of time multiplied by the time difference between the current and previous message (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) and the charge consumption when turned off and on sequentially (`b`). This is because Stepan can either keep the phone on and consume charge at a rate of `a` per unit of time or turn it off and on, consuming `b` units of charge.
5. If the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0 after sending all messages, the program prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
