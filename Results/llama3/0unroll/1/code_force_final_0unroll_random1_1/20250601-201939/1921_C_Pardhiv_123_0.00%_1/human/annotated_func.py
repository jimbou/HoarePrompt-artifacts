#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t = 0, f = 0, a = 0, b = 0, ls = [], n = 0, m_1 = 0, m_2 = 0, ..., m_n = 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. For each test case, it calculates the remaining fuel f after traveling through the distances between consecutive integers in the second line, with the fuel consumption being the minimum of a times the distance and b. If the remaining fuel f is positive, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates.
