Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of messages (n), the initial phone charge (f), the charge consumption per unit of time (a), and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially (b). It also reads the moments at which messages need to be sent (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n).

2. The program correctly calculates the remaining phone charge (f) after sending all messages. It iterates through the moments at which messages need to be sent and subtracts the minimum of the charge consumption per unit of time (a) times the distance between consecutive moments and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially (b) from the remaining charge (f).

3. The program correctly determines whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. If the remaining charge (f) is positive after sending all messages, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. The program correctly repeats the process for all test cases.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
