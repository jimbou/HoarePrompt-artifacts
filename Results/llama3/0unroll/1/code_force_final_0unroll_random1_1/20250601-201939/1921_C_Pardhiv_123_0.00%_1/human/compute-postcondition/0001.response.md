Output State: **t = 0, f = 0, a = 0, b = 0, ls = [], n = 0, m_1 = 0, m_2 = 0, ..., m_n = 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `f`, `a`, and `b` are also reset to 0, as they are reinitialized with new values at the beginning of each test case. The list `ls` is empty, as it is reinitialized with new values at the beginning of each test case. The variables `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are also reset to 0, as they are reinitialized with new values at the beginning of each test case.
