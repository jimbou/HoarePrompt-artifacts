Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly parses the input into the number of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c).
3. The program then adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts, effectively distributing the universals among the extroverts. This is a valid approach because universals can live with any number of people.
4. The program then calculates the minimum number of tents needed by taking the maximum of the number of introverts and the integer division of the total number of extroverts by 3 (i.e., the number of full tents needed for the extroverts). If the number of universals is less than the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, so the program outputs -1.
5. The program uses the ternary operator to concisely express the logic for outputting either the minimum number of tents or -1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic for solving the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
