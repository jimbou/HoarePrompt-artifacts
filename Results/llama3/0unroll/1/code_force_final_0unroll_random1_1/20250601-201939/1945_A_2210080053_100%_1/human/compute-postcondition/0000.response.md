If the number of universals is less than the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3, the output will be -1. Otherwise, the number of introverts will be increased by the integer division of the total number of extroverts by 3, and the number of extroverts will be the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3.**
