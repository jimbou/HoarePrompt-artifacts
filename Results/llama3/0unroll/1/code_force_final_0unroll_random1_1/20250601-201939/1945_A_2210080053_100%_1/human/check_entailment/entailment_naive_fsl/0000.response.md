Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first reads the number of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c) from the input.

2. It then adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This is because universals can be treated as extroverts when it comes to tent allocation.

3. The program then calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals. This is done by dividing the total number of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. This gives the number of tents that can be fully occupied by extroverts and universals.

4. The program then checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spaces in the tents. If there are not enough universals, it means that some extroverts will be left without a tent, and the program outputs -1.

5. If there are enough universals, the program adds the number of introverts to the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals. This gives the total number of tents needed.

6. Finally, the program outputs the total number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spaces in the tents, and the case where there are no extroverts or universals. Therefore, the program is correct.
