Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with arrows pointing left or right. The program checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1).

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` as input, representing the arrows in the grid. It checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by iterating through the columns and checking the arrows.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1.  If there is a column where the robot cannot move right because the arrow in the current cell points left and the arrows in the adjacent cells also point left, the program returns 'No'.
2.  If the robot reaches the last column and the arrow in the top cell points left and the arrow in the bottom cell also points left, the program returns 'No'.
3.  If none of the above conditions are met, the program returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

`func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
