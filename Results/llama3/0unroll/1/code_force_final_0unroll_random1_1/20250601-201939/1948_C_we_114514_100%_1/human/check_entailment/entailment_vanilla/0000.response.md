Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n`, the first row `row1`, and the second row `row2` as input and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:

1.  It calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`, which is the number of pairs of columns.
2.  It iterates over the pairs of columns (excluding the last pair) and checks if the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'`) and if the arrow in the second row points to the left in either the current column or the next column (`row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'`). If this condition is met, it returns 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
3.  It checks the last pair of columns and returns 'No' if the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[n - 1] == '<'`) and the arrow in the second row points to the left in the second last column (`row2[n - 2] == '<'`).
4.  If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The logic in `func_1` is correct. It properly checks the conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n) and returns 'No' in those cases. If none of those conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

`func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. It does not contain any logical errors.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
