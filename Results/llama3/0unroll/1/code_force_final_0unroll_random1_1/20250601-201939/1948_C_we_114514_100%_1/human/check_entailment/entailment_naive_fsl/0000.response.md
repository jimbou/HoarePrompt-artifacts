Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The function `func_1` checks the conditions for the robot to reach the target cell by iterating through the grid and checking the arrow directions. It correctly handles the cases where the robot can move left, right, up, or down and then follows the arrow direction. The function returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the target cell and 'No' otherwise.

The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the given grid and arrow directions. It correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible scenarios, including the cases where the robot can reach the target cell and where it cannot. Therefore, the program is correct.
