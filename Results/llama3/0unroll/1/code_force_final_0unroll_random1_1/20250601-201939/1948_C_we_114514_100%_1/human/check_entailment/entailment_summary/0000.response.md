Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns. The robot starts at position (1,1) and needs to reach position (2,n). The grid contains arrows pointing either left or right, and the robot moves according to these arrows.

Function `func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid. It checks if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) by analyzing the arrows in the grid. The function returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the target position and 'No' otherwise.

Function `func_2` reads the input for a specified number of test cases, processes each case by calling `func_1` with the provided input values, and stores the results in a list. The function then prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, one per line.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly determines whether the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) given the arrows in the grid. `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

However, there is a logical error in `func_1`. The function only checks if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) by analyzing the arrows in the grid, but it does not consider the case where the robot can move up or down. According to the problem description, the robot can move left, right, down, or up, but `func_1` only considers left and right movements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
