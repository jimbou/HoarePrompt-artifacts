Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns, following certain rules based on the direction of arrows in each cell. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes the number of columns (n) and two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows (row1 and row2) as input. It checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by analyzing the directions of the arrows in the grid. The function iterates over the columns in steps of 2, checking if the robot can move to the right or down without going outside the grid. If it finds a situation where the robot cannot move further, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

func_2 reads the input for a specified number of test cases, processes each case by calling func_1 with the provided input values, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results of func_1 for each test case, one per line.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) given the grid and the rules of movement.

Correctness: **True**
