The code prints a string indicating the final score of the game, where the score of the first team is represented by `points[0]` and the score of the second team is represented by `points[1]`. 

Output: **The state of the game after t iterations, where t is the number of commands read from the input. The state includes the updated positions of the players and the ball, the points scored by each team, and the status of each player (active or eliminated). The game state is represented by the variables: elements (a dictionary mapping player and ball names to their positions), allPlayers (a dictionary mapping player names to their status), points (a list of two integers representing the points scored by each team), and GoalName (a list of two strings representing the names of the goals)., and this is printed: "FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]]"**
