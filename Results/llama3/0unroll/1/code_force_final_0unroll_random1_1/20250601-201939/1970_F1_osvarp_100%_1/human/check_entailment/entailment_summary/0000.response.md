Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, processing a series of commands to update the game state, including player positions, ball position, points scored, and player status (active or eliminated). The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `goalIn`, and `isPlayer`.

`func_1` is the main function that simulates the game. It reads the input, initializes the game state, and processes the commands. It uses the `goalIn` function to determine the team affiliation of a given position on the field and the `isPlayer` function to check if a given element is a player.

The `goalIn` function determines the team affiliation of a given position on the field by checking if the position is in the list of goals for either team.

The `isPlayer` function checks if a given element is a player by verifying that the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

The program correctly implements the game logic, including player movement, ball movement, scoring, and player elimination. It also correctly handles the game state, including the positions of players, the ball, and goals, as well as the points scored by each team.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
