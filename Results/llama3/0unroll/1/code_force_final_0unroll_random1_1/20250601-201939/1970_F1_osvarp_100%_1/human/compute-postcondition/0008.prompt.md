You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

    #State: The state of the game after t iterations, where t is the number of commands read from the input. The state includes the updated positions of the players and the ball, the points scored by each team, and the status of each player (active or eliminated). The game state is represented by the variables: elements (a dictionary mapping player and ball names to their positions), allPlayers (a dictionary mapping player names to their status), points (a list of two integers representing the points scored by each team), and GoalName (a list of two strings representing the names of the goals).
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
