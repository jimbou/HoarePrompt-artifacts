Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the state of the variables has changed as follows:

*   `comand` is an empty list because `stdin` is empty.
*   `obj`, `com`, and `el` are empty strings because `comand` is empty.
*   `points` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the total points scored by team 0, and the second integer is the total points scored by team 1. The points are calculated based on the number of goals scored by each team and the number of times the Golden Snitch was caught.
*   `allPlayers` is a dictionary where the values of the players who were eliminated or caught the Golden Snitch are set to `False`, and the values of the players who were not eliminated or caught the Golden Snitch are set to `True`.
*   `elements` is a dictionary where the positions of the players and the Golden Snitch are updated based on the movements specified in the `comand` list.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
