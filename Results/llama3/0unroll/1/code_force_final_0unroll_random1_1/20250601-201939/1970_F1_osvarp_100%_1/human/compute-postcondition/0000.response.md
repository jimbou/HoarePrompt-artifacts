Output State: **`el` is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.' and the second character is either a digit from 0 to 9, 'G', or 'Q'. `res` is `True` if the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise `res` is `False`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` remains the same as in the initial state, but a new variable `res` is introduced. The value of `res` depends on the first and second characters of `el`. If the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', then `res` is `True`. Otherwise, `res` is `False`.
