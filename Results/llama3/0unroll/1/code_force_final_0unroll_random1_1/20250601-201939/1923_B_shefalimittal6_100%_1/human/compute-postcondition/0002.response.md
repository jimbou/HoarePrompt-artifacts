Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` of length `n`. It then prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` remains unchanged.**
