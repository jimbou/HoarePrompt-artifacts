Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, depending on the result of the function func_1(a, x, k) for each iteration. The values of the variables n, k, a, and x are updated for each iteration based on the input provided, but their initial values are not retained. The variable t is decremented by 1 for each iteration, and its final value is 0. The initial state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
