    #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution, while maintaining the current state of variables: distance as the number of iterations of the outer while loop, pos as the number of elements in sorted_indices that have been processed, and a containing the remaining values after the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to reduce a list of non-negative integers (a) to zero by iteratively subtracting values from a list of non-zero integers (x), subject to a constraint (k). The function returns True if successful and False otherwise, modifying the list (a) in the process.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` of length `n`. It then prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether it is possible to make all elements of list `a` equal by adding or subtracting elements from list `x` without exceeding the limit `k`.
