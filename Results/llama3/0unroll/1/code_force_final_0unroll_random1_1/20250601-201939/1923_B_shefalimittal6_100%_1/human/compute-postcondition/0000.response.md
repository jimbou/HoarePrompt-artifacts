Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a list of non-zero integers, `k` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer, and `len(a) = len(x) = n`, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, which is now empty. The length of `a` and `x` is still `n`.
