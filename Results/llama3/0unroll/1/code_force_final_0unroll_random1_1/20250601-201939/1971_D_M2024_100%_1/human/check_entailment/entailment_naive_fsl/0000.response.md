Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. It iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means the string is already sorted, so it prints cut1 + 1. Otherwise, it prints cut0 + cut1.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if the input string is "11010", the program correctly outputs 3, because the string can be cut into three pieces "11", "0", and "10" which can be rearranged into a sorted binary string "0011". Similarly, if the input string is "00000000", the program correctly outputs 1, because the string is already sorted. 

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the input string is "1", the program correctly outputs 1, because the string is already sorted. If the input string is "10", the program correctly outputs 2, because the string can be cut into two pieces "1" and "0" which can be rearranged into a sorted binary string "01". 

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases correctly.
