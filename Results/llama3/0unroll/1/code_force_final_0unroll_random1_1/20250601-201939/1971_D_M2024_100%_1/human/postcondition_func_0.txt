This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters. For each string, it calculates the minimum number of cuts (character changes) required to make all characters the same, either all '0's or all '1's. The function then prints the total number of cuts required for each string, considering transitions from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1', and adding 1 if the string starts with '1' and has no '0' to '1' transitions. The output consists of t lines, each containing a single integer representing the total number of cuts required for the corresponding input string.
