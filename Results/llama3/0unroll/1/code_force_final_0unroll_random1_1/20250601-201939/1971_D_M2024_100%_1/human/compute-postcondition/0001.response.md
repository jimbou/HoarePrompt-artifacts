Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line will be the total number of cuts required to make all the characters in the corresponding input string the same, either all '0's or all '1's. The cuts are made by changing a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. The number of cuts is calculated by counting the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1' in the string, and adding 1 if the string starts with a '1' and there are no transitions from '0' to '1'.**
