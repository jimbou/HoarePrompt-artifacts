Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program will output 0, but the correct answer should be n - 2, because all vertices are already chosen and no more vertices can be added.

For example, if the input is:

3
4 4 0
1 2 3 4

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 2.

The issue is in the line `ans = x + y - 2`, which assumes that x is always less than n. However, when x is equal to n, this formula is incorrect.
