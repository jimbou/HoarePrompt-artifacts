Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers in the range [1, n] appear exactly once, given the initial set of numbers and the number of additional numbers that can be added. The list contains tt integers, where tt is the number of test cases.
