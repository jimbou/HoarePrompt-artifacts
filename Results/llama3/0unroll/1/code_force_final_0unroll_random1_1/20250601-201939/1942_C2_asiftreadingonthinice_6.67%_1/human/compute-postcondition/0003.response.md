Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the minimum number of integers that can be added to the list to make it a contiguous sequence of integers from 1 to n, considering the constraints x, y, and the given list. The function then prints the minimum of the calculated answer and n-2 for each test case.**
