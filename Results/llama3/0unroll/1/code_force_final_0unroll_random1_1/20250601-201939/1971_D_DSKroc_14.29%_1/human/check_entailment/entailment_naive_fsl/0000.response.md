Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program works by iterating through the binary string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because in a sorted binary string, all '0's come before all '1's. Therefore, each time a '1' is followed by a '0', it means that the string is not sorted and a cut is needed to rearrange it. The program then adds 1 to the count because the remaining part of the string (after the last cut) is also a piece. This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the string is already sorted or has only one character.
