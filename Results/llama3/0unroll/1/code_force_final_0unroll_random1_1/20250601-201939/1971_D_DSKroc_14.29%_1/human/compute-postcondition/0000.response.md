The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**
