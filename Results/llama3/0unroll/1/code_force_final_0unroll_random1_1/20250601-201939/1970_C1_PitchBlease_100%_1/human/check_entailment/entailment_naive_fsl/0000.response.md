Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the tree has more than two leaves. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the tree has exactly two leaves, but the program does not handle the case where the tree has more than two leaves. 

In the function `func_1`, the program assumes that there are only two leaves and uses the list `leaves` to store them. However, if the tree has more than two leaves, the list `leaves` will contain more than two elements, and the program will not work correctly.

For example, if the input is:

```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
5
```

The program will not work correctly because the tree has three leaves (5, 6, and 4), but the program assumes that there are only two leaves.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the tree has more than two leaves.
