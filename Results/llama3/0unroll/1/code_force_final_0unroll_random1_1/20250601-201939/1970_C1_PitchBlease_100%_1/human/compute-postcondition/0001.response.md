Output State: **The output state is the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree.**

In this output state, the loop has iterated through all the nodes in the tree, starting from the start node, and has found the shortest path to the target node. The distance is calculated by incrementing the distance by 1 for each neighbor visited. The loop continues until it finds the target node or until the queue is empty, indicating that there is no path from the start node to the target node.
