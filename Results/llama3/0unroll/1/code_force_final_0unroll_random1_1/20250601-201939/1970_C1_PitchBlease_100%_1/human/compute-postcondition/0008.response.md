Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the distance from a start node to the two leaves of a tree graph.**

The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `edges` (a list of pairs of integers representing edges in the tree), and `start` (an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive). It constructs a tree graph from the edges and identifies the two leaves. Then, it calculates the distance from the start node to each leaf using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. If either distance is odd, the function returns the string 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'.
