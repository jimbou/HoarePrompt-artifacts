Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, start and target are keys in the tree dictionary, queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start**.

The code initializes a queue with a tuple containing the start node and the value 0, and a set visited with the start node. The start and target nodes, as well as the tree dictionary, remain unchanged. The queue and visited set are new variables introduced by the code, with their initial values as described.
