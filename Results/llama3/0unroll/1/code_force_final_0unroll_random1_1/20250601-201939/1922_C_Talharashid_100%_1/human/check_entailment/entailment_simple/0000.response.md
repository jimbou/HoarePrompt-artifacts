Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

The program first initializes two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city and from each city to the last city, respectively.

The program then iterates over the list of cities, calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city and storing it in `d1`. It does this by checking if the distance between the current city and the next city is less than the distance between the current city and the previous city. If it is, it adds 1 to the minimum number of coins needed to travel to the current city. Otherwise, it adds the distance between the current city and the next city to the minimum number of coins needed to travel to the current city.

The program then iterates over the list of cities in reverse order, calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel from each city to the last city and storing it in `d2`. It does this in a similar way to how it calculated `d1`.

Finally, the program reads in the queries and prints the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to the second city in each query. It does this by subtracting the minimum number of coins needed to travel to the first city from the minimum number of coins needed to travel to the second city.

Correctness: **True**
