Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n, followed by n space-separated integers, then an integer m, and finally m lines of two space-separated integers. It calculates and prints the differences in values between two dictionaries, d1 and d2, at specific indices for each query (x, y), where x and y are the two integers in each query. The function processes all test cases and queries, printing the results for each query.**
