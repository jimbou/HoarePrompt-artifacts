Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem, which involves finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meet certain conditions. The program consists of multiple functions, each with its own specific task.

Function 14 is the core function that generates the sequence of integers based on the input values n and k. It correctly handles the cases where k is 1 and n is not equal to 2, and generates the sequence of powers of 2 and additional values as required.

Function 15 is the main function that reads the number of test cases from the input, calls Function 14 for each test case, and writes the output to the standard output.

The program correctly implements the required logic and does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
