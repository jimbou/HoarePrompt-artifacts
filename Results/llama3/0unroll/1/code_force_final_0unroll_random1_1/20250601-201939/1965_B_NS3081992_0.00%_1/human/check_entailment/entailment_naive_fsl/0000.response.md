Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when n is 1 and k is 1. In this case, the program should return an empty sequence, but it does not. The program only handles the case when k is 1 and n is greater than 1, or when k is greater than 1. It does not consider the case when both n and k are 1. 

For example, if the input is 1 1, the program should return an empty sequence, but it does not. This is because the program does not check for this specific case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases.
