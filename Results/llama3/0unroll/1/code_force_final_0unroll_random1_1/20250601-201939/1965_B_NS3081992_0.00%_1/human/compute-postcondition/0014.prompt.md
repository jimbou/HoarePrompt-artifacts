You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns a string '1\n2' where '1' is a string and '\n' is a newline character and '2' is a string.
        #State: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is currently equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: The list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), where lk is the number of bits in the binary representation of k. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: The list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
    #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, the function returns the current state. Otherwise, the list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string of space-separated integers, including the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), the value k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged. The length of the binary string b is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. The integers n and k are such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is currently equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2

Case_2: The program returns a string of space-separated integers, including the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), the value k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged. The length of the binary string b is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. The integers n and k are such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
