This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns a tuple containing three values: the GCD of `a` and `b`, the coefficient of `a` in the Bézout's identity, and the coefficient of `b` in the Bézout's identity. If `b` is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and `a`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are 1 and 0, respectively. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns the calculated coefficients and the GCD.
