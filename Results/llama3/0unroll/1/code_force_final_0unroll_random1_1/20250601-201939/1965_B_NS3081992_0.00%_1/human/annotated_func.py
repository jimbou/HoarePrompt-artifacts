#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_3()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows_number', which is a positive integer, and returns a list of that length. The function does not modify any external state or perform any actions other than generating and returning the list.

    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all iterations of the loop plus 1, which is also equal to `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the list associated with key `da`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus 1 and returns this value.

    #The program returns three values: `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. `y` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` and `y` from `x`, where `x` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, `a` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `b`, and `y` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, and `g` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns a tuple containing three values: the GCD of `a` and `b`, the coefficient of `a` in the Bézout's identity, and the coefficient of `b` in the Bézout's identity. If `b` is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and `a`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are 1 and 0, respectively. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns the calculated coefficients and the GCD.
