Output State: **The program returns a string of space-separated integers, including the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), the value k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged. The length of the binary string b is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. The integers n and k are such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6.**
