Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer representing a key in d, and rank is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d.

The length of the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` is more than 1.

    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all iterations of the loop plus 1, which is also equal to `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the list associated with key `da`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus 1 and returns this value.

    #The program returns three values: `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. `y` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` and `y` from `x`, where `x` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, `a` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `b`, and `y` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`, and `g` is a returned value from `func_13(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns a tuple containing three values: the GCD of `a` and `b`, the coefficient of `a` in the Bézout's identity, and the coefficient of `b` in the Bézout's identity. If `b` is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and `a`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are 1 and 0, respectively. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns the calculated coefficients and the GCD.

The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged. The length of the binary string b is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. The integers n and k are such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a string of space-separated integers based on the input integers n and k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'.
