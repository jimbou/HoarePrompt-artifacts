This function generates a string of space-separated integers based on the input integers n and k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates a list of integers including powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of bits in the binary representation of n, as well as the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1, and returns them as a string of space-separated integers. The function does not modify the input integers n and k.
