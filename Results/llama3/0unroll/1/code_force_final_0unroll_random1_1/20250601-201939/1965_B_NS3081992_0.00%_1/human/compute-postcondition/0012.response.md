Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, the function returns the current state. Otherwise, the list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.***
