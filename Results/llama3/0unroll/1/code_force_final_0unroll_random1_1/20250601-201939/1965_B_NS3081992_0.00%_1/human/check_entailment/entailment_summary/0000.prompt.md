Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_3()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows_number', which is a positive integer, and returns a list of that length. The function does not modify any external state or perform any actions other than generating and returning the list.

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads the next line from the standard input file, removes any trailing newline characters, decodes the line using the default encoding, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two parts at the space character, converts each part to an integer, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :

def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(), and returns this list. The length of the returned list is equal to the input parameter 'rows', which is a non-negative integer.
Function number 9 :

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations, effectively acting as a pass-through function for the input integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input, splits it into individual values, and returns them as a list of strings.
Function number 12 :

def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the list associated with key `da`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus 1 and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1

''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns a tuple containing three values: the GCD of `a` and `b`, the coefficient of `a` in the Bézout's identity, and the coefficient of `b` in the Bézout's identity. If `b` is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and `a`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are 1 and 0, respectively. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function `func_13` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and returns the calculated coefficients and the GCD.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()

    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a string of space-separated integers based on the input integers n and k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates a list of integers including powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of bits in the binary representation of n, as well as the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1, and returns them as a string of space-separated integers. The function does not modify the input integers n and k.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function writes a sequence of strings to the standard output, where the number of strings is determined by the return value of func_10() and each string is the return value of func_14().
