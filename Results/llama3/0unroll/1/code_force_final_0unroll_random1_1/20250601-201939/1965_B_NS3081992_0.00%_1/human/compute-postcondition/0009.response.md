Output State: **The list ans contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), and the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the list ans has been extended to include three additional elements: k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The list ans now contains a mix of powers of 2 and other values calculated based on k and the sum of the original powers of 2 in ans.
