Output State: **A is False, not_c is True, arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, and the current value of not_c is True.**

In this output state, the value of A has been changed to False because the code `A = not A` negates the original value of A, which was True. The other variables, not_c, arr, and set_, remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The current value of not_c is still True, as it was in the initial state.
