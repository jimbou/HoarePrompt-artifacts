Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, not_c is True**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes and modifies the initial state. The list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing positive integers with the first element being 1. The variable `A` remains `False`. A new variable `set_` is created, which is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the original list `arr`. The variable `not_c` is assigned the value `True`.
