Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` only checks if the smallest pile has a size of 1 and if the sizes of the piles are consecutive. However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is the input `[2, 2, 3]`. The program will output "Bob", but the correct output is "Alice". Alice can win by choosing k=2 on her first turn, which will leave Bob with a pile of size 1. Then, Bob will have to choose k=1, and Alice can win by choosing k=1 again.

The correct solution involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sizes of the piles. If the GCD is 1, then Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn. Otherwise, Bob can win by choosing k equal to the GCD.
