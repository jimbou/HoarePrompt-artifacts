#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is `False`, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: A is True, not_c is True, arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *A is False if not_c is True, otherwise A remains True. not_c remains True, arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, and set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Since A is False if not_c is True, and not_c remains True, A is False. Therefore, the program returns 'Bob'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of positive integers meets certain conditions and returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on those conditions. The function first checks if the first element of the list is 1. If not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. If the first element is 1, it then checks if the list contains consecutive integers (after removing duplicates and sorting). If the list does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Bob'. If the list does contain consecutive integers, the function toggles a flag (A) and returns 'Alice' if A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
