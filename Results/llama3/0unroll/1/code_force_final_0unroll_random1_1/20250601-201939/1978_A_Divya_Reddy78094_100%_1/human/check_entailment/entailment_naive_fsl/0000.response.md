Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum number of pages is not in the last book. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2 3

The program will output 5 (2 + 3), but the correct output should be 4 (2 + 2) because Alice can put the book with 2 pages in one pile and the book with 2 pages in the other pile, and then read the book with 2 pages from each pile.

The program assumes that the maximum number of pages is always in the last book, which is not necessarily true. It should find the maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books and add it to the maximum number of pages in the last book.
