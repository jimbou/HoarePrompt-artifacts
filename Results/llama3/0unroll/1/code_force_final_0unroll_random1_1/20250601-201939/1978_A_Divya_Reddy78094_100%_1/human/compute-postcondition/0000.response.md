Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases, we can conclude that the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

The value of `t` is now assigned to the variable `t`, and the stdin now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

Note that the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 500, and the stdin contains `t` test cases, which is a specific number of test cases.
