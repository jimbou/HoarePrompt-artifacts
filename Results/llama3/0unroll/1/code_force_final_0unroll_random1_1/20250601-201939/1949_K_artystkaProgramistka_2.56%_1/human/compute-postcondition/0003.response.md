Postcondition: ***n remains a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers remains a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order but is potentially iterated over, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists containing distributed numbers from the numbers list, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are the sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c, respectively. The current value of sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c satisfies the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c).***
