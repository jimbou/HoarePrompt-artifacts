The code prints a string containing all the elements of the results list, separated by newline characters. The results list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query. Since the exact queries are not provided, we can't determine the exact 'YES' or 'NO' values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of all queries.

Output: **A string containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, separated by newline characters (where 'YES' or 'NO' are the results of the queries)**
