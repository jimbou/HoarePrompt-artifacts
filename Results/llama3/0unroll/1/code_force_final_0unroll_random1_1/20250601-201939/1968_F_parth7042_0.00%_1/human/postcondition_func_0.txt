This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers and a set of queries. It processes each query by checking if there exists a subarray within the given range that has a XOR value equal to the XOR value of the entire range. If such a subarray exists, it outputs 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The function outputs the results of all queries, separated by newline characters, and leaves the standard input empty.
