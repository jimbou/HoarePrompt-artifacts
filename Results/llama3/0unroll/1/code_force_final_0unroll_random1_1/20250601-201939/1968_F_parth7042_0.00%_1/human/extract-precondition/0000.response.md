Precondition: **stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains three lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and q, the second line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n, and the next q lines each contain two integers l and r. The input values are non-negative integers, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= a_i < 2^30, 1 <= l < r <= n.**
