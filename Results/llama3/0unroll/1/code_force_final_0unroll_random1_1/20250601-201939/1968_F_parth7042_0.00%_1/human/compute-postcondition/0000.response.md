Output State: **stdin contains a series of test cases with one less line of input, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, idx is 1**

Explanation: The first line reads the first line of input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, storing it in the variable `data`. The second line initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The third line converts the first element of the `data` list to an integer and stores it in the variable `t`. The fourth line increments the value of `idx` by 1. The fifth line initializes an empty list called `results`. 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer. The value of `idx` is now 1. The `results` list is still empty. Stdin now contains one less line of input, as the first line has been read and processed.
