Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of unique characters in alphabetical order.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process. The function is designed to encode a string, not decode it. It replaces each character in the input string with the last character in the list of unique characters, which is the opposite of what is needed for decoding.

Furthermore, the function modifies the input string `s` in place, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The function also returns a string of unique characters in ascending order, which is not the desired output.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should take the encoded string as input and return the original string. It should use the same algorithm as the encoding process, but in reverse. Specifically, it should replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the string of unique characters in alphabetical order.

Correctness: **False**
