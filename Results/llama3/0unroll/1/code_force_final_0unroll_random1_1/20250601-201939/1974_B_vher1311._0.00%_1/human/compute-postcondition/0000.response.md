Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars**

Explanation: The first line creates a set of unique characters from the string s, converts it to a list, and sorts it in ascending order. This list is assigned to the variable unique_chars. The second line initializes two variables, i and j, to the first and last indices of the unique_chars list, respectively. The value of s remains unchanged throughout the code execution.
