#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: Output State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is replaced by the last character in unique_chars, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s in ascending order, i is the length of unique_chars, j is -1.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string that consists of all unique characters in string 's', in ascending order, without any duplicates, and all characters are lowercase Latin letters.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string consisting of all unique characters in the input string, in ascending order, without any duplicates. The function replaces each character in the input string with the last character in the list of unique characters, and updates the list of unique characters by inserting non-unique characters and removing duplicates. The final state of the program is a string of unique characters in ascending order, without any duplicates, and all characters are lowercase Latin letters.
