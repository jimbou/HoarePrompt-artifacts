Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(b)` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function is not correctly implemented.

The function first creates a list of unique characters in the encoded string `b` in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the encoded string `b` and replaces each character with the last character in the list of unique characters. This is not the correct decoding process.

The correct decoding process would be to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with the corresponding character in the list of unique characters, but in reverse order. For example, the first character in the encoded string `b` should be replaced with the last character in the list of unique characters, the second character in the encoded string `b` should be replaced with the second last character in the list of unique characters, and so on.

However, the function does not do this. Instead, it replaces each character in the encoded string `b` with the last character in the list of unique characters, which is not correct.

Additionally, the function returns the list of unique characters in the encoded string `b`, which is not the decoded string.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
