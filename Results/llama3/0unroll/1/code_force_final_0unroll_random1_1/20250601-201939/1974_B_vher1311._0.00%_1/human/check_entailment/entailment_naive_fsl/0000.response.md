Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, specifically in the way it replaces characters in the string `s`. The function uses the `replace` method, which replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, not just the first one. This can lead to incorrect results when there are multiple occurrences of the same character in the string.

For example, if the input string is "aab", the function will replace all occurrences of "a" with the last character in the `unique_chars` list, resulting in the string "bb", which is not the correct decoding of the original string.

To fix this issue, the function should replace each character in the string `s` with the corresponding character from the `unique_chars` list only once, without affecting the other occurrences of the same character. This can be achieved by using a different approach, such as iterating over the characters in the string `s` and replacing each character with the corresponding character from the `unique_chars` list in a single pass.
