Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the occurrences of each number in the input array. The function `func_1` then iterates through the numbers starting from 0, decrementing the count of each number and its next consecutive number if present. If a number has no next consecutive number, it prints the current number plus one and returns.

This approach is correct because it simulates the game between Alice and Bob. Alice tries to maximize the score by picking the smallest available number, while Bob tries to minimize the score by picking the next consecutive number. By decrementing the count of each number and its next consecutive number, the program effectively simulates the game and finds the maximum possible score.

The use of a Counter object and the iterative approach make the program efficient and easy to understand. The program also handles the case where the input array is empty or contains only one element.

Correctness: **True**
