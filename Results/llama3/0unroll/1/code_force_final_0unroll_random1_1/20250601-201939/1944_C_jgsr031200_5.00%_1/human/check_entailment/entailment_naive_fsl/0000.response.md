Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to find the final score of the game between Alice and Bob, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, where n is the size of the array. For each number, it checks if it is present in the counter. If it is, it decrements the count and moves to the next number. If it is not, it prints the current number as the final score and returns.

The program correctly implements the game's rules and the definition of MEX. It correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers and the case where the array does not contain all numbers from 0 to n.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, in which case the final score is 0.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, because it iterates through the array once to count the occurrences of each number and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the final score.

The program's space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, because it uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.
