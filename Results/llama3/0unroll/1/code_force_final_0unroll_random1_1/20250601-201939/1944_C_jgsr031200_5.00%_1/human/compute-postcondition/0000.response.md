Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set.**

In this final state, the initial list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `nums` variable is now a dictionary created by counting the occurrences of each element in `arr` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. The `start` variable is initialized to 0, and the `vis` variable is an empty set, ready to be used for keeping track of visited elements or states in a potential subsequent algorithm.
