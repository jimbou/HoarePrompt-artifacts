#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts minus the number of times each element was visited in the loop, vis is a set containing all the elements from arr that were visited in the loop, start is the last element that was visited in the loop.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the last element that was visited in the loop

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the last element that was visited in a loop that iterates through the list, decrementing the count of each element and its next consecutive element if present, until it reaches an element that has no next consecutive element. The function also returns without any output value.
