Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a Counter from the collections module to count the occurrences of each number in the input array. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to the maximum number in the array, decrementing the count of each number and its successor (if it exists) until it finds a number that has a count of 0. At this point, it prints the current number plus 1, which represents the MEX of the resulting array.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always choose the smallest number that has not been chosen yet, and Bob will always choose the next smallest number. By decrementing the counts of each number and its successor, the program effectively simulates this strategy and finds the MEX of the resulting array.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is called without being defined in the scope of the main program. To fix this, the function definition should be moved above the main program.

Correctness: **True**
