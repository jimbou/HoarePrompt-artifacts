Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program takes as input the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the initial colors of the squares.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right squares are of the same color. If they are not, it then checks if there are any adjacent squares of different colors in the first and last rows, or in the first and last columns. If there are no such adjacent squares, it means that it is impossible to make all squares the same color, and the program outputs "NO".

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the top-left and bottom-right squares are of the same color. In this case, it is possible to make all squares the same color if and only if all squares in the grid are already the same color. The program does not check for this condition, and therefore may output "YES" incorrectly.

For example, consider the input:

    1
    2 2
    WB
    BW

The program will output "YES", but it is actually impossible to make all squares the same color.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
