The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains a sequence of lines where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), then `t` test cases. Since the first line is read and assigned to `t`, the remaining input in stdin will be `t` test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), then `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' and 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases where each test case starts with a line containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), then `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' and 'B'.**
