Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It checks if the top-left and bottom-right characters are different, and if so, it checks if there is a row or column where all characters are the same. If it finds such a row or column, it sets the answer to 'NO', because it is impossible to change the color of the top-left character to the bottom-right character without changing the color of the characters in that row or column. If it doesn't find such a row or column, it sets the answer to 'YES', because it is possible to change the color of the top-left character to the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of the character.

Correctness: **True**
