stdin contains a sequence of inputs: first an integer, then a sequence of pairs of integers, then a sequence of strings of 'W's and 'B's. The first integer is a positive integer. The pairs of integers are positive integers. The number of pairs is equal to the first integer. The number of strings in each sequence is equal to the first integer in the pair. The length of each string is equal to the second integer in the pair.
