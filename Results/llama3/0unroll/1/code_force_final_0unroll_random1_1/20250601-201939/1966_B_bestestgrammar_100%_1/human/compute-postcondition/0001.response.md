Output State: **The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of the character. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' separated by newline characters, with the number of lines equal to the number of test cases.**
