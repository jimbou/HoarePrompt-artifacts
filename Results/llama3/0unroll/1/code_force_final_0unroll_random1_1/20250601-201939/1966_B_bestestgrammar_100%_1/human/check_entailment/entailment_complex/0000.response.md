Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It then checks if the top-left character is different from the bottom-right character. If they are different, it checks if there is a row or column where all characters are the same, which would make it impossible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character. If such a row or column is found, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the cases where it is impossible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character, which are when the top-left and bottom-right characters are different and there is a row or column where all characters are the same. In all other cases, it is possible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of the character.

Correctness: **True**
