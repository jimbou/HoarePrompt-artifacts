Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. 

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right squares are of the same color. If they are not, it checks if there is a row or column where all squares are of the same color as the top-left square. If such a row or column exists, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. If no such row or column exists, it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid has only one row or one column, and it correctly handles the case where the top-left and bottom-right squares are of the same color.

Correctness: **True**
