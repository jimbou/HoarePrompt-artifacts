Functionality: **The function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It then determines whether it is possible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of the character. The function prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible and 'NO' otherwise, with the output consisting of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' separated by newline characters, one for each test case.**
