Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, but there is a row or column that contains only one color. In this case, the program will incorrectly output "NO" even though it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, but the first row contains only one color (B). The program will incorrectly output "NO" even though it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to B.

The program should be modified to check for this case and output "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
