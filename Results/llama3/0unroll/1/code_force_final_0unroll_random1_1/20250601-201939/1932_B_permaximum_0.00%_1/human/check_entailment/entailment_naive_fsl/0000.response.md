Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the year when the sign will occur by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity (or the periodicity itself if the remainder is 0) to the current year. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the signs have different periodicities
* When the signs have the same periodicity
* When the signs occur in the same year
* When the signs occur in different years

The program also handles edge cases, such as:

* When the input list is empty
* When the input list contains only one element
* When the input list contains duplicate elements

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
