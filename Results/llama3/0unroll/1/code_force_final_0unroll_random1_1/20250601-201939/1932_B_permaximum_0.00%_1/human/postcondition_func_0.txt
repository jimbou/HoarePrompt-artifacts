This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of each test case's integers by iteratively adding the current year to the remainder of the year divided by each integer, or the integer itself if the remainder is zero. The function then prints the total year after processing all integers in each test case, resulting in a series of integers as output.
