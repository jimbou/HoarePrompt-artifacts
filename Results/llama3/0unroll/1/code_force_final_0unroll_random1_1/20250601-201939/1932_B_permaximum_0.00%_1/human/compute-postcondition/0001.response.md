Output State: **The output state will be the sum of the least common multiple (LCM) of each test case's integers, printed on separate lines. The LCM is calculated by adding the current year to the remainder of the year divided by each integer, or the integer itself if the remainder is zero. The final output will be a series of integers, each representing the total year after processing all integers in each test case.**
