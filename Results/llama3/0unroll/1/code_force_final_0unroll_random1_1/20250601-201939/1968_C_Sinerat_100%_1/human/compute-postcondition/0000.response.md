Output State: **The output state will be a sequence of lines where each line contains a sequence of integers. The number of lines will be equal to the value of t in the initial state. Each line will contain n integers, where n is the value of n in the corresponding iteration of the loop. The integers in each line will be the cumulative sum of the integers in the corresponding line of the initial state, starting from 1000.**
