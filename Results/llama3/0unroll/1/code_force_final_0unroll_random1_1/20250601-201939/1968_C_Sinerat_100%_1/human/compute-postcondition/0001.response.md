Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, followed by n-1 integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of these integers, starting from 1000, and prints the resulting sequence of integers. The function repeats this process for each test case, producing a sequence of lines as output, where each line contains the cumulative sum of the corresponding input line.**
