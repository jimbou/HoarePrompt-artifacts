Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints the result for each test case, which is either 1, the ceiling of k/2, or k/2 + 1, depending on the values of n and k. The function processes all test cases and outputs the corresponding results.**
