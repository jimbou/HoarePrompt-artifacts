Functionality: **This function reads a series of input strings from stdin, checks if each string contains exactly two unique characters, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If the string is not a two-character string, it prints the sorted or reverse-sorted version of the string, depending on whether the original string was already sorted or not. The function processes multiple input strings, as specified by the initial integer input, and empties the stdin after execution.**
