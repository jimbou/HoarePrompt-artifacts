The code `n = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t+1 inputs, where the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). This integer t is assigned to n. The remaining t inputs are strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t inputs: strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.**
