Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, followed by either the sorted or reverse-sorted version of the input strings, depending on whether the input strings are already sorted or not. The number of output lines will be 2n, where n is the initial value of the variable 'n'. The value of 'n' will be 0 after the loop finishes executing. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.**
