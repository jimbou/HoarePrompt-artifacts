Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is set to the kth element of the first list of integers in `a`, which is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The list `ind` is initialized as an empty list, and the variable `c` is set to 0. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid, including the structure and constraints of the list `a`.
