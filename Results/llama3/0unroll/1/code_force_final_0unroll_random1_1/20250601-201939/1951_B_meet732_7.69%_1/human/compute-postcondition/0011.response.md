Postcondition: **The list `ind` contains the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than `x`, and the variable `c` is equal to 2. The loop has iterated over the list `a` until it found one element greater than `x`, or until it has iterated over the entire list, whichever came first. The variables `a`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The list `ind` is not empty and currently contains only one element, which is 0, indicating that the first element of `a` is greater than `x`.**
