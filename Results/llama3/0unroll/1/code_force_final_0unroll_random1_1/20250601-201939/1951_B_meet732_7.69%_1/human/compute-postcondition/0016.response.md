Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the second index in the list 'ind' minus 1 and 'k' minus 1. The second index in the list 'ind' is greater than 0 because the first index is 0 and the list 'ind' contains exactly two elements. The value of 'k' is unknown but the returned value is one less than either the second index in 'ind' or 'k'.**
