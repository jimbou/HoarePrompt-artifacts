Postcondition: **The list ind contains the indices of the first two elements in the list a that are greater than x, and the variable c is equal to 2. The loop has iterated over the list a until it found two elements greater than x, or until it has iterated over the entire list, whichever came first. The variables a, x, and n remain unchanged. The list ind is not empty.**
