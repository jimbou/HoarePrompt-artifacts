Postcondition: **The list ind is empty, the variable c is equal to 2, the list a, the variable x, and the variable n remain unchanged. The loop has iterated over the list a until it found two elements greater than x, or until it has iterated over the entire list, whichever came first. The current value of k is 14, and the list ind is being printed.**
