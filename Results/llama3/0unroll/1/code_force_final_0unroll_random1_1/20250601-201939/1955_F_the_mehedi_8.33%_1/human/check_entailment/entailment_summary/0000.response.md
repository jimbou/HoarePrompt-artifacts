Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program first checks if the first three numbers (representing the count of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are the same and odd. If they are, it increments the counter by 1, because in this case, Bob can win when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

Then, for each number in the input, the program increments the counter by half of the number's value. This is because each number can be paired with another number to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, allowing Bob to win. The `math.floor(x / 2)` expression calculates the maximum number of such pairs that can be formed.

The program repeats this process for each test case, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
