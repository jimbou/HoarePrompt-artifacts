This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. It then calculates and prints the total number of times a counter can be incremented based on the values in each line. The counter is incremented if the first three integers are the same and odd, and also for each integer in the line, the counter is incremented by half of the integer's value. The function repeats this process for a number of lines specified by the first integer read from standard input.
