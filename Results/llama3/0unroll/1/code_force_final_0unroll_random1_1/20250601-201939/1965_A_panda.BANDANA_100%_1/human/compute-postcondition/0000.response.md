Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, and the integers on the second line are positive integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now a positive integer, which was assigned from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, since one test case has been read. The rest of the information from the initial state is still valid, including the fact that `n` is a positive integer and the integers on the second line are positive integers.
