This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. It then determines the winner of a game based on the unique integers in each test case, printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console for each test case. The winner is determined by the presence of 1 in the unique integers, the number of unique integers, and the differences between consecutive unique integers. If 1 is not present or there is only one unique integer, 'Alice' wins. Otherwise, the function checks the differences between consecutive unique integers, and if a difference greater than 1 is found, the winner is determined by the index of the larger integer. If no such difference is found, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of unique integers.
