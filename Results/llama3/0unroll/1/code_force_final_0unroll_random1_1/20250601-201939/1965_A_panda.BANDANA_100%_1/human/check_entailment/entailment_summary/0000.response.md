Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the unique integers in each test case. The program first checks if 1 is not present in the unique integers or if there is only one unique integer, in which case 'Alice' wins. Otherwise, it checks the differences between consecutive unique integers. If a difference greater than 1 is found, the winner is determined by the index of the larger integer. If no such difference is found, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of unique integers. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
