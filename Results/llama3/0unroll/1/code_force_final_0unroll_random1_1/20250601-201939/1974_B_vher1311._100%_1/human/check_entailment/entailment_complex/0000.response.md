Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of each string, and the strings themselves.
2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string.
3. Inside the function, the program creates a string `r` that consists of all distinct letters of the encoded string `b`, in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted` and `set` functions.
4. The program then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`. This is done using a dictionary comprehension.
5. The program applies this mapping to the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped counterpart, using a generator expression.
6. The program returns the resulting decoded string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The function `func_1` correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
