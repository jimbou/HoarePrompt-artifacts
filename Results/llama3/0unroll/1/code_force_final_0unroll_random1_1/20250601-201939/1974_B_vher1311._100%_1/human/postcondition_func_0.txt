The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters, removes duplicate characters, sorts them, and creates a mapping where each character is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted string. It then applies this mapping to the original string, replacing each character with its mapped counterpart, and returns the resulting string.
