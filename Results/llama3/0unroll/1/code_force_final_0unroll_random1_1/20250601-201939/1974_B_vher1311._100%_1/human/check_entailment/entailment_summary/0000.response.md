Reasoning:

The provided program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by removing duplicate characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `set` function to remove duplicates and the `sorted` function to sort the characters.

2. The program then creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of `r`. This is done using a dictionary comprehension, where each character `r[i]` is mapped to `r[-(i + 1)]`.

3. Finally, the program applies this mapping to the encoded string `b`, replacing each character with its mapped counterpart. This is done using a generator expression, where each character `char` in `b` is replaced with `mapping[char]`.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
