Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input and returns the original string `s`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the auxiliary string `r` consists of all distinct letters of the string `s`, written in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`.

3. Finally, the program uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding original character. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the decoding happens by replacing each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and produces the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

Correctness: **True**
