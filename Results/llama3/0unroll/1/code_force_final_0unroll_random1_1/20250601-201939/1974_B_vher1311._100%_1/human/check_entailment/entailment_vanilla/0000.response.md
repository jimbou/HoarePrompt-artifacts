Reasoning:

1. The problem description is clear and well-defined. It explains the encoding process and asks for a program to perform the decoding.

2. The provided Python program appears to be a solution to the problem. It reads input from the standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. This function first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string. Then, it creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character.

4. The program uses a list comprehension to generate the decoded string, which is a concise and efficient way to perform the decoding.

5. The program does not contain any obvious syntax errors or logical flaws. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

6. The program's time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation in the `func_1` function, where n is the length of the encoded string. This is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

7. The program's space complexity is O(n) because it creates a new string `r` and a dictionary `mapping` to store the decoded characters. This is also acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
