Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. Then, it creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   Strings with duplicate characters: The `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the encoded string, ensuring that each character in `r` is unique.
*   Strings with characters in any order: The `sorted` function is used to sort the characters in `r`, ensuring that the mapping is correct regardless of the order of characters in the encoded string.
*   Strings of any length: The program uses a loop to iterate over each character in the encoded string, ensuring that it can handle strings of any length.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
