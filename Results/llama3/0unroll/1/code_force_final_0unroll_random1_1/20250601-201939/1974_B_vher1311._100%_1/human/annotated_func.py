#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each letter is the reversed mapping of the corresponding letter in the encoded string, as defined in the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters, removes duplicate characters, sorts them, and creates a mapping where each character is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted string. It then applies this mapping to the original string, replacing each character with its mapped counterpart, and returns the resulting string.
