Output State: **encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string consisting of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order, mapping is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sorts the unique characters in the `encoded` string in alphabetical order and assigns the result to the variable `r`. The second line creates a dictionary `mapping` where each key-value pair consists of a character from `r` and its corresponding reversed mapping. The reversed mapping is obtained by taking the character at the index `- (i + 1)` in the string `r`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted string. This means that the first character in `r` is mapped to the last character, the second character is mapped to the second last character, and so on.
