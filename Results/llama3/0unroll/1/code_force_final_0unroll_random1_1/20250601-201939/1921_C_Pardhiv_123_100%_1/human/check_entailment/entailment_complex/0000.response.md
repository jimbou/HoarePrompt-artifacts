Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.
2.  The program initializes a list `ls` with `n+1` elements, where `ls[0]` is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` integers from the second line of the input.
3.  The program then iterates through the list `ls` from index 1 to `n`. In each iteration, it subtracts the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` from `f`. This correctly calculates the charge consumed by the phone for each message.
4.  After the iteration, the program checks if `f` is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
5.  The program repeats this process for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct, and it accurately implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
