The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1}. The first integer of the first test case is assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains the rest of the test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1}.**
