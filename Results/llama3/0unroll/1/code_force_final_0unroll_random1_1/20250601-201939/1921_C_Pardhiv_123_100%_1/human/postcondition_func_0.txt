This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The function then iterates through the integers m_i, subtracting the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b from f. After the iteration, it prints 'YES' if f is greater than 0 and 'NO' otherwise, repeating this process for each test case.
