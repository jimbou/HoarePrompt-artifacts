stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b, where n is the number of messages, f is the initial phone's charge, a is the charge consumption per unit of time, and b is the consumption when turned off and on sequentially. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where m_i is the moment at which the i-th message needs to be sent. 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9, and 1 <= m_i <= 10^9.
