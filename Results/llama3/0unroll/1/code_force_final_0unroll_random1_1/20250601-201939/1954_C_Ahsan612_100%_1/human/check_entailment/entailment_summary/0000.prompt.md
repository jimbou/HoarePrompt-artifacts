Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        new = [None] * len(a)
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new)))
        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new2)))





# Execution Summary:
The function takes as input a series of pairs of strings consisting of digits from 1 to 9, compares the corresponding characters of each pair, and prints two new strings for each pair. The first string contains the maximum value for each pair of characters, and the second string contains the minimum value for each pair of characters. If the characters at the first mismatched position are different, the remaining characters in the strings are swapped. The function repeats this process for a number of pairs specified by the input, and produces a total of 2t output strings, where t is the number of pairs.
