Output State: **The output state contains 2t strings, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length as the input strings. The strings are the result of comparing the corresponding characters of the input strings x and y, and printing the maximum and minimum values for each pair of characters. If the characters at the first mismatched position are different, the remaining characters in the strings are swapped.**
