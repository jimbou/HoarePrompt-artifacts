Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even, and if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, or if the condition is not met, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles, and where it cannot be cut into two equal rectangles. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is even is also correct.

The program's logic is consistent with the problem description and the example inputs and outputs provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
