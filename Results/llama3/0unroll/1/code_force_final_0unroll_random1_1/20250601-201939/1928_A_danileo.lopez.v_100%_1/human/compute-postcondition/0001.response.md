Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each with either 'Yes' or 'No'. For each line, if the corresponding input values a and b are both odd, the output will be 'No'. If either a or b is even, the output will be 'Yes' if the other number is equal to half of the even number, and 'No' otherwise.**
