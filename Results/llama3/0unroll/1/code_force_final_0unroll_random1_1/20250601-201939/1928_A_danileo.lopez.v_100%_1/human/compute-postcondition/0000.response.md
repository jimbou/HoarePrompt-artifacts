The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The input contains multiple lines, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). After reading this integer, the input still contains `t` lines, each with two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each with two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
