Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The logic is as follows:

- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal parts. If the resulting parts have different dimensions than the original rectangle, Bob can form a new rectangle. This is handled by the first if statement.

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he can only cut the rectangle into two identical parts, which would result in the same rectangle. This is handled by the else statement.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each test case.
