This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple pairs of integers, and outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair based on specific conditions. It checks if either number in a pair is even and if the other number is equal to half of the even number, printing 'Yes' if the condition is met and 'No' otherwise. If both numbers in a pair are odd, it prints 'No'. The function processes a specified number of pairs (t) and outputs the results accordingly.
