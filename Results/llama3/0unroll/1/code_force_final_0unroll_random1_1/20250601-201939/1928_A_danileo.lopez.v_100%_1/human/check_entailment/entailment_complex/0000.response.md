Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and rotating/moving them. The program checks if either the length (a) or the width (b) of the rectangle is even. If either a or b is even, it checks if the other number is equal to half of the even number. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. If not, it prints 'No'.

The program also handles the case where both a and b are odd, in which case it prints 'No' because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly identifies the conditions under which Bob can obtain another rectangle and prints the corresponding output.

Correctness: **True**
