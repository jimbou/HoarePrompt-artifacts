Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if either a or b is even. If either of them is even, it checks if the other number is equal to half of the even number. If it is, then the program prints 'No', because in this case, Bob cannot obtain another rectangle. If the other number is not equal to half of the even number, then the program prints 'Yes', because in this case, Bob can obtain another rectangle.

If both a and b are odd, then the program prints 'No', because in this case, Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
