Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sums of the number of '<' and '>' characters, respectively, from the left and right ends of the grid. The program then iterates through the grid, using the values in A and B to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball is placed on the leftmost or rightmost cell of the grid. The program also correctly handles the case when the pinball is placed on a cell with a '<' character and there are no '>' characters to its left, or when the pinball is placed on a cell with a '>' character and there are no '<' characters to its right.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the grid, which is efficient for the given problem constraints. The program's space complexity is also O(n), which is reasonable given the need to store the cumulative sums in lists A and B.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
