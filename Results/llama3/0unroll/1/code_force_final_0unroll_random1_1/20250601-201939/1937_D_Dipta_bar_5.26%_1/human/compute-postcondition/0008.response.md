Functionality: **This function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers to the console. The sequence is calculated based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the string, with each number representing a specific value derived from the positions and counts of these characters. The function does not return any value but instead outputs the calculated sequence directly to the console.**
