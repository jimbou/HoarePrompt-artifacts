Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell. The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to move from the left and right ends of the grid, respectively. The program then uses these lists to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball is placed on the leftmost or rightmost cell, or when the grid consists of only one cell. The program also correctly handles the case when the grid consists of only '>' or '<' characters.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the grid, which is efficient for the given constraints. The program's space complexity is also O(n), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
