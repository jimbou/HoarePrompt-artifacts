Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', of length n, where n is a positive integer, n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list**

The code assigns the length of string `s` to variable `n`, which is a positive integer. It then initializes two empty lists, `A` and `idx_A`. The string `s` remains unchanged, consisting of characters '<' and '>', with a length equal to the value of `n`.
