Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code snippet initializes two new empty lists, B and idx_B, but does not modify the existing variables A, idx_A, s, or n. Therefore, the final state includes the unchanged values of A, idx_A, s, and n, along with the newly introduced empty lists B and idx_B.
