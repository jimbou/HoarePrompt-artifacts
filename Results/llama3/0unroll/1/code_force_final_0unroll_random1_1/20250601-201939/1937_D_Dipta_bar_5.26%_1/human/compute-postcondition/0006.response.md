Output State: **B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of integers, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, l is 0, r is the length of B.**

The code initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, without modifying any existing variables. The value of `l` is set to 0, and the value of `r` is set to the length of the list `B`. The rest of the variables (`B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `idx_A`, `s`, and `n`) remain unchanged, retaining their initial values.
