Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to move from the left and right borders to each cell, respectively. The program then uses these arrays to calculate the total number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the pinball is placed on the left or right border, and when the pinball moves to the left or right. The program also correctly handles the case when the pinball is placed on a cell with a '<' character, in which case it moves to the left, and when the pinball is placed on a cell with a '>' character, in which case it moves to the right.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the pinball's movement. The program's use of arrays A and B to store the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to move from the left and right borders to each cell, respectively, is a clever and efficient way to solve the problem.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
