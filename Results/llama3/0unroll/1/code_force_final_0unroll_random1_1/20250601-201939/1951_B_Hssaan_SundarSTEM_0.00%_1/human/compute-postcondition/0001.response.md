Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a list of distinct integers and a target position. It swaps the first element with the element at the target position, then calculates the maximum number of elements that can be removed while maintaining the condition that the first element is greater than or equal to the last element. The function performs this calculation twice, once with the original list and once with the list modified by swapping the element at the target position with the element at the position of the first occurrence of the original first element. The function prints the maximum of these two calculations for each test case.**
