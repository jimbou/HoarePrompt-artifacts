Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The program checks the following conditions:

- If n equals m, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n times in a row.
- If m is greater than n, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is one less than n, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add n-1 cubes and then remove 1 cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach m.

The program correctly covers all possible scenarios based on the problem description and the execution summary. It accurately determines whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
