Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The program checks for the following conditions:

- If n is equal to m, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n times in a row.
- If m is greater than n, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is one less than n, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower n-1 times and then remove 1 cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired number of cubes.

However, the program does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, it does not handle the case where m is less than n but not one less than n, and n and m have different parities.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
