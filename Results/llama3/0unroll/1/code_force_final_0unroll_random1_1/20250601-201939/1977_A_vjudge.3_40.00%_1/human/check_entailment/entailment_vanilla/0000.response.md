Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m.

1. If n equals m, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube at a time to build a tower of m cubes.

2. If m is greater than n, the program prints 'No', which is also correct because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he makes.

3. If m equals n - 1, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add n - 1 cubes and then remove one cube to end up with m cubes.

4. The program then checks if both m and n are even or both are odd. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if both m and n are even, Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to end up with m cubes. Similarly, if both m and n are odd, Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs and then add or remove one more cube to end up with m cubes.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'. This is also correct because if m and n have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), Nikita cannot end up with m cubes after n moves.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is not necessary and can be removed. The correct logic is to check if the difference between n and m is even. If it is, then Nikita can end up with m cubes after n moves.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Correctness: **False**
