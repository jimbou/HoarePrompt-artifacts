Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower can only be odd or even, and it can only change by 1 in each move. Therefore, if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it is not possible.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of n and m and printing "Yes" if they have the same parity, and "No" otherwise. The special cases where n == m, m > n, and m == n - 1 are also correctly handled.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
