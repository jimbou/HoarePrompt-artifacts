Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following conditions:

- If n is equal to m, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding n cubes.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding n-1 cubes and then removing one cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints 'Yes' if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
