Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` in the range `[0, n)` for which `func_1(max_index, i, max_index, i)` returns `=`, `min_index` is the first index in `min_indices`**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be the first index in the list `min_indices`. The list `min_indices` remains unchanged, still containing all indices `i` in the range `[0, n)` for which `func_1(max_index, i, max_index, i)` returns `=`.
