Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

The program first checks if the input size `n` is 2, in which case it directly outputs the answer as `! 0 1` because for `n = 2`, the maximum XOR value can be obtained by taking the two elements as 0 and 1.

For `n > 2`, the program first finds the index of the maximum element in the sequence `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum element using the `func_1` function. This is done to ensure that the maximum element is found, which will be used later to find the minimum element that gives the maximum XOR value.

Once the maximum element is found, the program finds all indices of the minimum elements that give the same maximum XOR value when compared with the maximum element. This is done by comparing each element with the current minimum element using the `func_1` function.

Finally, the program outputs the indices of the maximum and minimum elements that give the maximum XOR value using the `func_2` function.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also handles all potential cases, including the case where `n = 2` and the case where `n > 2`. Therefore, the program is correct.
