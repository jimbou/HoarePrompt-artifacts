Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized. The program uses a query-based approach, where it asks queries in the form of "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR operations of pairs of elements in the sequence.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` takes four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as input, prints a query in the format "? a b c d", waits for user input, and returns the user's input as a string. `func_2` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, prints the values of `a` and `b` to the console, and flushes the output buffer. `func_3` is the main function that takes a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 as input and performs the following actions:

1. If `n` is equal to 2, it calls `func_2` with arguments 0 and 1 and returns.
2. It finds the index `max_index` that corresponds to the maximum value in the sequence by iterating over the range `[0, n)` and comparing the bitwise OR operations of pairs of elements using `func_1`.
3. It finds the indices `min_indices` that correspond to the minimum values in the sequence by iterating over the range `[0, n)` and comparing the bitwise OR operations of pairs of elements using `func_1`.
4. It finds the index `min_index` that corresponds to the minimum value in the sequence by iterating over the `min_indices` list and comparing the bitwise OR operations of pairs of elements using `func_1`.
5. It calls `func_2` with arguments `max_index` and `min_index`.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing its logic and the properties of the bitwise XOR operation. The program's approach is based on the observation that the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized when `p_i` and `p_j` have the maximum and minimum values in the sequence, respectively.

The program's logic is correct because it:

* Finds the maximum value in the sequence using `func_1` and stores its index in `max_index`.
* Finds the minimum values in the sequence using `func_1` and stores their indices in `min_indices`.
* Finds the minimum value in the sequence by iterating over the `min_indices` list and comparing the bitwise OR operations of pairs of elements using `func_1`.
* Calls `func_2` with arguments `max_index` and `min_index`, which prints the values of `max_index` and `min_index` to the console.

Therefore, the program correctly finds two indices `i` and `j` in the secret sequence `p` such that the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
