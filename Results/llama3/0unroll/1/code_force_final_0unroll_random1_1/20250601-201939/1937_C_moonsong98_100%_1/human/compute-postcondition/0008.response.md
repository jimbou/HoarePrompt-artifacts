Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains the same, and it is still an integer larger than or equal to 2, but not equal to 2. The value of `max_index` is still `n-1`. A new variable `min_indices` is introduced, which is a list containing the value of `max_index`, which is `n-1`. The stdin still contains no input.
