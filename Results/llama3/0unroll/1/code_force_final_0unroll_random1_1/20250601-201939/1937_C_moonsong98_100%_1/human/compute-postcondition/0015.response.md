Functionality: **The function takes a positive integer n greater than or equal to 2 as input and performs the following actions:**

*   If n is 2, it calls the function func_2 with arguments 0 and 1, and then returns without any output.
*   If n is greater than 2, it finds the maximum index (max_index) by comparing the results of func_1 with different indices.
*   It then finds all indices (min_indices) that are equal to the maximum index by comparing the results of func_1 with max_index and other indices.
*   From the list of min_indices, it finds the first index (min_index) that is equal to itself by comparing the results of func_1 with min_index and other indices.
*   Finally, it calls the function func_2 with max_index and min_index as arguments, and then returns without any output.
