The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_index`. The initial state of `n` is an integer larger than or equal to 2, and `n` is not equal to 2. The stdin contains no input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input.**
