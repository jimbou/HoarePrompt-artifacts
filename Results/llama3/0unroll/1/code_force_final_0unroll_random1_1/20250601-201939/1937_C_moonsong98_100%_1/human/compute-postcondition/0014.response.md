Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` in the range `[0, n)` for which `func_1(max_index, i, max_index, i)` returns `=`, `min_index` is the first index in `min_indices` for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `=`, and `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `min_indices` and `min_index` remain unchanged, as the code only executes the function `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments, without modifying these variables. The execution of `func_2` does not affect the values of `min_indices` and `min_index`, so they retain their original values.
