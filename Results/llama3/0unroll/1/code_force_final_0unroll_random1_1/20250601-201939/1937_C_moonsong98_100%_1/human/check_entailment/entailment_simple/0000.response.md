Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. Function 1 (`func_1`) is used to ask queries to the jury. It takes four indices a, b, c, and d as input and prints the query "? a b c d". The program then reads the response from the jury and returns it as a string.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`) is used to print the answer to the problem. It takes two indices a and b as input and prints "! a b".

3. Function 3 (`func_3`) is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the number of elements n in the secret sequence p. If n is 2, it directly prints the answer "! 0 1" because for n = 2, p_0 ⊕ p_1 is always maximized.

4. For n > 2, the program first finds the index of the maximum element in the sequence p. It does this by comparing each element with the current maximum element using function 1. The index of the maximum element is stored in `max_index`.

5. Next, the program finds all indices i such that p_i is equal to the minimum element in the sequence p. It does this by comparing each element with the maximum element using function 1. The indices of the minimum elements are stored in `min_indices`.

6. The program then finds the index of the minimum element that is equal to the minimum element in the sequence p. It does this by comparing each minimum element with the current minimum element using function 1. The index of the minimum element is stored in `min_index`.

7. Finally, the program prints the answer "! max_index min_index" using function 2.

The program uses at most 3n queries to find the answer, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
