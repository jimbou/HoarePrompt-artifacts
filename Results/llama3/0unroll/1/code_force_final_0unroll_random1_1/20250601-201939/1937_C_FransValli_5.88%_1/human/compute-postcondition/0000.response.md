Output State: **The loop will output the maximum number of pairs of numbers that can be formed from the input numbers, where the first number in each pair is less than the second number. The output will be in the format "k best", where k is the first number in the pair and best is the second number in the pair. The output will be repeated for each iteration of the outer loop.**
