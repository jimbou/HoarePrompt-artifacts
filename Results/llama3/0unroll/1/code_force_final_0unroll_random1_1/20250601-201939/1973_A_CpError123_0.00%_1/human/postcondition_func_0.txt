This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three integers between 0 and 30, and returns a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates the total points and checks if it's even. If it's not, it appends -1 to the result list. If it is, it calculates the total matches and checks if it's within a valid range. If it's not, it appends -1 to the result list. If it is, it calculates the number of equalities and appends it to the result list if it's non-negative, otherwise appends -1. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 30, without modifying the input list.
