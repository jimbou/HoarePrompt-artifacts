Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case (0, 2, 3). According to the problem description, the scores should be p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3, but in this case, p_2 > p_1. The program should return -1 for this case, but it returns 1.

Also, the program does not work correctly for the case (1, 1, 10). The total number of points is 12, which is not a multiple of 2, so the program should return -1. However, the program returns 2.

The program also does not work correctly for the case (0, 0, 6). The total number of points is 6, which is not a multiple of 2, so the program should return -1. However, the program returns 0.

The program only works correctly for the cases (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), and (1, 1, 2).
