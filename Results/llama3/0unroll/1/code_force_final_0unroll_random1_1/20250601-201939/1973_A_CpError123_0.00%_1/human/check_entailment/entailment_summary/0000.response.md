Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program checks if the total points are even, if the total matches are within a valid range, and if the number of equalities is non-negative. If any of these conditions are not met, it correctly returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of equalities and returns it.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results, in which case it returns -1.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, returning a list of integers where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 30.

Correctness: **True**
