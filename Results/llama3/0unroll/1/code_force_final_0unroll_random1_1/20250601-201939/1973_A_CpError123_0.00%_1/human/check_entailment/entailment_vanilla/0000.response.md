Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first checks if the total number of points is odd. If it is, the program immediately returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario.

2. The program then calculates the total number of matches played by dividing the total number of points by 2.

3. The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches. If either of these conditions is true, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario.

4. The program then calculates the number of draws by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score and the second-highest score, and twice the difference between the highest score and the lowest score, from the total number of points.

5. If the calculated number of draws is negative, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario.

6. Otherwise, the program returns the calculated number of draws divided by 2, as each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles invalid scenarios and calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

However, there is a small issue with the test cases provided. The third test case (0, 2, 3) is not a valid input, as the scores are not in non-decreasing order. The program will still produce a result for this test case, but it may not be accurate.

Correctness: **True**
