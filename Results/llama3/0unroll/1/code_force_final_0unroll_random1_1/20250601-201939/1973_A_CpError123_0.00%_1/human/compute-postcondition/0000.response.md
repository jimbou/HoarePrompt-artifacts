Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `resultats` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `cas_de_test`, remain unchanged. The list `cas_de_test` still contains lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `t` is still a positive integer.
