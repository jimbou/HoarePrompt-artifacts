The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). 

Since the code only reads an integer from the standard input, the values of n, m, a_i, and b_i are not affected. However, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to the variable `cases`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9), but the first line of the first test case has been read.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9), but the first line of the first test case has been read.**
