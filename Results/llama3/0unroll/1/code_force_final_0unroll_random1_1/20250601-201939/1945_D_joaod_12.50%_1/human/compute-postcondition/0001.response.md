Output State: **The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables in the loop head and body. The variable `cases` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `na_frente` has been decremented by 1 in each iteration, so its final value is `na_frente - cases`. The variable `pos_final` has also been decremented by 1 in each iteration, so its final value is `pos_final - cases`. The variable `total` has been updated in each iteration, so its final value is the sum of all the values of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive). The variable `best` has been updated in each iteration, so its final value is the minimum of all the values of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` in the range `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive). The output state is the final state of these variables after all the iterations of the loop have finished.**
