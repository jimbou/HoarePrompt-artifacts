Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each, representing the costs of swapping and passing at each position.

The program correctly initializes variables, reads input, and calculates the minimum cost to move from the first position to the last position. It considers the costs of swapping and passing at each position and updates the total cost accordingly. The program also keeps track of the best (minimum) cost found so far and updates it if a better cost is found.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It handles edge cases, such as when the cost of swapping is less than the cost of passing, and updates the total cost accordingly.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
