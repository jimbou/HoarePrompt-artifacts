You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = 10 ** 12
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables in the loop head and body. The variable `cases` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `na_frente` has been decremented by 1 in each iteration, so its final value is `na_frente - cases`. The variable `pos_final` has also been decremented by 1 in each iteration, so its final value is `pos_final - cases`. The variable `total` has been updated in each iteration, so its final value is the sum of all the values of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive). The variable `best` has been updated in each iteration, so its final value is the minimum of all the values of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` in the range `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive). The output state is the final state of these variables after all the iterations of the loop have finished.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
