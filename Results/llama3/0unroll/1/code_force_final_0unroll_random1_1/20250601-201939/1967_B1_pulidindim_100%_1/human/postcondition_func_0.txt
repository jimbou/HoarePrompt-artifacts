This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of n and the number of times a while loop runs, where the loop runs as long as a certain condition involving n and a counter is met. The counter is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the sum is updated based on the integer division of n by the counter. The function executes this process for a number of test cases specified by the input, printing the final sum for each test case.
