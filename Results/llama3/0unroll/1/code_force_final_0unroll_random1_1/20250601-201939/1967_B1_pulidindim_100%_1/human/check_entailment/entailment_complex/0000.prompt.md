Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will print the value of ans, which is the sum of n and the number of times the while loop runs. The while loop runs as long as count is less than or equal to m and n divided by count is greater than or equal to count minus 1. In each iteration of the while loop, ans is incremented by the integer division of n divided by count minus count minus 1, plus 1. The value of count is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The final value of ans is printed after the while loop finishes. The value of t is not changed by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of n and the number of times a while loop runs, where the loop runs as long as a certain condition involving n and a counter is met. The counter is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the sum is updated based on the integer division of n by the counter. The function executes this process for a number of test cases specified by the input, printing the final sum for each test case.
