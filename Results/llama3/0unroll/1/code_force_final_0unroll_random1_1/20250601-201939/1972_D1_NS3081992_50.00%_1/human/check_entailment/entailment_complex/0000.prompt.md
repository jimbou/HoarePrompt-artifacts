Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list containing the results of func_7() repeated 'rows' times, where 'rows' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of results by repeating the execution of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or processing, effectively echoing the input string.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a positive integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a positive integer that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.

#Function 11:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string input containing two space-separated positive integers and returns a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer separated by a space in the input string.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer and a key in d, rank is a list of integers.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1

    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer and a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000, and the length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer and a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and the length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, plus 1, which is equal to `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, integer `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, temporarily marking each element as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate a minimum value. The function then updates the `rank` list with this minimum value plus 1 and returns the same value. The function effectively assigns a rank to the input `da` based on the minimum rank of its dependencies.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1

    #State: a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y, x, and g are the return values of func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a), otherwise it recursively calls func_13 to compute the GCD and coefficients. The function returns a tuple containing the coefficients y and x - a // b * y, and the GCD g.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length n, n and m are positive integers, k is an integer.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: a is a list of integers of length n, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is an integer decreased by the sum of differences between m and each element in a that is less than m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State: a is a list of integers of length n, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is an integer decreased by the sum of differences between m and each element in a that is less than m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is a negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers 'a', positive integers 'n' and 'm', and an integer 'k' as input. It calculates the sum of differences between 'm' and each element in 'a' that is less than 'm', and subtracts this sum from 'k'. If the resulting value of 'k' is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list 'a'.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and m is a positive integer.
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i = sqrt(n + 1), ans = sum of floor((n + i) / (i * i)) for i from 1 to sqrt(n + 1)
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of floor((n + i) / (i * i)) for i from 1 to sqrt(n + 1) minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of the floor division of (n + i) by (i * i) for all integers i from 1 to the square root of (n + 1), then subtracts 1 from the result and returns the final value. The function takes no input parameters and returns an integer value.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific values or relationships are defined for the variables in the function signature, as the function func_16() does not take any parameters and only calls other functions func_10() and func_15() without passing any arguments.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output state is the same as the initial state, as the loop does not modify any variables. The loop only writes the result of func_15() to the standard output, which does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function writes the result of func_15() to the standard output a number of times determined by func_10(), without modifying any variables or affecting the program state.
