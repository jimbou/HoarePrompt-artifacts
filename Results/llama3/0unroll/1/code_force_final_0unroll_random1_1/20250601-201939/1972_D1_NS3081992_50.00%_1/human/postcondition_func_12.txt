This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a), otherwise it recursively calls func_13 to compute the GCD and coefficients. The function returns a tuple containing the coefficients y and x - a // b * y, and the GCD g.
