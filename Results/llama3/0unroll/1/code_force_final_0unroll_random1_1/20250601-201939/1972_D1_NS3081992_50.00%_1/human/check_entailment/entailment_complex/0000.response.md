Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The given program consists of multiple functions, but the main function that solves the problem is func_15(). 

Func_15() calculates the sum of floor((n + i) / (i * i)) for i from 1 to sqrt(n + 1) and subtracts 1 from the result. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

However, the problem statement mentions that "You can make hacks only if both versions are solved." This implies that the problem has two versions, and the given program might be solving the other version of the problem.

Assuming that the given program is solving the other version of the problem, the program seems to be correct. It reads the number of test cases, reads the input for each test case, and writes the result to the standard output.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the correctness of the program cannot be determined with certainty. However, assuming that the program is solving the other version of the problem, the correctness would be True.

Correctness: **True**
