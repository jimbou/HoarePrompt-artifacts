Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses a combination of mathematical functions and algorithms to calculate the number of valid pairs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) from the input.
2.  For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, which represent the upper bounds for a and b, respectively.
3.  The program then uses a while loop to iterate over all possible values of i, where i ranges from 1 to the square root of n + i.
4.  Inside the loop, it calculates the number of valid pairs for the current value of i using the formula (n + i) // (i * i).
5.  The program accumulates the results for all values of i and stores the final answer in the variable ans.
6.  Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

The program's logic is based on the mathematical property that the number of valid pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of divisors of n + i, where i ranges from 1 to the square root of n + i. This property is derived from the condition that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
