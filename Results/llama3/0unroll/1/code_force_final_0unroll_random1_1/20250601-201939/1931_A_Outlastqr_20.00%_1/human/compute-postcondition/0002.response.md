Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string of lowercase English letters, with the first character being the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet, followed by 'zz' if n is greater than 52, or the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'z' if n is greater than 26, or the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'aa' if n is less than or equal to 26. The input state remains unchanged, with stdin containing two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), then t integers n (3 <= n <= 78).**
