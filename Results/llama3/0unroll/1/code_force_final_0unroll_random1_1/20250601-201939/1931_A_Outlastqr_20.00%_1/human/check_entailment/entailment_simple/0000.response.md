Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 52. In this case, the lexicographically smallest word is obtained by subtracting 53 from `n` to get the index of the first letter, and then appending 'zz' to get the smallest possible word.

2. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52. In this case, the lexicographically smallest word is obtained by subtracting 28 from `n` to get the index of the second letter, and then prepending 'a' and appending 'z' to get the smallest possible word.

3. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 26. In this case, the lexicographically smallest word is obtained by subtracting 3 from `n` to get the index of the third letter, and then prepending 'aa' to get the smallest possible word.

4. The program uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` constant to get the lowercase English letters, which is a more efficient and readable way to get the alphabet than hardcoding it.

5. The program uses a loop to handle multiple test cases, which is a good practice.

6. The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
