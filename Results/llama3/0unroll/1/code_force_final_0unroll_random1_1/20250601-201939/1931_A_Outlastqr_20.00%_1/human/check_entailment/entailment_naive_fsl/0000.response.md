Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded from the given integer. 

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the input number `n` is greater than 52. If it is, it means that the first letter of the word must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would only contribute 1 to the sum, and 'b' would contribute 2, and so on). In this case, the program correctly constructs the word by taking the `n-53`th letter of the alphabet (since 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd, and so on) and appending 'zz' to it.

2. If `n` is not greater than 52, the program checks if it is greater than 26. If it is, it means that the first letter of the word must be 'a' (since 'a' contributes 1 to the sum, and 'b' would contribute 2, and so on). In this case, the program correctly constructs the word by taking the `n-28`th letter of the alphabet (since 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd, and so on) and appending 'z' to it.

3. If `n` is not greater than 26, it means that the first letter of the word must be 'a' (since 'a' contributes 1 to the sum, and 'b' would contribute 2, and so on). In this case, the program correctly constructs the word by taking the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet (since 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd, and so on) and appending 'aa' to it.

In all cases, the program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded from the given integer. Therefore, the program is correct.
