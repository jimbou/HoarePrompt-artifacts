Functionality: **This function generates and prints a series of strings based on input integers. It takes an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and t subsequent integers n (3 <= n <= 78) from standard input. For each n, it constructs a string of lowercase English letters: if n > 52, the string starts with the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'; if n > 26, the string starts with 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and ends with 'z'; if n <= 26, the string starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet. The function prints each constructed string, leaving the input state unchanged.**
