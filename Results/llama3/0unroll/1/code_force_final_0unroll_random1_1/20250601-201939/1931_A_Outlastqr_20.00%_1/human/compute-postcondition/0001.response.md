Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of strings, where each string is a three-letter word. The first letter of each word is the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet, the second letter is 'a', and the third letter is 'a' if n is less than or equal to 26, 'z' if n is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, and the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz' if n is greater than 52. The list contains t such words, where t is the integer input at the beginning of the loop. The stdin is empty after the loop executes all the iterations.
