Output State: **prefix_balance is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of open and close parentheses, the index of the current character, and the character itself, sorted by the balance and then by the index in descending order, balance is 0, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, result is a string consisting of the characters in prefix_balance, in the order they appear after sorting.**

In this output state, the `prefix_balance` list has been sorted based on the balance of open and close parentheses and the index of the current character. The `result` variable now holds a string consisting of the characters in `prefix_balance`, in the order they appear after sorting. The other variables, `balance`, `s`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
