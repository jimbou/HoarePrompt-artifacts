#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    n = len(s)

    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))

            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: prefix_balance is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of open and close parentheses, the index of the current character, and the character itself, balance is 0, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string consisting of the characters in prefix_balance, in the order they appear after sorting, where prefix_balance is a list of tuples containing the balance of open and close parentheses, the index of the current character, and the character itself, sorted by the balance and then by the index in descending order, and the balance is 0, and the characters are from a non-empty string s consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reorders a balanced string of parentheses by sorting them based on the balance of open and close parentheses and their original index, returning the reordered string.
