Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is an empty list, balance is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is set to the length of `s`, which is a positive integer since `s` is a non-empty string. The `prefix_balance` list is initialized as an empty list, and the `balance` variable is set to 0.
