#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and infoB, where both balances are integers and are not equal to each other.
    #State: *infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer. infoA.balance is equal to infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA, where both infoA and infoB have the same balance.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, based on their 'balance' and 'position' attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has iterated over the entire string s, and the balance_info list has been populated with BalanceInfo objects containing the balance and index of each character in the string. The balance variable has been updated to reflect the final balance of the string, which is 0 since the string is a balanced parentheses sequence. The string s and the integer n remain unchanged.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: A string composed of the characters from the sorted balance_info list, where the characters are arranged in ascending order of their balance values and descending order of their positions in the string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on their balance values and positions, and returns a new string with the characters rearranged in ascending order of their balance values and descending order of their positions. The original string remains unchanged.
