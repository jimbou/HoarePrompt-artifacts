Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers, where n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.
