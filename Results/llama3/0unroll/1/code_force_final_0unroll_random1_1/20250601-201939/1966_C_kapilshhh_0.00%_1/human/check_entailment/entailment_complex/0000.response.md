Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the line where it prints the winner. Currently, it prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. However, according to the problem description, if `dp` is `False`, it should print 'Bob', not 'Alice'. The correct line should be `print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')`.

Correctness: **False**
