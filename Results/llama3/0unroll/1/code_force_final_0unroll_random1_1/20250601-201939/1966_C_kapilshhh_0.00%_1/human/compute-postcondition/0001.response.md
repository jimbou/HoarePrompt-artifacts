Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `tc` is 0, and the variable `dp` is either `True` or `False` depending on the input values. The variable `n` is the length of the last input list minus 1, and the variable `arr` is the sorted list of unique integers from the last input list in descending order with an additional 0 at the end. The variable `i` is the last index of the loop, which is the length of `arr` minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `tc` is reset to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `dp` holds the result of the last test case, which is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of unique integers are greater than 1. The variable `n` holds the length of the last input list minus 1, and the variable `arr` holds the sorted list of unique integers from the last input list in descending order with an additional 0 at the end. The variable `i` holds the last index of the loop, which is the length of `arr` minus 1.
