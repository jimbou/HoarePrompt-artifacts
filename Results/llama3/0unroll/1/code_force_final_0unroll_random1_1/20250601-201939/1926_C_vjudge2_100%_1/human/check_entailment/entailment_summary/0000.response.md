Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number n.

The program correctly implements the pre-computation approach and uses the stored values to print the sum of digits for each test case. The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of digits for a given number.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test. The program's pre-computation approach may take a significant amount of time to compute the sum of digits for all numbers up to 200,000, which could potentially exceed the time limit.

Despite this potential issue, the program is logically correct and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
