Output State: **num is 0, a is the sum of the digits of the initial num**.

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `num` becomes 0, and the variable `a` becomes the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`. For example, if the initial value of `num` is 12345, the output state will be `num` = 0 and `a` = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
