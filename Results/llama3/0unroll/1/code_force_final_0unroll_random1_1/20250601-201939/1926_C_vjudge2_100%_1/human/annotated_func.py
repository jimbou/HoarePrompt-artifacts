#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: num is 0, a is the sum of the digits of the initial num
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the sum of the digits of the initial num, and since num is 0, a is also 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer. It takes an integer as input, iterates through each digit, and returns the total sum of these digits. The input integer is modified to 0 during the process. The function returns a single value, which is the sum of the digits of the original input integer.
