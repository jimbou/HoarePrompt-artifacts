Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number n.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer by iterating through each digit and adding it to the sum. The function modifies the input integer to 0 during the process, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The program also handles the time limit constraint of 0.5 seconds per test by using a pre-computation approach, which reduces the time complexity of the program.

Correctness: **True**
