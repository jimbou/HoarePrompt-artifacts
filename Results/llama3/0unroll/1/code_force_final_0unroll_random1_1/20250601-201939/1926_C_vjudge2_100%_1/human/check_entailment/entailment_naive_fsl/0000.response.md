Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores them in the list A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum for the given number n.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 200000. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit (num % 10) and adding it to the sum, and then removing the last digit (num = int(num / 10)).

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it should pass all test cases.
