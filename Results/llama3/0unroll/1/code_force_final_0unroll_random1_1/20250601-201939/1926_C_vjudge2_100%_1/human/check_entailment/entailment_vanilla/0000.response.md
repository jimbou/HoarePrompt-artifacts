Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of the numbers from 1 to 200000 in an array A.

2. The program defines a function func_1 that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. This function works correctly by using a while loop to extract each digit from the number and add it to the sum.

3. The program then uses a for loop to precompute the sum of the numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sum in the array A.

4. After precomputation, the program reads the number of test cases t and then for each test case, it reads the input number n and prints the corresponding value from the array A.

5. The program correctly handles the time limit constraint by using a precomputation approach, which allows it to generate the output for each test case in constant time.

6. The program also correctly handles the input constraints, as it only needs to handle numbers up to 200000, which is within the range of the precomputed array A.

7. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
