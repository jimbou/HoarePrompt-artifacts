#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer and cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable t remains unchanged, cases becomes an empty list, results is a list of pairs where each pair contains the number 25 and the list sequence, and sequence remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of pairs where each pair contains the number 25 and the list sequence, while the variable t remains unchanged, cases becomes an empty list, and sequence remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of pairs, where each pair contains the number 25 and a predefined sequence of powers of 2, for a given number of input cases. The function does not modify the input cases or any other external variables, and returns the generated list of pairs.
