Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

In this output state, the initial state variables `t` and `cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables: `results` and `sequence`. The `results` variable is initialized as an empty list, and the `sequence` variable is initialized as a list of 25 integers, each being a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.
