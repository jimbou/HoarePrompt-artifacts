Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` generates a list of pairs, where each pair contains the number 25 and a predefined sequence of powers of 2, for a given number of input cases. However, this solution does not meet the problem's requirements.

The problem requires finding a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, and for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. The given program does not ensure these conditions.

For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the program will output a sequence of 25 powers of 2, which does not guarantee that there is no subsequence with a sum of 7, and it does not ensure that there is a subsequence with a sum of every number from 1 to 10 except 7.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
