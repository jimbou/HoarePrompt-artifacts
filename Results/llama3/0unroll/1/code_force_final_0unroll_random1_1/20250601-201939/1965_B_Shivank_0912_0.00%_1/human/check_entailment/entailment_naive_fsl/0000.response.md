Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program always returns the same sequence of 25 numbers, regardless of the input values of n and k. This sequence does not satisfy the conditions of the problem for all possible inputs.

For example, consider the input n = 2 and k = 2. The program returns the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]. However, this sequence does not satisfy the condition that there is no subsequence with a sum of k = 2. In fact, the subsequence [2] has a sum of 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
