Reasoning:

1. The program defines a function `func_1()` which is called at the beginning of the program.
2. Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over it using a `for` loop.
3. For each test case, the program reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.
4. The program extracts the hour `h` from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
5. The program checks if the hour is '00' and if so, prints '12' as the hour for 12-hour format.
6. If the hour is not '00', the program checks if it is less than or equal to 12. If so, it prints the hour as is.
7. If the hour is greater than 12, the program subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, padding with a zero if necessary using the `0{}` format specifier.
8. The program prints the minutes (`s[2:]`) and the AM/PM indicator using a conditional expression (`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`).
9. The program repeats steps 3-8 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
