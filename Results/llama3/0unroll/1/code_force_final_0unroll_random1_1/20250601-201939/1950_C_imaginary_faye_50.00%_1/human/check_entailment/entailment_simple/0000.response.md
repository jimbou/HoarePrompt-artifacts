Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
3. It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
4. If the hour is 00, it prints 12 (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
5. If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it prints the hour as is (since it's already in 12-hour format).
6. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary (since hours in 12-hour format are numbered from 1 to 12).
7. It prints the minute part of the time (mm) as is, since it remains the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.
8. It prints either "AM" or "PM" depending on whether the hour is less than 12 (AM) or greater than or equal to 12 (PM).

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. The use of the `end=''` argument in the `print` function is also correct, as it allows the program to print the hour and minute parts without adding an extra newline character.

Correctness: **True**
