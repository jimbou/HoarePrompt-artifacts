Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the hour is between 13 and 23 correctly. When the hour is between 13 and 23, the program should subtract 12 from the hour and print 'PM', but it does not do so correctly. For example, when the input is '14:34', the program should output '02:34 PM', but it outputs '0{}'.format(int(h) - 12):34 PM' instead.

The correct code should be:

```
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        if h == 0:
            print('12', end='')
        elif h <= 12:
            print(s[:2], end='')
        else:
            print('{:02d}'.format(h - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][h >= 12])
```

This code correctly handles the case when the hour is between 13 and 23 by subtracting 12 from the hour and printing 'PM'. It also uses the '{:02d}' format specifier to ensure that the hour is always printed with two digits.
