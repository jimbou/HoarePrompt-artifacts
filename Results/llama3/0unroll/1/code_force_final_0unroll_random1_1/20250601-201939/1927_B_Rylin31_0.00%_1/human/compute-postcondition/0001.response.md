Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the length of the lost string, and the second line contains a list of integers representing the trace of the string. It then constructs a string by iterating over the reversed list of integers, appending a character to the result string based on the count of each integer in the reversed list. The character is determined by the count of the integer minus one, which corresponds to a letter in the alphabet. The function prints the resulting string for each test case.**
