stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of the lost string. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) — the trace of the string.
