Output State: **The output state is a string of characters, where each character is the (count of the corresponding number in the reversed array - 1)th letter of the alphabet. The string is constructed by iterating over the reversed array and appending the corresponding character to the result string. The output state is the result string after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
