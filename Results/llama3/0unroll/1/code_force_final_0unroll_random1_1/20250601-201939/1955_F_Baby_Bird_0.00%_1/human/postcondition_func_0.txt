This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. For each line, it checks if the first three integers are odd, and if so, adds 1 to the sum of all four integers divided by 2. If the first three integers are not all odd, it simply calculates the sum of all four integers divided by 2. The function then prints the result of this calculation for each input line.
