Output State: **The output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input line. The calculation involves checking if the first three numbers in the line are odd (i.e., their remainder when divided by 2 is 1), and if so, adding 1 to the sum of the numbers in the line divided by 2. If the first three numbers are not all odd, the result is simply the sum of the numbers in the line divided by 2.**
