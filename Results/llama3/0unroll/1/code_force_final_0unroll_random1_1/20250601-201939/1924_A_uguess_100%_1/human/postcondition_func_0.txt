This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the result for each case. It checks if a given string can be extended to a certain length by appending specific characters, and if so, prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by the extended string. The function iterates through the input test cases, processing each one independently, and outputs the results in the specified format.
