Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, which represent the length of the strings, the number of lowercase English alphabets, and the length of the string s, respectively.
3. It then reads the string s.
4. The program initializes a counter cnt to 0, a variable cur to 0, and an empty string ans.
5. It then iterates over each character ss in the string s.
6. For each character ss, it calculates the ASCII value of ss minus the ASCII value of 'a' to get the index of the character in the alphabet (0-indexed). This value is stored in cur_ss.
7. If the bit corresponding to cur_ss is not set in the binary representation of cur, it sets the bit and increments cur.
8. If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, which represents the binary number with all bits set from 0 to k-1, it increments the counter cnt, resets cur to 0, and appends the current character ss to the string ans.
9. After iterating over the entire string s, if the counter cnt is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.
10. If cnt is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string tmp by finding the first alphabet character that is not present in the binary representation of cur. It then appends tmp to ans and fills the rest of the string with 'a's to make its length equal to n. Finally, it prints the constructed string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
