Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will not correctly identify all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abbaa"`, the program will not correctly identify the string "aa" as a possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, because the character "a" is not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the character `ss` is in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets before processing it. If `ss` is not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, the program should skip it.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            if ord(ss) - ord('a') < k:  # Check if ss is in the first k lowercase English alphabets
                cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
                if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                    cur += 1 << cur_ss
                if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                    cnt += 1
                    cur = 0
                    ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
```
With this correction, the program should work correctly for all possible inputs.
