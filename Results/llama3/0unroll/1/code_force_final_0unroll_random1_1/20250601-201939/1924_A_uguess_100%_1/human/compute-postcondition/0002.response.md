Output State: **The loop has executed t times, and for each execution, it has processed a test case from the input. The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, followed by a string if the answer is 'NO'. The string will be the original string s with additional characters appended to it to make its length equal to n. The additional characters will be the first character of the alphabet that is not present in the current substring of s, followed by 'a's. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.**
