The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^5) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of a line with three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line with a string s of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of a line with three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line with a string s of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
