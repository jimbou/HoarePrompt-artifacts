Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.
2.  The program initializes variables `cnt` to 0, `cur` to 0, and an empty string `ans`.
3.  The program then iterates through the string `s`. For each character `ss` in `s`, it calculates the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a' to get the index `cur_ss` of the character in the alphabet.
4.  If the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` is 0, it sets the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` to 1. This effectively keeps track of the characters in `s` that have been seen so far.
5.  If `cur` becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, which means all `k` characters have been seen, it increments `cnt` by 1, resets `cur` to 0, and appends the current character `ss` to `ans`.
6.  After iterating through the entire string `s`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a string.
7.  The string is constructed by finding the first character in the alphabet that has not been seen in the current substring of `s` (i.e., the first character `i` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0), appending it to `ans`, and then appending 'a's to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.

The program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. If not, it correctly constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Correctness: **True**
