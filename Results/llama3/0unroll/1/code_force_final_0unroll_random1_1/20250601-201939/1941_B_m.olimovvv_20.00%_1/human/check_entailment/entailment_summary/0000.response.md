Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The key insight here is that the operation can only decrease the elements of the array, and it can only decrease the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the parity of the elements at indices 1 and n-1 (0-indexed) must be the same, and the difference between the elements at indices 1 and 2, and n-2 and n-1 must be 2.

The program checks these conditions and prints 'YES' if they are met, and 'NO' otherwise. This is correct because if these conditions are not met, it's impossible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Correctness: **True**
