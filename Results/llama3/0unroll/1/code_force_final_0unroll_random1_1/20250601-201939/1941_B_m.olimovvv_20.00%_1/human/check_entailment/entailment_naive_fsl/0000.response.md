Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. The program only checks the first and last elements of the array, but it does not consider the rest of the elements.

A counterexample is the input:

    4
    1 2 3 4

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The correct implementation should check all elements of the array and verify that the operations can be applied to make all elements equal to zero.
