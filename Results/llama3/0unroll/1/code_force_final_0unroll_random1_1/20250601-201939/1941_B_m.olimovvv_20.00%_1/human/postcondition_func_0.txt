The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n' followed by 'n' integers. It then checks if the first and last numbers in the sequence have certain properties (specifically, if they are odd and the preceding or succeeding number is not 2 more than them). Based on this check, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each test case, indicating whether the sequence meets the specified conditions.
