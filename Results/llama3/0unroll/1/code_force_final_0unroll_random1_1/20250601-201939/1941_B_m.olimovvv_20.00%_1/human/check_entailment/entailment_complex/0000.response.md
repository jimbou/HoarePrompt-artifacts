Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that the parity of the first and last elements of the array determines whether it's possible to make all elements zero. If the first element is odd, then the second element must be 2 more than the first element, and similarly, if the last element is odd, then the second last element must be 2 more than the last element. This is because the operation can only decrease the elements by 1 or 2, and the parity of the elements must be preserved.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'YES' if they are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
