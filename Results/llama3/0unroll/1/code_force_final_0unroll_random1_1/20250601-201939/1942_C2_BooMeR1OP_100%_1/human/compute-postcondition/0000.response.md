Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The rest of the input remains unchanged, with `t` test cases still to be processed. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` within their respective ranges, and the second line containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
