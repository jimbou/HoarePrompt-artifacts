Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program first calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie, and then it tries to add more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

The program handles the cases where the gaps between the chosen vertices are odd or even separately, which is correct because the number of triangles that can be formed in these cases is different. The program also correctly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed in each gap and updates the remaining number of vertices that can be chosen.

The program also handles the case where the number of vertices that can be chosen is less than the number of gaps, which is correct because in this case, the program should choose the vertices that will result in the maximum number of triangles.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
