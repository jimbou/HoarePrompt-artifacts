Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. 

Here's why:

- The program first calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This represents the time at which the maximum number of fireworks can be seen in the sky.

- It then calculates the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be seen at time `mn` by doing integer division of `mn` by `a`. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.

- Similarly, it calculates the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be seen at time `mn` by doing integer division of `mn` by `b`.

- If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it adds 1 to the result. This is because in this case, there will be one more firework visible in the sky at time `mn`, which is the firework launched at time 0.

- Finally, it prints the total number of fireworks that can be seen at time `mn`, which is the sum of the number of fireworks from the first and second installations.

Correctness: **True**
