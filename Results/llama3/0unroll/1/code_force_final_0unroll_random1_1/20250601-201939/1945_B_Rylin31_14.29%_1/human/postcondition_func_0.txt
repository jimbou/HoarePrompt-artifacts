This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression mn // a + mn // b, where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b and neither a nor b is 1, it adds 1 to the result. The function outputs the calculated results for each test case, one per line.
