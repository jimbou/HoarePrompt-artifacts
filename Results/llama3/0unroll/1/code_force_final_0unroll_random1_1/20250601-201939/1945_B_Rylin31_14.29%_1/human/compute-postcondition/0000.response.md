The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
