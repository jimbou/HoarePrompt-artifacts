Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's why:

* The program first calculates the minimum time `mn` it takes for a firework to be visible in the sky, which is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
* It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and if `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means that the fireworks launched by both installations will be visible for at least one minute at the same time. In this case, the program adds 1 to the total count of visible fireworks.
* Otherwise, the program simply calculates the total count of visible fireworks by dividing `mn` by `a` and `b` and adding the results.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that fireworks launched by the same installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time if the time between launches is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky. It also correctly handles the case where `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, in which case the fireworks launched by both installations will be visible for at least one minute at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
