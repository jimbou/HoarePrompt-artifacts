Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string s and prints their sum. The program follows the problem description and the execution summary accurately describes its behavior.

The program uses the count() method of the string class to count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string s. This method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. The program then prints the sum of these counts, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program handles the input correctly, reading the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself. It also produces the correct output, printing the sum of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
