Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string s and prints their sum. This is in line with the problem description, which requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program does not attempt to remove characters or modify the string in any way, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings and prints the result.

The program also handles the input correctly, reading an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a string s. The input values of t and the strings s remain unchanged, as required.

The output of the program is also correct, producing t lines of output, each containing the sum of 'map' and 'pie' occurrences for the corresponding test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
