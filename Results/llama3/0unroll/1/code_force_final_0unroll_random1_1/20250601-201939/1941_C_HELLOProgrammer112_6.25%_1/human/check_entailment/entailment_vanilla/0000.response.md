Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The provided program uses the count() method to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string. It then prints the sum of these counts, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that deleting a character can affect multiple substrings. For example, if the string contains the substring "mapie", deleting the 'p' would remove both "map" and "pie" substrings, but the program would count this as two separate deletions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
