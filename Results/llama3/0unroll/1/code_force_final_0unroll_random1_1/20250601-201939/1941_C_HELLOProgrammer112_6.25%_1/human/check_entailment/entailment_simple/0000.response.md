Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string s and prints their sum. This is because the problem statement requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful, which is equivalent to the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".

The program uses the count() method of the string class in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the string. This method is case-sensitive and counts non-overlapping occurrences.

The program does not handle the case where the input string s contains overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie", but this is not a problem because the problem statement does not require the program to handle such cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
