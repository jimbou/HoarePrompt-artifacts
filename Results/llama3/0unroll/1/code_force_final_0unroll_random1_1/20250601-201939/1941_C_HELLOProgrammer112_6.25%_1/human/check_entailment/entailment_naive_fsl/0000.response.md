Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings, but in reality, it should be counted as one, because removing one character can make the string beautiful.

In the given program, the count function is used to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, which can lead to incorrect results when there are overlapping substrings. A correct solution would need to handle these cases properly.
