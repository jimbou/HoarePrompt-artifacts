Correctness: **False**

Reasoning: 

The provided program is designed to maximize the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation on sub-ranges of the array. However, upon analyzing the functions, it becomes apparent that the program does not correctly achieve this goal.

Function 1 (`func_1`) modifies a list of non-negative integers by setting all elements within a specified range to the length of that range, but only if the first element of that range does not already match the range length. This function is used to perform the operation described in the problem statement.

Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list and returns the sum along with an empty list of operations and its length (which is 0). This function does not modify the input list and does not perform any operations.

Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`) is a recursive function that modifies a list of non-negative integers by either replacing a sub-range with a uniform value or recursively maximizing the sum of sub-ranges. However, this function is not correctly implemented to achieve the maximum sum.

Function 4 (`func_3`) reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It calls `func_2` with the input list, which returns the sum and an empty list of operations.

The main issue with the program is that `func_2` does not correctly maximize the sum of the elements in the array. It simply calculates the sum of the input list without performing any operations to maximize it. Additionally, `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correctly implemented to achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and the correctness is **False**.
