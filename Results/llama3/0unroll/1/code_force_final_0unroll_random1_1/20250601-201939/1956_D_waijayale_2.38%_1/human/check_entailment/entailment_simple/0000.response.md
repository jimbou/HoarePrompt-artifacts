Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we need to maximize the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set {a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}, and simultaneously setting a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x.

The program uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It first checks if the sum of the elements in the current range [l, r] is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). If it is, it calls function func_1 to perform the operation and update the array. If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum value in the range and its position, and recursively calls itself on the sub-ranges [l, pos - 1] and [pos + 1, r].

The program also keeps track of the operations performed and their parameters (l, r) in the ops list.

The main function func_2 initializes the ops list, calls the recursive function, and returns the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the ops list.

The input function reads the input from stdin, calls func_2, and prints the result.

Based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments, the program seems to be correct. It correctly implements the recursive approach to maximize the sum of elements in the array and keeps track of the operations performed.

Correctness: **True**
