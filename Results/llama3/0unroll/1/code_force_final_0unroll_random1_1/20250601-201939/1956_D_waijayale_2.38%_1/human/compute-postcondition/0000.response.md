Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is an integer, m is an integer, ops is an integer, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Since the list contains non-negative integers, `a` becomes a list of non-negative integers. The third line calls the function `func_2` with `a` as an argument and assigns the returned values to `s`, `m`, and `ops`. Since the function returns three integers, `s`, `m`, and `ops` become integers. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.
