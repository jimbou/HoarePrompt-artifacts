Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. 

func_1 is a recursive function that takes a list of non-negative integers a, two integers l and r, and a list of tuples ops as input. It modifies the list a by setting all elements within a specified range (l to r) to the length of that range (r - l + 1), but only if the first element of that range does not already match the range length. It also keeps track of the operations performed by appending tuples representing the modified ranges to the list ops.

func_2 calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list a and returns the sum along with an empty list ops and its length (which is 0). However, it does not perform any operations that are stored in the ops list.

func_3 modifies a list of non-negative integers by either replacing a sub-range with a uniform value or recursively maximizing the sum of sub-ranges.

func_4 reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console.

However, there are several issues with the program. 

Firstly, func_2 does not perform any operations and returns an empty list ops. This means that the program does not actually perform the operation of maximizing the sum of elements in the array.

Secondly, func_3 does not correctly implement the operation of maximizing the sum of elements in the array. It only replaces a sub-range with a uniform value or recursively maximizes the sum of sub-ranges, but it does not consider the case where the sum of the elements in the sub-range is already greater than the length of the sub-range squared.

Lastly, func_4 does not correctly print the results to the console. It only prints the sum of the elements in the array and the length of the ops list, but it does not print the actual operations performed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
