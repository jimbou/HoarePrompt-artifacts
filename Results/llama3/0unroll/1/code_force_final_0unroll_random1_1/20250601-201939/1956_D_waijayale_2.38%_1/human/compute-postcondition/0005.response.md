Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts two inputs: a positive integer 'n' representing the length of a list, and a space-separated list of non-negative integers 'a' of length 'n'. The function then calls another function 'func_2' with 'a' as an argument, which returns three values: 's', 'm', and 'ops'. The function prints 's' and 'm' to the console, followed by a series of pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of 'l + 1' and 'r + 1', derived from the 'ops' list. The function does not modify the input values or the standard input state.**
