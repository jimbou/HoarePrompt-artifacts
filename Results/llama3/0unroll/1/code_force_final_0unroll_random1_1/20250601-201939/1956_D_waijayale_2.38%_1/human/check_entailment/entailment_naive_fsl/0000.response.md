Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not sufficient to determine whether the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` can be maximized by setting all elements to `r - l + 1`.

Consider the case where the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function will incorrectly determine that the sum of the elements in the range `[0, 4]` can be maximized by setting all elements to `5`, when in fact the maximum sum can be achieved by setting the elements in the range `[0, 2]` to `3` and the elements in the range `[3, 4]` to `5`.

This is just one example where the program does not work correctly. There may be other cases where the program fails to produce the correct output.
