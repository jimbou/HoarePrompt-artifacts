Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and ops is a list of tuples of integers.

            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: The value of `a` has been modified such that all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are now equal to `r - l + 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

    #State: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l < len(a), `r` is an integer such that l < r < len(a), `ops` is a list of tuples of integers. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, then all elements from index `l + 1` to `r` (inclusive) in `a` are now equal to `r - l`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `l`, `r`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of non-negative integers (`a`) by setting all elements within a specified range (`l` to `r`) to the length of that range (`r - l + 1`), but only if the first element of that range does not already match the range length. It also keeps track of the operations performed by appending tuples representing the modified ranges to a list (`ops`). The function recursively processes the list, starting from the first element of the specified range and moving forward. If the first element of the range is not equal to the range length, it updates the range in the list and records the operation. The function returns no value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers.

    #The program returns the sum of all non-negative integers in list 'a', the length of the empty list 'ops' which is 0, and the empty list 'ops'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list 'a' and returns the sum along with an empty list 'ops' and its length (which is 0). The function does not modify the input list 'a' and does not perform any operations that are stored in the 'ops' list. The purpose of the function is to provide the total sum of non-negative integers in the list 'a'.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and a is a list of non-negative integers.
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])

        func_1(a, l, r, ops)

If pos is not equal to l, the function recursive_maximize_sum has been called with arguments l and pos - 1. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.

If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and previously it has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to (`r` - `l` + 1) * (`r` - `l` + 1), all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are now equal to `r - l + 1`, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `s` is greater than (`r` - `l` + 1) * (`r` - `l` + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and previously it has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.

#Overall this is what the function does:Modifies a list of non-negative integers by either replacing a sub-range with a uniform value or recursively maximizing the sum of sub-ranges.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer and then a space-separated list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains non-negative integers.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s (which is an integer), m (which is an integer)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the same as the initial state, with the values of l and r changed in each iteration of the loop. In each iteration, l and r are assigned the next pair of values from the ops list. The values of n, a, s, m, and stdin remain unchanged. The output of the loop is a series of pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of l + 1 and r + 1, printed to the console.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It accepts two inputs: a positive integer 'n' representing the length of a list, and a space-separated list of non-negative integers 'a' of length 'n'. The function then calls another function 'func_2' with 'a' as an argument, which returns three values: 's', 'm', and 'ops'. The function prints 's' and 'm' to the console, followed by a series of pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of 'l + 1' and 'r + 1', derived from the 'ops' list. The function does not modify the input values or the standard input state.
