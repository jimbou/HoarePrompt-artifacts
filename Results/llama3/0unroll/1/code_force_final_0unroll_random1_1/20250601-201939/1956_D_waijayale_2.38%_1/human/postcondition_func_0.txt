This function modifies a list of non-negative integers (`a`) by setting all elements within a specified range (`l` to `r`) to the length of that range (`r - l + 1`), but only if the first element of that range does not already match the range length. It also keeps track of the operations performed by appending tuples representing the modified ranges to a list (`ops`). The function recursively processes the list, starting from the first element of the specified range and moving forward. If the first element of the range is not equal to the range length, it updates the range in the list and records the operation. The function returns no value.
