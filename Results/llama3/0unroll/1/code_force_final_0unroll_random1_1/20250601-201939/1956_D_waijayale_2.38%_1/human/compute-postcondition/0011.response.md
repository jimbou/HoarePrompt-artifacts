Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and `s` is greater than (`r` - `l` + 1) * (`r` - `l` + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and previously it has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and previously it was called with `l` and `pos - 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain the same as in the initial state. The function call stack has been updated to reflect the new call.
