Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of four functions:

1. `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`: This function is used to perform the operation on the subarray `a[l:r+1]`. It first checks if `l == r`, and if so, it checks if `a[l] != 0`. If `a[l] != 0`, it appends `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets `a[l] = 0`. Then, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. If `a[l] != r - l + 1`, it appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets `a[i] = r - l + 1` for all `i` in `range(l, r + 1)`, and recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`.

2. `func_2(a)`: This function is used to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a`. It first initializes `n = len(a)` and `ops = []`. Then, it calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` and returns `(sum(a), len(ops), ops)`.

3. `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`: This function is used to recursively maximize the sum of the elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]`. It first calculates `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`. If `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`, appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets `a[i] = r - l + 1` for all `i` in `range(l, r + 1)`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r+1]` and its position `pos`. If `pos != l`, it recursively calls itself with `l` and `pos - 1`. If `pos != r`, it recursively calls itself with `pos + 1` and `r`.

4. `func_3()`: This function is used to read the input and call `func_2(a)`. It reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself, calls `func_2(a)`, and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the operation and the recursive approach to maximize the sum of the elements in the array. The `func_1` function correctly performs the operation on the subarray, and the `recursive_maximize_sum` function correctly recursively maximizes the sum of the elements in the subarray. The `func_2` function correctly calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the result, and the `func_3` function correctly reads the input and calls `func_2`.

Correctness: **True**
