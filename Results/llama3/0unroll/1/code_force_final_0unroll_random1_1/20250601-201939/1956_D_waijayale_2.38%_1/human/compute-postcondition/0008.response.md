Output State: **`l` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, and the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the left boundary `l` and the index of the maximum value `mx` minus one, and all other variables remain unchanged. The function call does not change the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`, but it may have side effects or return values that are not captured in this output state.
