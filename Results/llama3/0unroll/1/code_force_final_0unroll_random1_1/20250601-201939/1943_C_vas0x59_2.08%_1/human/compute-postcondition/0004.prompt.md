Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list u2vs remains unchanged, still containing n lists, each representing an adjacency list of a graph. The variable d now holds the shortest distance from node a to all other nodes in the graph. The variable a holds the node with the maximum shortest distance from node 0. The variable previous holds the previous node in the shortest path from node a to all other nodes. The variable b holds the node with the maximum shortest distance from node a. The variable path_ba is a list containing only node b.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
