Output State: **n is an integer, u2vs is a list of n empty lists, stdin contains 1 fewer input than initially**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1. The second line creates a list of `n` empty lists and assigns it to `u2vs`. The value of `n` is used to determine the number of empty lists in `u2vs`. No other variables are affected.
