#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin to construct an adjacency list representing a graph, finds the shortest path between two nodes in the graph, and then generates a list of operations based on the length of the path. If the path length is odd, the operations involve a single node at the middle index of the path and integers from 0 to the middle index. If the path length is even, the operations involve two nodes at the middle indices of the path and integers from 1 to the second last index with a step of 2. The function then prints the number of operations and each operation as a string in the format "{node + 1} {index}". The function returns None.
