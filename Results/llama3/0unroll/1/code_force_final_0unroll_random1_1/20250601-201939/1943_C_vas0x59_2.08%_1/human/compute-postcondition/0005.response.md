Output State: **The variable `path_ba` still contains the shortest path from node a to node b, and a new variable `ops` has been initialized as an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `path_ba` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The code only introduces a new variable `ops` and initializes it as an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `path_ba` and the newly introduced variable `ops` with its initial value.
