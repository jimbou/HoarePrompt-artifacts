Output State: **The variable path_ba contains the shortest path from node a to node b.**

In this output state, the variable path_ba has been updated to contain the shortest path from node a to node b. This path is constructed by iteratively appending the previous node in the shortest path from node a to the current node (path_ba[-1]) until the starting node (node a) is reached, which is indicated by the value -1 in the previous array. The loop terminates when the starting node is reached, and the final path_ba contains the shortest path from node a to node b.
