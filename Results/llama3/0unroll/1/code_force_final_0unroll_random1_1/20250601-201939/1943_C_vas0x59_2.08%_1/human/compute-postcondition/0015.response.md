The code prints the length of the list `ops`. The length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples with a node at index `ci` in `path_ba` and an integer from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), where `ci` is half of the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of indices (c1, i) and (c2, i) for each i in the range from 1 to len(path_ba) - c1 with a step of 2.

Output: **the length of ops (where ops is a list of tuples based on the length of path_ba)**
