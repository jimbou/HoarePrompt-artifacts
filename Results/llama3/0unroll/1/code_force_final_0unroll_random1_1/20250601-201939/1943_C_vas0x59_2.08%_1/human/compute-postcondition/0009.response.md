Output State: The variable `path_ba` still contains the shortest path from node a to node b, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the node at index `ci` in `path_ba` and an integer from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), `ci` is an integer equal to half of the length of `path_ba`, and `c` is the node at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
