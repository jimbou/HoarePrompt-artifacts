Postcondition: **The variable `path_ba` still contains the shortest path from node a to node b. The variable `ops` is a list of tuples. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, each tuple in `ops` contains the node at index `ci` in `path_ba` and an integer from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), where `ci` is an integer equal to half of the length of `path_ba`, and `c` is the node at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, each tuple in `ops` contains a pair of indices (c1, i) and (c2, i) for each i in the range from 1 to len(path_ba) - c1 with a step of 2, where c2 is half the length of path_ba, and c1 is one less than c2.**
