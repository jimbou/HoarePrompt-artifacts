The `print` statement will print a sequence of strings, each representing a tuple in the `ops` list. The strings are formatted as follows: for each tuple `(node, index)` in `ops`, the string will be in the format `{node + 1} {index}`, where `node` is the node at the specified index in the `path_ba` list, and `index` is the integer value from the tuple.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, each tuple in `ops` contains the node at index `ci` in `path_ba` and an integer from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), where `ci` is an integer equal to half of the length of `path_ba`. In this case, the printed strings will represent the node at index `ci` and its corresponding integer value.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, each tuple in `ops` contains a pair of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `c1` is one less than `c2`. In this case, the printed strings will represent the nodes at indices `c1` and `c2` and their corresponding integer values.

The `sep='\n'` argument in the `print` function means that each string will be printed on a new line.

Output: **A sequence of strings, each representing a tuple in the ops list, formatted as {node + 1} {index}, where node is the node at the specified index in the path_ba list, and index is the integer value from the tuple, with each string printed on a new line**
