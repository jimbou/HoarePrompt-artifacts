This function calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation for each input pair (n, k), where n and k are integers. For each pair, if k is less than or equal to half of n, it prints 2*k - 1. Otherwise, it calculates the result using a while loop and prints 2^(i - 1) * (2*f - 1), where i is the number of iterations and f is the difference between k and the sum of the first i - 1 terms of a sequence. The function processes multiple input pairs and prints the results in a list.
