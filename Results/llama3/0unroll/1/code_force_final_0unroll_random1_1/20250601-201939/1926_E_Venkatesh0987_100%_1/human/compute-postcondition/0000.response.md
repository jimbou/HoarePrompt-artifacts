Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair (n, k). The list has a length of t, where t is the number of input pairs. Each integer in the list is either 2*k - 1 (if k <= (n + 1) // 2) or 2^(i - 1) * (2*f - 1) (if k > (n + 1) // 2), where i is the number of iterations of the while loop and f is the difference between k and the sum of the first i - 1 terms of the sequence h + 1 // 2.**
