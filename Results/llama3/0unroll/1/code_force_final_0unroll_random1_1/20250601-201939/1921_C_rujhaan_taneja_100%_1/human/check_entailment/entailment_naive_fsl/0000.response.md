Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates an array `array2` to store the minimum charge consumption between each pair of messages.
3. The program correctly calculates the minimum charge consumption between each pair of messages by comparing the time difference between the messages with `b / a`. If the time difference is less than `b / a`, it means that turning the phone off and on would consume more charge than keeping it on, so it appends the charge consumption for keeping the phone on to `array2`. Otherwise, it appends the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on to `array2`.
4. The program correctly calculates the total charge consumption by summing up the charge consumption in `array2` and adding the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on for the remaining messages.
5. Finally, the program correctly compares the total charge consumption with the initial phone charge `f` and prints "Yes" if the total charge consumption is less than `f`, and "No" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the time difference between messages is less than `b / a` or greater than or equal to `b / a`. Therefore, the program is correct.
