Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, one for each test case, indicating whether the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and b is less than f. The values of test_cases, stdin, n, f, a, b, and arr will remain unchanged.**
