Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers. The integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.**

In this output state, `test_cases` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The values of the other variables are not affected.
