Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains four space-separated integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n space-separated integers.

2. The program correctly initializes variables n, f, a, and b from the input.

3. The program correctly creates an array arr from the second line of the input.

4. The program correctly calculates the values to be appended to array2. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in arr is less than b/a, it appends the product of the difference and a to array2. Otherwise, it appends b to array2.

5. The program correctly calculates the sum of the values in array2 and adds the product of the number of remaining elements and b.

6. The program correctly checks if the calculated sum is less than f and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

7. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between the current element and the previous element in arr is less than b/a, in which case it appends the product of the difference and a to array2.

8. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between the current element and the previous element in arr is greater than or equal to b/a, in which case it appends b to array2.

Correctness: **True**
