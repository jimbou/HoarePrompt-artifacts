Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers in ascending order.
2.  It correctly initializes variables n, f, a, and b from the input values.
3.  The program then calculates a new array (array2) by iterating over the input array. For each element, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous one (or the current element if it's the first one) is less than b/a. If it is, it appends the product of the difference and 'a' to array2.
4.  After calculating array2, the program checks if the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements (n - len(array2)) and 'b' is less than 'f'. If it is, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
5.  The program does not modify the input values and only prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
