Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers in ascending order. For each test case, it calculates a new array (array2) by multiplying the difference between consecutive integers in the input array by 'a' if the difference is less than 'b/a'. If the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and 'b' is less than 'f', it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify the input values and only prints the result for each test case.**
