#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers. The integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, one for each test case, indicating whether the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and b is less than f. The values of test_cases, stdin, n, f, a, b, and arr will remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers in ascending order. For each test case, it calculates a new array (array2) by multiplying the difference between consecutive integers in the input array by 'a' if the difference is less than 'b/a'. If the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and 'b' is less than 'f', it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify the input values and only prints the result for each test case.
