Output State: **`n` and `k` are returned by `func_4()`**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_4()`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are no longer valid. The function `func_4()` is assumed to return two integer values, which are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The output state does not provide any information about the specific values returned by `func_4()`, as it depends on the implementation of the function.
