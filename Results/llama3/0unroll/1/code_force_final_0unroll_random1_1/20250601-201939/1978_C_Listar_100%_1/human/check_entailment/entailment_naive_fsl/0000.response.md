Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when `k` is odd. In the `func_4` function, it checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` immediately, which means it does not attempt to find a permutation for odd `k` values. However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that `k` must be even, and it is possible to construct permutations with odd Manhattan values. For example, the permutation `[2, 1, 3]` has a Manhattan value of 1, which is odd.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases, specifically the case when `k` is odd.
