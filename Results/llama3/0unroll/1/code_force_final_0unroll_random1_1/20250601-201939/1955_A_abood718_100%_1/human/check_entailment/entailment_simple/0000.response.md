Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, and for each case, it checks the conditions to determine the minimum cost.

The conditions are as follows:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), then the minimum cost is the price of n yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, then the minimum cost is the price of A/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, then the minimum cost is the price of (A-1)/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price plus the price of one yogurt at the regular price (X * C + B), where X is the integer division of A by 2.

The program correctly implements these conditions and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
