Reasoning:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where `n` is the number of yogurts to buy, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.
3. The program then checks three conditions:
   - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the price of two yogurts on promotion (`b`), it prints the total cost as `n * a`.
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is even, it prints the total cost as `n * b / 2`, which is equivalent to buying `n / 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, it calculates the total cost by buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`X * C`) and adding the price of one yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
4. The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
