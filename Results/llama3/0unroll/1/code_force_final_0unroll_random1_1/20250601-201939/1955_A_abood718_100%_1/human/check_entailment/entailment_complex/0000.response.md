Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

The program first reads the number of test cases t from the input. Then, for each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, representing the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

The program then applies the following logic to calculate the minimum cost:

1. If 2a is less than b, it means that buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. In this case, the program prints the product of n and a.

2. If n is even, it means that Maxim can buy all the yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program prints the product of n and b divided by 2.

3. If n is odd, it means that Maxim cannot buy all the yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n divided by 2, rounded down), multiplies it by b, and adds the price of one yogurt (a).

The program outputs the calculated result for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store.

Correctness: **True**
