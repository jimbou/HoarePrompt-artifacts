Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers three cases:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2*B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it calculates the total cost as A*B.
2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the total cost as A*C/2, since Maxim can buy all yogurts at the promotion price.
3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the total cost as X*C + B, where X is the number of pairs of yogurts Maxim can buy at the promotion price (A//2), and B is the price of the remaining yogurt.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
