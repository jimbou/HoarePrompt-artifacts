Functionality: **This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each inner list of the input list `test_cases` and returns a list of these LCMs. It iterates through each inner list, updating the current year to be the next multiple of each integer in the list, and appends the final current year (the LCM) to the results list. The function takes a list of lists of positive integers as input and returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the LCM of the corresponding inner list.**
