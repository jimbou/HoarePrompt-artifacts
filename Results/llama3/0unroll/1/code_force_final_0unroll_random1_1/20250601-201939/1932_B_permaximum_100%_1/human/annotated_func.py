#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer n, and the rest of the elements are n positive integers.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer n, and the rest of the elements are n positive integers, `results` is a list of positive integers, where each integer is the least common multiple of the integers in the corresponding inner list in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the least common multiple of the integers in the corresponding inner list in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each inner list of the input list `test_cases` and returns a list of these LCMs. It iterates through each inner list, updating the current year to be the next multiple of each integer in the list, and appends the final current year (the LCM) to the results list. The function takes a list of lists of positive integers as input and returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the LCM of the corresponding inner list.
