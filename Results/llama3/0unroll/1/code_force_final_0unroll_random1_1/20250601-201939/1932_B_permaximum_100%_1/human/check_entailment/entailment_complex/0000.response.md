Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all n signs will occur. The program iterates through each sign's periodicity and updates the current year to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program also handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, in which case it simply adds the periodicity to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
