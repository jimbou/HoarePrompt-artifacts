Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. If the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity, it simply adds the periodicity to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity.
* When the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity.
* When the sign's periodicity is 1 (i.e., the sign occurs every year).
* When the sign's periodicity is greater than 1.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list of sign periodicities is empty, in which case it returns 0.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
