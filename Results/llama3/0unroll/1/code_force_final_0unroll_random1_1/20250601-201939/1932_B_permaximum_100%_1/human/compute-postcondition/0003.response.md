Output State: **The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the least common multiple of the integers in the corresponding inner list in `test_cases`.**

In this output state, the returned list `results` contains the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each inner list of `test_cases`. For example, if `test_cases` is `[[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]`, the returned `results` would be `[12, 210, 2520]`, where 12 is the LCM of 2, 3, and 4, 210 is the LCM of 5, 6, and 7, and 2520 is the LCM of 8, 9, and 10.
