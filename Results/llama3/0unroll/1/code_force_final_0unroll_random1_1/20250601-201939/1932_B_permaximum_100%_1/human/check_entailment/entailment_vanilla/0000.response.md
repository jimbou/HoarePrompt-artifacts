Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and stores it in the variable `t`.

2. It then reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` for each test case, and stores them in the `test_cases` list.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and the `test_cases` list as input.

4. Inside the `func_1` function, it iterates over each test case. For each test case, it initializes a variable `current_year` to 0.

5. It then iterates over the periodicities of the signs `a`. For each periodicity `ai`, it checks if the `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. If it is, it sets the `next_year` to `current_year + ai`. If it's not, it calculates the `next_year` as the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.

6. It then updates the `current_year` to the `next_year`.

7. After iterating over all the periodicities, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.

8. Finally, it returns the `results` list.

9. The program then calls the `func_1` function with the `t` and `test_cases` as arguments, and stores the results in the `results` variable.

10. It then prints each result in the `results` list.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
