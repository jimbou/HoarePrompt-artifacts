Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer n, and the rest of the elements are n positive integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code introduces a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
