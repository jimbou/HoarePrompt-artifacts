Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic used to calculate the next year after each sign is correct. If the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the next year is the current year plus the periodicity. Otherwise, the next year is the first multiple of the periodicity greater than the current year.

The program also correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, in which case the next year is the current year plus the periodicity.

The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the year in which the n-th sign will occur for the corresponding test case.

Correctness: **True**
