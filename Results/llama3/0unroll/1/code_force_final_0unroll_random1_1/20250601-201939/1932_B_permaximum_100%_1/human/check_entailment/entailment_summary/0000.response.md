Reasoning:

The provided program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the list of sign periodicities. For each periodicity, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by finding the next multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year. This is done by checking if the current year is a multiple of the periodicity, and if not, calculating the next multiple by adding the periodicity to the current year. The program then updates the current year to be the next year when the sign will occur.

The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the periodicity, in which case it simply adds the periodicity to the current year to get the next year when the sign will occur. It also correctly handles the case where the current year is not a multiple of the periodicity, in which case it calculates the next multiple by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity.

The program's use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the current year is a multiple of the periodicity is efficient and accurate. The program's use of integer division (`//`) to calculate the next multiple of the periodicity is also efficient and accurate.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
