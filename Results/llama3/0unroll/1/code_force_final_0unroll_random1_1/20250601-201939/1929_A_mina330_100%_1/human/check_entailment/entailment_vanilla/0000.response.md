Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the last and first elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, which maximizes the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
