Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly reads the input, sorts the array, and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. The output state matches the expected output format, which contains the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
