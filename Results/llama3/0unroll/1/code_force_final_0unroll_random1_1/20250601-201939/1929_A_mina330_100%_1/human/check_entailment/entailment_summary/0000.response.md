Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

The program is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements is maximized when the smallest element is subtracted from the largest element, the second smallest element is subtracted from the second largest element, and so on.

By sorting the array, the program ensures that the smallest element is subtracted from the largest element, resulting in the maximum possible beauty. The program then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
