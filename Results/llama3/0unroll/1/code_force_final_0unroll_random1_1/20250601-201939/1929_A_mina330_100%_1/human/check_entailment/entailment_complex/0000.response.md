Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements such that the smallest element is first and the largest element is last. This is because the beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, we maximize the differences.

The program correctly implements this insight by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
