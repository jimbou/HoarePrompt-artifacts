Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the difference between the last element (maximum value) and the first element (minimum value). This is the maximum possible beauty of the array, as the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. By sorting the array, the program ensures that the differences are maximized, resulting in the maximum possible beauty.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
* When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between them.
* When there are multiple elements, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible beauty by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
