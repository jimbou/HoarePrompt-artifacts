To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided problem description.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array `a` that can be obtained after adding some permutation to the array `a`. This means we need to find the maximum frequency of any number in the array after applying a permutation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) for input handling and basic operations. However, for the given problem, we are interested in functions that directly contribute to solving the problem, such as sorting the array and finding the maximum frequency after applying a permutation.
   - The program does not explicitly show the implementation of the main logic to solve the problem. It seems to be missing the critical part where it calculates the maximum frequency after applying permutations.

3. **Expected Solution Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then iterating through it to find the maximum span of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. This typically involves using a sliding window approach or a similar method to efficiently find the maximum frequency achievable.
   - The use of `bisect_left` from the `bisect` module is hinted at but not utilized in the provided code snippet. This function could be useful in determining how many elements can be made equal to a certain value by adding a permutation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the provided code does not directly address the problem's requirement to find the maximum frequency after applying a permutation, it appears incomplete for the task at hand.
   - Without the actual implementation of the problem-solving logic, the program cannot be deemed correct for the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**
