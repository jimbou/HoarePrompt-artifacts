Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. The program uses a combination of sorting, set operations, and binary search to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and the length of the array for each test case using `func_1()`. This is correct as it reads the input as specified in the problem.

2. The program then reads the array elements using `func_3()` and sorts them in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. This is correct as it prepares the input array for further processing.

3. The program then uses a set to remove duplicate elements from the sorted array. This is correct as it ensures that each element in the array is unique.

4. The program then iterates over the unique elements in the array and uses binary search (`bisect_left()`) to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal to the current element by adding a permutation. This is correct as it uses an efficient algorithm to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

5. The program then updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum number of elements found in the previous step. This is correct as it keeps track of the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

6. Finally, the program prints the answer for each test case. This is correct as it outputs the result as specified in the problem.

Overall, the program correctly implements the algorithm to solve the problem, and its functions work together to produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
