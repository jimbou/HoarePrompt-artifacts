Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding some permutation to the array. However, the provided code does not implement any logic to solve this problem. It only contains some general utility functions for input and sorting, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

For example, if we input the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 2, because we can add the permutation [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] to get the array [3, 5, 7, 9, 6], which has two elements equal to 6. However, the provided code does not produce this output.

To solve this problem, we need to implement a logic that finds the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. This can be done by sorting the array and then iterating over it to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
