#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a list of strings from the input, where each string is separated by a space.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing this list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of characters
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of characters from standard input and returns a list of characters, effectively converting the input string into a list of individual characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings sorted in ascending order, where each string is an element from the original space-separated list of strings in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, sorts the strings in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

    #State: To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: We have a list `arr` containing positive integers, an empty list `ans`, and a variable `tem` initialized to 1.
    #
    #2. **Loop Iterations**:
    #   - **First Iteration (i=0)**: `tem` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`, and this product is appended to `ans`. So, `tem` becomes `arr[0]`, and `ans` becomes `[arr[0]]`.
    #   - **Second Iteration (i=1)**: `tem` (now `arr[0]`) is multiplied by the second element of `arr`, and this new product is appended to `ans`. So, `tem` becomes `arr[0] * arr[1]`, and `ans` becomes `[arr[0], arr[0]*arr[1]]`.
    #   - This pattern continues until the last element of `arr` is processed.
    #
    #3. **Final State**: After all iterations, `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr`, and `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` from the first to the last.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #**Output State**: `arr` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` from the first to the last, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    #
    #For example, if `arr = [2, 3, 4]`, then:
    #- `ans` would be `[2, 6, 24]` (cumulative products of the elements in `arr`), and
    #- `tem` would be `24` (product of all elements in `arr`).
    #
    #Thus, the output state maintains the same structure as the initial state but with `ans` populated with cumulative products and `tem` holding the final product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' containing the cumulative products of the elements in list 'arr' from the first to the last, where 'arr' is a list of positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a list of cumulative products of the elements in the input list 'arr', which is a list of positive integers. The function leaves the input list 'arr' unchanged and returns a new list 'ans' where each element at index 'i' is the product of all elements in 'arr' up to index 'i'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: ans is a list of integers, where each element at index i is the product of all elements in arr from index i to the end of the list, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each element at index i is the product of all elements in arr from index i to the end of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns a new list where each element at index i is the product of all elements in the input list from index i to the end. The function effectively calculates the cumulative product of the input list in reverse order.
