You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and then n lines each containing three integers x, y, and r (-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains no inputs.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is an integer, bipartite is a boolean, ok is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is an integer, bipartite is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. If ok is True, 'YES' is printed. If ok is False, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is an integer, bipartite is a boolean, and the current value of ok is True, stdin contains no inputs, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is an integer, bipartite is a boolean, ok is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. ok is False, and 'NO' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
