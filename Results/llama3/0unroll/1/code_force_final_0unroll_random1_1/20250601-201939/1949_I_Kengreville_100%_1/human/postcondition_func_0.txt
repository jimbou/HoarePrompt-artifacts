Determines whether a given set of circles can be colored with two colors such that no two overlapping circles have the same color. The function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of circles (n) and the subsequent n lines contain the x, y coordinates and radius of each circle. It then checks if it's possible to color the circles with two colors and prints 'YES' if possible, 'NO' otherwise.
