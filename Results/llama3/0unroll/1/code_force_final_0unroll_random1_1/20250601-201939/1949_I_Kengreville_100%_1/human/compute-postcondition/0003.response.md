The code snippet initializes three new variables: `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`, and assigns them initial values of 0, True, and False, respectively. These new variables do not affect the existing variables in the initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False, stdin contains no inputs.**
