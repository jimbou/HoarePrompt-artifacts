#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It unpacks the first integer from list 'a' and the first string from list 'b', adds them together, and returns the result as the first element of a tuple. Similarly, it unpacks the second integer from list 'a' and the second string from list 'b', adds them together, and returns the result as the second element of the tuple. The function does not modify the original lists 'a' and 'b'.
