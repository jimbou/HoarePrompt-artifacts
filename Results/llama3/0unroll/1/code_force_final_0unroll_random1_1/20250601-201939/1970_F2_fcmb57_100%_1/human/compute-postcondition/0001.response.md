Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.**

In other words, the program returns a tuple where the first element is the result of adding the first integer in list 'a' (x) to the first string in list 'b' (dx), and the second element is the result of adding the second integer in list 'a' (y) to the second string in list 'b' (dy).
