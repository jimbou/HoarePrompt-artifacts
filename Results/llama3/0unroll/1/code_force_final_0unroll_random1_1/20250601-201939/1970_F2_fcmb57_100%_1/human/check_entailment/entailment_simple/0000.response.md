Reasoning: The function func_1 is supposed to move an entity on the field by adding the movement vector to its current position. However, the function is incorrectly implemented. It is trying to add an integer and a string, which will result in a TypeError. The correct implementation should be to add the corresponding elements of the two lists, i.e., the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate separately.

Correctness: **False**
