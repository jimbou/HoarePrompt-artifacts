Output State: **a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, x is the first integer in a, y is the second integer in a, dx is the first string in b, dy is the second string in b.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are determined by the values of `a` and `b` before the code executes. The code assigns the first integer in `a` to `x` and the second integer in `a` to `y`. Similarly, it assigns the first string in `b` to `dx` and the second string in `b` to `dy`. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
