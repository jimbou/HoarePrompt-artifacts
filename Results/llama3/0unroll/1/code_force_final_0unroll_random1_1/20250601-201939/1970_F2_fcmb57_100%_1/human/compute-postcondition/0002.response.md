Functionality: **This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It unpacks the first integer from list 'a' and the first string from list 'b', adds them together, and returns the result as the first element of a tuple. Similarly, it unpacks the second integer from list 'a' and the second string from list 'b', adds them together, and returns the result as the second element of the tuple. The function does not modify the original lists 'a' and 'b'.**
