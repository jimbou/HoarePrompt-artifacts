Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem.

The program first checks if the minimum number of diagonals (k) is equal to the total number of diagonals in the grid (4n - 2). If this is the case, it prints k // 2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover all diagonals.

If k is not equal to 4n - 2, the program prints ceil(k / 2), which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals. This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals, so the minimum number of cells required is at least half of the number of diagonals that need to be covered.

The program uses the ceil function from the math module to round up the result of k / 2 to the nearest integer, which ensures that the minimum number of cells required is always an integer.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
