Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the square grid (n) and the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell (k).

The program then checks if the minimum number of diagonals is equal to 4n - 2, which is the total number of diagonals in the grid. If this condition is true, it prints k // 2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover all diagonals.

If the minimum number of diagonals is not equal to 4n - 2, the program prints ceil(k / 2), which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals.

The program's approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that each diagonal can be covered by coloring a single cell. By coloring ceil(k / 2) cells, we can ensure that at least k diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
