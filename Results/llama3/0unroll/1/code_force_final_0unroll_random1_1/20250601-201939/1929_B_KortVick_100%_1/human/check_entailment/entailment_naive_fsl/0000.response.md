Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is less than or equal to 2 * n - 2. In this case, the program prints ceil(k / 2), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be k.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 4, the program prints 2, which is correct. However, when n = 3 and k = 5, the program prints 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 4.

The correct solution should be:

if 4 * n - 2 == k:
    print(k // 2 + 1)
elif k <= 2 * n - 2:
    print(k)
else:
    print(ceil(k / 2))

This solution correctly handles all cases, including when k is less than or equal to 2 * n - 2.
