The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: the size of a square grid (n) and the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell (k). For each test case, it prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition. If the minimum number of diagonals is equal to 4n - 2, it prints k // 2 + 1; otherwise, it prints ceil(k / 2). The function processes all test cases and prints the results to the console.
