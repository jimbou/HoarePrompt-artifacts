Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program provided uses the following logic:

- If all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., k = 4n - 2), then the minimum number of cells to be colored is k // 2 + 1.
- Otherwise, the minimum number of cells to be colored is ceil(k / 2).

This logic is correct because:

- When all diagonals need to be colored, we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal. Since there are k // 2 diagonals in each direction (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left), we need to color at least k // 2 cells. However, since the diagonals intersect at the center of the grid, we need to color one additional cell to cover the intersection, hence k // 2 + 1.
- When not all diagonals need to be colored, we can color cells in a way that each cell covers two diagonals. Therefore, we need to color at least ceil(k / 2) cells to cover k diagonals.

The program correctly implements this logic using the ceil function from the math module to round up the division result when necessary.

Correctness: **True**
