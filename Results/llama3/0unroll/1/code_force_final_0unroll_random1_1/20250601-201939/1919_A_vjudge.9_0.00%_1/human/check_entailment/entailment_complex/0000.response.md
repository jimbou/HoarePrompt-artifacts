Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and notes to clarify the game's rules.

Function 1 takes two non-negative integers, a and b, as input and returns the winner based on whether their sum is even or odd. This function correctly implements the game's logic, as the winner is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, and calls Function 1 to determine the winner for each pair of input integers. It then prints the results.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the problem statement, the examples provided, and the implementation of the functions. The functions correctly implement the game's logic, and the program produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
