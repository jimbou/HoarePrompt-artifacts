Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game involves players taking turns exchanging wallets or keeping their current wallets and removing a coin from their wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the winner ('Bob' or 'Alice') based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This function seems to be implementing the game's winning condition, which is based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, and calls `func_1` with the input integers `a` and `b`. It then appends the result to a list and prints each result.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, and `func_2` correctly iterates over the test cases and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
