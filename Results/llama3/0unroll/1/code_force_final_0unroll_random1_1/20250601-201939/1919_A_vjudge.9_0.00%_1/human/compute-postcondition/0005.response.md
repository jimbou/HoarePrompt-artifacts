Functionality: **Determines the winner for each pair of input integers and returns the result.**

This function accepts two positive integers, a and b, as input and returns the winner based on some unknown criteria (implemented in the func_1 function). The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases (t) is provided by the user. For each test case, the function takes a pair of positive integers (a and b) as input, determines the winner using the func_1 function, and appends the result to a list (results). The function then prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that the results list contains the winner for each pair of input integers, and these results are printed to the console.
