Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program uses a simple and elegant approach to solve the problem. Function 1 takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, it means that the total number of coins is even. In this case, Alice will always be the one to make the last move, because she starts with an even number of coins. Since she can only remove one coin at a time, she will eventually run out of coins, and Bob will win.
* If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, it means that the total number of coins is odd. In this case, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, because he starts with an odd number of coins. Since he can only remove one coin at a time, he will eventually run out of coins, and Alice will win.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`. It calls Function 1 with these values and appends the result to the `results` list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described above. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` is a clever and efficient way to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
