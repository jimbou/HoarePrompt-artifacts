The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line prompts the user to enter the number of test cases and assigns the input value to the variable `t`. Since `t` is initially a positive integer, the new value of `t` will also be a positive integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`.

Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to the user's input, a and b are positive integers, results is an empty list**
