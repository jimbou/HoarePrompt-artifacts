Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move. This is because the last move will always involve removing the last coin from the wallet, leaving the opponent with an empty wallet and no valid moves.

The provided program uses a simple and elegant approach to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If the sum of the coins is even, it means that the total number of moves required to empty both wallets is even. Since Alice makes the first move, Bob will make the last move, and therefore win the game.
* If the sum of the coins is odd, it means that the total number of moves required to empty both wallets is odd. Since Alice makes the first move, Alice will make the last move, and therefore win the game.

This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that the game is won by the player who makes the last move, and that the number of moves required to empty both wallets determines who makes the last move.

Correctness: **True**
