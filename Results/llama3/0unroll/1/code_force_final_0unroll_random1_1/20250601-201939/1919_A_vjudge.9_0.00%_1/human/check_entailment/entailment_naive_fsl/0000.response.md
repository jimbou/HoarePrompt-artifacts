Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win.

The program correctly implements this logic in the `func_1` function, which returns 'Bob' if the sum of a and b is even and 'Alice' if it's odd. The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like a = b, a = 1, b = 1, and large values of a and b. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
