Postcondition: **The program prints a series of strings, each representing a row in the 2D array xx. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, the strings are constructed by iterating over each character in the corresponding row of xx. If the character is not '?', it is added to the string as is. If the character is '?' and the current row index i or column index j is in the first n//4 indices of sa, the string is appended with 'F'. Otherwise, the string is appended with 'S'. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, the strings are constructed by iterating over the characters in the corresponding string in xx. If the character is not '?', it is added to the new string. If the character is '?' and either the row or column index is in the first n/4 elements of sb, 'S' is added to the new string. Otherwise, 'F' is added to the new string. The values of n, a, b, sa, and sb remain unchanged.**
