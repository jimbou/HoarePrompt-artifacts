Output State: **The loop prints n strings of length n. Each string is constructed by iterating over the characters in the corresponding string in xx. If the character is not '?', it is added to the new string. If the character is '?' and either the row or column index is in the first n/4 elements of sb, 'S' is added to the new string. Otherwise, 'F' is added to the new string. The values of n, a, b, sa, and sb remain unchanged.**
