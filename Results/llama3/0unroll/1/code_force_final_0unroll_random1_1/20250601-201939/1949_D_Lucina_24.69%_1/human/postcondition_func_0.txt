This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints a series of strings to the console. It first reads an integer n and n strings of length n, then counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each string and stores them in lists a and b. It then identifies indices where 'F' or 'S' appears exclusively and stores them in lists sa and sb. Depending on the lengths of sa and sb, it constructs new strings by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sa or sb, and prints these strings to the console.
