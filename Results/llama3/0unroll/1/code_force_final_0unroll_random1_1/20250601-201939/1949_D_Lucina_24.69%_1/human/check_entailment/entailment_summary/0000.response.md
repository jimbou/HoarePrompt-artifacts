Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the type of transition videos for each pair of scenarios based on the given constraints. The program first counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each string and identifies the indices where 'F' or 'S' appears exclusively. It then constructs new strings by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sa or sb, ensuring that the constraint of not having more than ceil(3n/4) videos of the same type consecutively is satisfied.

The program handles the cases where the number of 'F' or 'S' characters is greater than or equal to the number of '?' characters correctly. It also handles the case where the number of 'F' or 'S' characters is less than the number of '?' characters correctly by assigning the remaining '?' characters to the type that has fewer characters.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
