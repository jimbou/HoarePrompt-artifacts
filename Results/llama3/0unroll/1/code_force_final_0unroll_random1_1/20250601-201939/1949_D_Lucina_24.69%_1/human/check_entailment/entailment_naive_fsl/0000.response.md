Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly identifies the number of scenarios, reads the partial transition video plan, and determines the type of each transition video to ensure that no more than ⌈3n/4⌉ transition videos of the same type are seen in a row.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign the type of each transition video. It first identifies the scenarios that have already been assigned a type (either funny or scary) and groups them into two lists, sa and sb. It then assigns the type of each remaining transition video based on the type of the scenarios it connects. If a scenario has not been assigned a type, it is assigned the type that is less common among the scenarios it connects to.

The program also ensures that the type of each transition video is consistent across all scenarios. For example, if a transition video is assigned the type 'F' (funny) when connecting scenarios A and B, it will also be assigned the type 'F' when connecting scenarios B and A.

The program's approach is correct because it ensures that the number of transition videos of the same type seen in a row is always less than or equal to ⌈3n/4⌉. This is because the program assigns the type of each transition video based on the type of the scenarios it connects, and it ensures that the type of each transition video is consistent across all scenarios.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
