stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), then n strings of length n. Each string contains only '.', 'F', 'S', and '?'. The number of 'F' and 'S' in all strings is at most floor(n/2). The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j.
