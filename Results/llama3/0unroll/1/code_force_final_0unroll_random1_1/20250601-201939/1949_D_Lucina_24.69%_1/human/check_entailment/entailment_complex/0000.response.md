Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to create transition videos for a video game. The program takes input from the user, which includes the number of scenarios (n) and a 2D array representing the transition videos between scenarios. The array contains characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.', where 'F' represents a funny video, 'S' represents a scary video, '?' represents an undecided video, and '.' represents no video.

The program first counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column of the array and stores them in lists a and b. It then identifies indices where 'F' or 'S' appears exclusively and stores them in lists sa and sb.

Depending on the lengths of sa and sb, the program constructs new strings by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sa or sb. The program ensures that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly identifies the indices where 'F' or 'S' appears exclusively and replaces '?' characters accordingly. The program also ensures that the constructed strings meet the condition of not having more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type consecutively.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
