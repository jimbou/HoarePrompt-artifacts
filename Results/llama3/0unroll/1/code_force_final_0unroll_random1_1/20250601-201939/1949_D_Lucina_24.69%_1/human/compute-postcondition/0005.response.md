Postcondition: **n remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 24. a remains unchanged, still a list of n+1 integers. b remains unchanged, still a list of n+1 integers. xx remains unchanged, still a list containing n strings of length n. stdin remains empty. sa is a list containing indices i where a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0. sb is a list containing indices i where b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0. The current value of the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb.**
