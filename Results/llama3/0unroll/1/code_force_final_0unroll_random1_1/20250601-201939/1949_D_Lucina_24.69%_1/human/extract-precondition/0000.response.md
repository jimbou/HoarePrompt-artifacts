Precondition: **stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 24) and then n strings of length n. Each string contains only the characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.'. The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j. At most n//2 characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.**
