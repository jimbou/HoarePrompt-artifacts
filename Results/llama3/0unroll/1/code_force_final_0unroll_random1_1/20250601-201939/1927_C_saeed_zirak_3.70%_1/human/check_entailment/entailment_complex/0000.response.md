Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It correctly calculates the target count of ones for each list (k/2).
3. The while loop correctly iterates over the range from 1 to k and updates the counts of ones in both lists based on the presence of the current number in both lists or in one of them.
4. The program correctly checks if the target count is reached for both lists and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
