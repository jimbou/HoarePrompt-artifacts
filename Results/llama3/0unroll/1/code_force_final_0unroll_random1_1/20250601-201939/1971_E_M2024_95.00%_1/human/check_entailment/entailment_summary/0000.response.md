Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by calculating the time it takes for the car to reach each query point. The program first calculates the differences between consecutive elements in sequences a and b, which represent the distances and times between consecutive signs, respectively. It then calculates the speed of the car between each pair of signs by dividing the distance by the time.

For each query, the program performs a binary search on sequence a to find the index of the sign that is closest to the query point but not beyond it. It then calculates the time it takes for the car to reach the query point by adding the time it takes to reach the previous sign and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance at the current speed.

The program correctly handles the case where the query point is exactly at a sign by printing the corresponding time from sequence b. It also correctly handles the case where the query point is beyond the last sign by using the last sign's time and speed to calculate the time.

The program's use of binary search to find the appropriate index in sequence a is efficient, especially for large inputs. The program's overall time complexity is O(q log k) per test case, where q is the number of queries and k is the number of signs.

Correctness: **True**
