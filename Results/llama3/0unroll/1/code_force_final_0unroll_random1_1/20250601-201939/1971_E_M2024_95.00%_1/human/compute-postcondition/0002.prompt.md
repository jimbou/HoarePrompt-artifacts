You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, and then k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 10^5 and k <= n <= 10^9. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, and a_i < a_{i+1} and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ad = [0]
        
        bd = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        
        print()
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program will have processed all the test cases and printed the results for each query in each test case. The values of the variables in the loop head and body will have been updated accordingly, but the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged. Specifically, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` will have been updated for each test case, and the results for each query will have been printed. The final output state will be the last printed result for the last query in the last test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
