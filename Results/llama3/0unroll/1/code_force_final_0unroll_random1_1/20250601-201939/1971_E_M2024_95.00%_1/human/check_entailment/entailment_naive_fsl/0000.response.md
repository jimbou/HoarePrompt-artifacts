Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It calculates the speed of the car between each pair of points and uses this speed to calculate the time it takes to reach each query point. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including when the query point is exactly at one of the known points, and when it is between two known points.

The program uses binary search to find the segment that the query point belongs to, which is efficient and correct. It then calculates the time it takes to reach the query point by adding the time it takes to reach the start of the segment and the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the speed of the segment.

The program also handles the case when the query point is at the end of the segment correctly, by printing the time it takes to reach the end of the segment.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
