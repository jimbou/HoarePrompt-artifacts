Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: three integers (n, k, q) and three sequences of integers (a, b, d). It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in sequences a and b, and then uses these differences to compute a new sequence v. For each query in each test case, it performs a binary search on sequence a to find the appropriate index, and then uses the corresponding values from sequences b and v to calculate and print the result. The function continues this process until all test cases and queries have been processed, printing the results for each query in each test case.**
