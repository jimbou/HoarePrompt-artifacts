Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, and then k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 10^5 and k <= n <= 10^9. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n, and a_i < a_{i+1} and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n.**
