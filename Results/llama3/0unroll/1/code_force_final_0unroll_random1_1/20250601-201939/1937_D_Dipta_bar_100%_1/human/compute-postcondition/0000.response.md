Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list**

The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` consists of characters '<' and '>', the length of `s` is the total number of these characters. The code also initializes two empty lists, `A` and `idx_A`, which remain unchanged throughout the execution. The final state includes the original string `s`, the length of `s` stored in `n`, and the two empty lists `A` and `idx_A`.
