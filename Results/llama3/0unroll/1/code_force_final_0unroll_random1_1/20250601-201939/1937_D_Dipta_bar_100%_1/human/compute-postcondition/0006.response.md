Output State: **B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the length of B**

The code initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, and assigns them values based on the length of the list `B`. The value of `l` is set to 0, and the value of `r` is set to the length of `B`. The variables `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
