This function takes a string s consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and prints the total number of pairs of '<' and '>' characters that can be matched at each position in the string, considering both forward and backward matching. The function iterates through the string, maintaining two lists A and B to keep track of the cumulative count of '<' and '>' characters, respectively. It then uses these lists to calculate the total number of pairs at each position, considering both forward and backward matching, and prints the results. The function handles cases where there are no matching pairs, as well as cases where the matching pairs are not contiguous.
