Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately simulates the movement of the pinball according to the given rules and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to move from the left and right ends of the grid to each cell, respectively. The arrays idx_A and idx_B store the indices of the cells where the pinball changes direction.

The program then iterates through the grid from left to right, and for each cell, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the following cases:

1. If the pinball is moving to the right and there are cells to the right with '<' characters, it calculates the number of seconds it takes to reach the first cell with a '<' character and then adds the cumulative sum of seconds from the A array.
2. If the pinball is moving to the right and there are no cells to the right with '<' characters, it simply calculates the number of seconds it takes to reach the right end of the grid.
3. If the pinball is moving to the left and there are cells to the left with '>' characters, it calculates the number of seconds it takes to reach the first cell with a '>' character and then adds the cumulative sum of seconds from the B array.
4. If the pinball is moving to the left and there are no cells to the left with '>' characters, it simply calculates the number of seconds it takes to reach the left end of the grid.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, and the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
