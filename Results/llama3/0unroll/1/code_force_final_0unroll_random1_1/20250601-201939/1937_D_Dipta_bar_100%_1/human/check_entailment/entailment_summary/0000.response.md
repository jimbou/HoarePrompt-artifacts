Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two lists, A and B, to keep track of the cumulative count of '<' and '>' characters, respectively, and then uses these lists to calculate the total number of pairs at each position, considering both forward and backward matching.

The program handles all possible cases, including when there are no matching pairs, and when the matching pairs are not contiguous. It also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the pinball is placed at the leftmost or rightmost cell of the grid.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program is working as expected, printing the correct output for the given input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
