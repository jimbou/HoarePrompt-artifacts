Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code initializes two new variables, B and idx_B, and assigns them empty list values. This does not affect the existing variables A and idx_A, which remain unchanged.
