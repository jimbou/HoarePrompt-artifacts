Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' or '1'.
3. It then checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
4. The program's logic is based on the fact that a square has the same number of '1's in each row, while a triangle has a different number of '1's in each row.
5. The program correctly handles the case where the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, as guaranteed by the problem statement.

The program's logic is simple and correct, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
