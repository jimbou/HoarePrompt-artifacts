Output State: The loop will execute 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read a test case from stdin, process it, and print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the shape formed by '1's in the grid. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The value of 'a' will remain unchanged.
