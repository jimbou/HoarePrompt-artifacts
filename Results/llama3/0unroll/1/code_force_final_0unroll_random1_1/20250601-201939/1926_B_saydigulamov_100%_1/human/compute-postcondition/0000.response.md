Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains a test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `a` now holds an integer value between 1 and 100, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n` strings of length `n` containing '0' or '1' characters, with the grid containing either a triangle or a square of '1's with a size greater than 1.
