Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The condition `if k[0] == k[1]:` is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This condition only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, but it does not check if the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid, which is a requirement for a square.

For example, if the input is:

```
3
000
011
110
```

The program will output "SQUARE", but the shape is actually a triangle. The '1's in the second and third rows are not positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

A correct solution would need to check the position of the '1's in each row, not just the number of '1's.
