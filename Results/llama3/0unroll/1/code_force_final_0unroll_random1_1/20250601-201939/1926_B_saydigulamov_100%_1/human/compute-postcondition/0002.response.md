Output State: **The loop will execute 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read a test case from stdin, determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the count of '1's in the strings, and print 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' accordingly. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The value of 'a' and the contents of stdin will remain unchanged.**
