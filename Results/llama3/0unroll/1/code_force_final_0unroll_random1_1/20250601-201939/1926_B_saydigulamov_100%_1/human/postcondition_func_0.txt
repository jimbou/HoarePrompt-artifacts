This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. It analyzes each grid to determine whether it contains a triangle or a square shape formed by the '1's, and prints 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' accordingly. The function processes a variable number of test cases, as specified by the initial input, and does not modify the input values.
