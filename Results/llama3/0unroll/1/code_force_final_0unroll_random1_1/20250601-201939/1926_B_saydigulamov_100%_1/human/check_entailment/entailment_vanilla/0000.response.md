Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of '1's in the first two rows of the grid are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement defines a triangle as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i-1 consecutive characters '1', and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside-down triangle is also considered a valid triangle. A square is defined as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1', which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program's approach does not take into account the actual shape of the grid, but rather only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal. This is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square.

For example, consider the following grid:

0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1111111110
0111111100
0011111000
0001110000
0000100000

This grid forms a triangle, but the program would incorrectly print 'SQUARE' because the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
