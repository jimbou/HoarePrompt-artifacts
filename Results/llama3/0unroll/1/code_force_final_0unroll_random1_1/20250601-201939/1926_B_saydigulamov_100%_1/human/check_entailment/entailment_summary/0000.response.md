Reasoning:
The given program is designed to determine whether a given grid of '0's and '1's contains a triangle or a square shape formed by the '1's. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It then analyzes each grid to determine whether it contains a triangle or a square shape formed by the '1's.

The program uses a simple approach to determine the shape. It counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid and stores these counts in a list. If the first two counts are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

This approach is correct because a square shape will always have the same number of '1's in each row, while a triangle shape will have a different number of '1's in each row.

However, there is a flaw in the program. It does not check if the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, as guaranteed by the problem statement. If the grid contains multiple shapes or no shape at all, the program may produce incorrect results.

Despite this flaw, the program is correct for the given problem description and execution summary, assuming valid inputs as described in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
