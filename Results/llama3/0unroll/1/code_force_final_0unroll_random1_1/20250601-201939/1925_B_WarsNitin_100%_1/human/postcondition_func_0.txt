This function reads a series of input pairs (x, n) from standard input, where x and n are integers, and for each pair, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a divisor i of x such that x - n*i is a multiple of i and non-negative. The function processes multiple test cases, as specified by an initial integer t, and outputs the maximum possible value for each test case.
