Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given subarray is "good" according to the problem's conditions. It calculates the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the array, then for each query, it checks if the sum of the elements in the query range minus the range length is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the range. This is a correct interpretation of the problem's conditions. The program also handles the edge case where the query range has only one element, in which case it prints 'NO'. The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected output for the given example.

Correctness: **True**
