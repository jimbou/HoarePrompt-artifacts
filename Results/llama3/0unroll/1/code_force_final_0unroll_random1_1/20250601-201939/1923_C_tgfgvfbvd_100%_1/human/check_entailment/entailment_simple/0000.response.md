Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates two prefix sum arrays, `p` and `c`, where `p` stores the cumulative sum of the input array `l`, and `c` stores the cumulative count of 1's in the input array `l`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum and count of 1's in any subarray in constant time.
3. For each query, the program calculates the sum `s` and count of 1's `i` in the subarray from index `a` to `b` using the prefix sum arrays.
4. It then checks the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, which is equivalent to checking if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of 1's in the subarray. This condition is necessary and sufficient for the subarray to be "good" according to the problem statement.
5. If the condition is met, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the output will be correct for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
