Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first calculates the prefix sum array `p` and the count of 1's array `c`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of the subarray and the count of 1's in the subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `s` and the count of 1's `i` in the subarray. 

3. The program then checks if the subarray is good by checking if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray. This is because the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray represents the total amount that can be distributed among the elements of the subarray to make them all greater than 1, and this amount must be greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray.

4. The program also checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1, because a subarray of length 1 cannot be good.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases such as a subarray of length 1, a subarray with all elements equal to 1, and a subarray with a sum that is not sufficient to make all elements greater than 1. 

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
