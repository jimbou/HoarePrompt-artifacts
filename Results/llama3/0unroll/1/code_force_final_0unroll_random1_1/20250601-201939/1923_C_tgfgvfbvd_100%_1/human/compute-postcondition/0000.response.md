Output State: **The output state will contain the results of all the test cases. Each test case will have a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, one for each query. The 'YES' or 'NO' output for each query will depend on whether the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is met or not. If the condition is met, the output will be 'YES', otherwise it will be 'NO'. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for each test case will be equal to the value of `m` for that test case.**
