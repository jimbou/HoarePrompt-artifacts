This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer n, an integer m, a list of n integers, and m queries. The function calculates the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the list, then for each query, it checks if the sum of the elements in the query range minus the range length is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the range. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and queries, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs.
