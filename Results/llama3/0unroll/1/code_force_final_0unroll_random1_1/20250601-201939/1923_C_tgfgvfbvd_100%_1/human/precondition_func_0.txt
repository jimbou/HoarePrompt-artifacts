stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers. The list of integers is followed by q queries, each query consisting of two integers l and r. The integers t, n, and q are positive. The integers in the list are positive. The integers l and r are positive and l <= r <= n.
