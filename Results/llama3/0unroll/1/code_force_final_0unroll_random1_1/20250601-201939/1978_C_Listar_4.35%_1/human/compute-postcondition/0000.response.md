Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_2()`. The precondition that `n` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 0 is no longer guaranteed, as the new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the function `func_2()`. The output state only guarantees that `n` and `k` are integers, but their specific values are now determined by the function `func_2()`.
