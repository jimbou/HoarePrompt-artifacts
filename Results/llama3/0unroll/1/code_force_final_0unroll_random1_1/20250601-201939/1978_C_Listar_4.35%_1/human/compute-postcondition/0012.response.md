Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to a value between 1/2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).**
