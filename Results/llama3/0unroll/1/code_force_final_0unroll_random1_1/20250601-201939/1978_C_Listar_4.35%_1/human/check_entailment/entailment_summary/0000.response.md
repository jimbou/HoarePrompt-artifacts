Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. `func_2()` correctly determines whether a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k` exists for a given length `n`. It checks if `k` is odd, calculates the maximum possible `k` based on `n`, and returns `(0, 0)` if `k` exceeds this maximum value. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. `func_1()` correctly generates a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k` for a given length `n`. It rotates the list of integers to the right by a specified number of places, with the last element moving to the front of the list.

3. `func_3()` correctly prints the permutation generated by `func_1()` in the required format.

4. `func_4()` correctly orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_2()` to determine if a permutation exists, and if so, calls `func_1()` to generate the permutation and `func_3()` to print it.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when no permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
