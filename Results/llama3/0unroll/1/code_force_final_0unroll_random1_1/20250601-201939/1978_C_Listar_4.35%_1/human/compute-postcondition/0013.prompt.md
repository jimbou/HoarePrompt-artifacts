You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: the first value is 0 and the second value is also 0. The value of `n` and `k` does not affect the output as they are not used in the return statement. The value of `k` being odd is also not relevant to the output.
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin contains no input. k is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is an integer such that 1/2 <= max_k <= 2 * 10^10.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: the first value is 0, and the second value is also 0.
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is an integer such that 1/2 <= max_k <= 2 * 10^10. `max_k` is larger than or equal to `k`
    return n, k
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to a value between 1/2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns two values: the first value is 0 and the second value is also 0. The value of `n` and `k` does not affect the output as they are not used in the return statement. The value of `k` being odd is also not relevant to the output.

Case_2: The program returns two values: the first value is 0, and the second value is also 0.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple containing two values: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `k` is less than or equal to a value between 1/2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
