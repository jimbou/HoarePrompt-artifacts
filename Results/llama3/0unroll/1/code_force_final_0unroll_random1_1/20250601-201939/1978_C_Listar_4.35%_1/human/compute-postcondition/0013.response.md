Functionality: **This function takes two integers, n and k, as input and returns either a tuple containing the original values of n and k, or a tuple containing two zeros. The function first checks if k is odd, in which case it immediately returns (0, 0). If k is even, it calculates a maximum possible value for k based on n, and if k exceeds this maximum value, it also returns (0, 0). If k is within the valid range, the function returns the original values of n and k.**
