This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of 'n' and 'k' returned by 'func_2()'. If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without any further action. If 'n' is not 0, it calls 'func_1()' with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, assigns the result to 'l', and then calls 'func_3()' with 'l' as an argument, before returning without any value.
