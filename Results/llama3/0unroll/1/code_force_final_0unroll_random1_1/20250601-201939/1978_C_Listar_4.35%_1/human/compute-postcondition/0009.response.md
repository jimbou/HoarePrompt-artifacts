Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, the current value of `max_k` is an integer equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, the current value of `max_k` is an integer such that 1/2 <= max_k <= 2 * 10^10. The current value of `max_k` is less than the current value of `k`.***
