Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n is even and k is odd, the program will not be able to find a suitable permutation, but it does not handle this case correctly. It simply returns (0, 0) in func_2, but it should return a message indicating that no suitable permutation exists.

Additionally, the program does not check if the input values of n and k are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). If the input values are outside these ranges, the program may not work correctly.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
