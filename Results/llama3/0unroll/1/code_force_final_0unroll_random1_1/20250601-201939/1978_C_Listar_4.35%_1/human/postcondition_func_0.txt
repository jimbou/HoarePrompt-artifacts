Rotates a list of integers to the right by a specified number of places, with the last element moving to the front of the list, and returns the rotated list. The function takes two parameters: a positive integer n representing the number of elements in the list, and a non-negative integer k representing the number of places to rotate the list. The function returns the rotated list, where the rotation is performed by moving the last element to the front of the list and shifting the remaining elements to the right.
