The function reads multiple sets of input data from stdin, where each set contains two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines of two integers v and u. It then processes each set of input data by calling the solve() function, which produces some output or modifies variables based on the input data. The function iterates over all sets of input data in stdin, with the final output state being the result of the last iteration.
