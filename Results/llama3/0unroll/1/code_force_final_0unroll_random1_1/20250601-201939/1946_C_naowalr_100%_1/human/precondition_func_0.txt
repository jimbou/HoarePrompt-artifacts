stdin contains multiple sets of input data. Each set of input data starts with a line containing two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that k < n. This is followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, where v and u are positive integers such that 1 <= v, u <= n.
