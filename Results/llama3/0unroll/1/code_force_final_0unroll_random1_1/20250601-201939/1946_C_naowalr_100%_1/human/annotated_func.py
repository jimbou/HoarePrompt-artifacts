#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple sets of input data. Each set of input data starts with a line containing two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that k < n. This is followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, where v and u are positive integers such that 1 <= v, u <= n.
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a number of iterations equal to the number of sets of input data in stdin. In each iteration, the function solve() will be called, and it will process the input data for that iteration. The output state will depend on the implementation of the solve() function, which is not provided. However, it can be assumed that the solve() function will process the input data and produce some output or modify some variables. The final output state will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, with the variables modified by the solve() function in the last iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of input data from stdin, where each set contains two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines of two integers v and u. It then processes each set of input data by calling the solve() function, which produces some output or modifies variables based on the input data. The function iterates over all sets of input data in stdin, with the final output state being the result of the last iteration.
