Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a prefix sum array `pd` to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `N`, where `N` is the maximum possible value of `n`. This allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of the digit sums for any given `n` by simply looking up the value in the `pd` array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, and the large case where `n` is 200000. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is a number with multiple digits, such as 1434 or 2024.

The program's use of a prefix sum array is an efficient solution to the problem, as it allows it to avoid recalculating the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n`. This makes the program run within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem for all possible cases.
