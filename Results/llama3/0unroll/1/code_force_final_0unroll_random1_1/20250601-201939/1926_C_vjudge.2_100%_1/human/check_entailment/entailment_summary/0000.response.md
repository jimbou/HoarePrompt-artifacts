Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Precomputation**: The program starts by precomputing the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 (200,000) and storing them in an array `pd`. This is done to avoid redundant calculations during the actual computation.

2. **Precomputation Logic**: The precomputation logic is correct. It iterates over all numbers from 1 to 200,000, converts each number to a string to extract its digits, and sums up these digits. The sum is then added to the corresponding index in the `pd` array.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It uses the precomputed sum stored in `pd[n]` to print the result.

4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the maximum value (2 * 10^5) and t is the number of test cases. This is within the acceptable time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N), which is also acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

6. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input as specified in the problem description.

7. **Output**: The program produces the correct output for the given examples and should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected results for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
