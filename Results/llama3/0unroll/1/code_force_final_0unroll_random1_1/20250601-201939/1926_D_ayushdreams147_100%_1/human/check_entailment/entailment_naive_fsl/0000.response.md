Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition. The function `func_1` iterates over the input list `a` and for each number, it checks if its bitwise complement is already in the `count` dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count and removes the number from the dictionary if the count becomes zero. If the bitwise complement is not in the dictionary, it adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1 and increments the result `res`. This way, the program ensures that each number is placed in a group with its bitwise complement, if possible, and counts the minimum number of groups required.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where a number is its own bitwise complement (i.e., 0 and 2147483647). The use of the `count` dictionary allows the program to efficiently keep track of the numbers and their complements, and the bitwise XOR operation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` is used to calculate the bitwise complement of each number.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
