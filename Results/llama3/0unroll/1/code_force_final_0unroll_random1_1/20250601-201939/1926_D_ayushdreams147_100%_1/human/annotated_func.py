#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: res is the number of unique integers in the list a, count is an empty dictionary.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list 'a'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique integers in the list. It does not modify the input list. The function counts the unique integers by iterating through the list, using a dictionary to keep track of the count of each integer and its bitwise complement. The function returns the total count of unique integers.
