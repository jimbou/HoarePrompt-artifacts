Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique integers in the list. It does not modify the input list. The function counts the unique integers by iterating through the list, using a dictionary to keep track of the count of each integer and its bitwise complement. The function returns the total count of unique integers.**
