Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The program uses a clever approach by iterating over the possible values of x and y, where x is a divisor of a and y is a divisor of b. It then checks if the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1, and if so, it adds the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) to the count. This is because for each pair (x, y) that satisfies the conditions, there are n / ((x + y) * x) possible values of a and m // ((x + y) * y) possible values of b.

The program also correctly handles the case where x = y = 1, which is a special case that needs to be handled separately.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
