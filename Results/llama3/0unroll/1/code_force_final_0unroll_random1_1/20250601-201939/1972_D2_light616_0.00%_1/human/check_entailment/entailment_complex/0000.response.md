Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function 1 reads two positive integers n and m from standard input, calculates the number of pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and gcd(a, b) = 1, and prints the result. However, this function does not directly solve the problem, as it only considers pairs with gcd(a, b) = 1, whereas the problem requires gcd(a, b) to be a factor of a + b.

Function 2 reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m, and calls Function 1 for each line. However, Function 1 does not solve the problem correctly, so Function 2 also does not solve the problem correctly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
