Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:

1. It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
2. It reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
3. It uses a while loop to iterate over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`. This is because the maximum possible value of `x` is the square root of `n`.
4. Inside the loop, it uses another while loop to iterate over possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This is because the maximum possible value of `y` is the minimum of `n / (x + y)` and `m / (x + y)`.
5. Inside the inner loop, it checks if `gcd(x, y)` is equal to 1. If it is, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because the number of valid pairs for a given `x` and `y` is the minimum of the number of possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

The program seems to be correct, as it iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` and correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each pair of `x` and `y`. It also handles the case where `gcd(x, y)` is not equal to 1, in which case it does not increment `cnt`.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The inner while loop iterates over all possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This could potentially lead to a large number of iterations, especially for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach might be to use a different algorithm or data structure to reduce the number of iterations.

Despite this potential issue, the program seems to be correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
