Reasoning:

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function `func_1` reads two positive integers n and m from standard input and calculates the number of pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and gcd(a, b) = 1. However, this function does not directly check if b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function `func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m, and calls `func_1` for each line.

Upon closer inspection of `func_1`, it can be seen that the condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is used to check if gcd(a, b) = 1. However, the problem statement requires gcd(a, b) to be a factor of a + b, not necessarily equal to 1. This indicates that `func_1` is not correctly implementing the problem statement.

Moreover, the calculation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` seems to be counting the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition gcd(a, b) = 1, but it does not take into account the condition b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that the program is not correctly implementing the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
