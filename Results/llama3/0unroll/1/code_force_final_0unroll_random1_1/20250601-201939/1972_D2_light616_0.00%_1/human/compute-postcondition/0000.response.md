The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**
