Output State: **The final output state is the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive, which is the minimum of n-2 and the sum of x, sx, and -2.**

In this output state, the variable 'cons' stores the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive. The value of 'cons' is calculated by taking the minimum of 'n-2' and the sum of 'x', 'sx', and '-2'. The variable 'sx' stores the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list 'l', and 'x' is the number of elements in the list. The output state is the result of the loop executing all its iterations, and it represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array consecutive.
