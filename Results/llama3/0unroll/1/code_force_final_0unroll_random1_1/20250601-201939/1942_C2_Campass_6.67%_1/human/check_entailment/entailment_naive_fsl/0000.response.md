Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by first sorting the chosen vertices and then calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. It takes into account the constraint on y and ensures that the total number of vertices chosen does not exceed n.

The program uses a greedy approach to select the vertices that can form the maximum number of triangles. It first calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the already chosen vertices and then iteratively adds more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

The program also handles the edge case where the number of vertices that can be chosen is limited by the constraint on y. In this case, it calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the available vertices.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
