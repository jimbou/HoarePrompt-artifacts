Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains three integers n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. The first line of the code reads an integer `t` from stdin using the `R` function and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. 

The remaining lines in stdin contain `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is between 4 and 10^9, `x` is between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, and `y` is between 0 and `n - x`. The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 

Since the code only reads the first line of stdin and assigns it to `t`, the remaining lines in stdin are not affected. Therefore, the output state includes `t` as an integer between 1 and 10^4, and stdin contains `t-1` inputs, each consisting of two lines as described above.
