Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs" problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained by choosing a certain number of vertices in a regular polygon.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained. The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the necessary steps to solve the problem.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. It then reads the vertices Bessie has chosen and sorts them.

The program then calculates the number of triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained by choosing the remaining vertices. It does this by iterating over the sorted list of vertices and calculating the number of triangular pieces that can be obtained by choosing the vertices in each gap between the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of vertices that can be chosen is less than the number of gaps between the vertices Bessie has chosen. In this case, it calculates the number of triangular pieces that can be obtained by choosing the vertices in the gaps until the number of vertices that can be chosen is exhausted.

Finally, the program outputs the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained, which is the minimum of the total number of sides of the polygon minus 2 and the sum of the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the number of triangular pieces that can be obtained by choosing the remaining vertices, and -2.

Correctness: **True**
