Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

The program iterates through the array from left to right, applying the operation at each index `i` as many times as possible without making `a[i]` negative. This is done by subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`, where `opNum` is the maximum number of operations that can be applied at index `i` without making `a[i]` negative.

After iterating through the array, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the operation. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the case where the array has less than three elements, as it checks if `n` is less than 3 before iterating through the array.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains negative numbers, as it checks if `a[i]` is less than 0 at each index `i` and prints "NO" if it is.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
