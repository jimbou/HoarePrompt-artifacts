Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

    4
    1 2 7 2

The program will output "NO", but it should output "YES" because it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by applying the operation from left to right. However, the problem statement does not restrict the order in which the operations are applied. Therefore, the program is not correct.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible orders of applying the operations, not just from left to right.
