Output State: **The output state will contain the results of the loop's execution for each test case. For each test case, if the loop finds a negative number in the array a, it will print 'NO' and move on to the next test case. If the loop successfully iterates through the array without finding a negative number, it will check if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it will print 'YES', otherwise it will print 'NO'. The output state will contain these 'YES' or 'NO' results for each test case, separated by newline characters. The value of numTest will be unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.**
