Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes an integer t (number of test cases) followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (number of elements) and n integers. The function checks if the integers in each test case can be transformed into zeros by a series of operations, printing 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise. If a negative number is encountered during the transformation, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. The output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' results, one for each test case, separated by newline characters.**
