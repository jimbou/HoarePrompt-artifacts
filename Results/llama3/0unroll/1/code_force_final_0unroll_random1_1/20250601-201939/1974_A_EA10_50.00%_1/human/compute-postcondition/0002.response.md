Functionality: **This function reads an integer 't' from standard input, followed by 't' lines each containing two integers 'x' and 'y'. It then performs calculations using these integers and prints the result for each pair. The function does not return any value, but instead, outputs 't' lines to the standard output, each containing a calculated integer. The input values 'x' and 'y' are not modified, and the input stream is consumed until it is empty.**
