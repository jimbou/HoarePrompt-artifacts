Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), because one line has been consumed by the input statement.
