Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is (x, y) = (0, 1), the program outputs 1, but the correct output should be 1, because one 2x2 icon can occupy a whole screen.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (z) and then adds the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15. However, this calculation is not correct when there are no 1x1 icons (x = 0) and there is one 2x2 icon (y = 1). In this case, the program should output 1, but it outputs 1, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case where there are no 1x1 icons and there is one 2x2 icon separately.
