Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations and takes into account the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0, indicating that there are no valid permutations.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of permutations using dynamic programming. It first calculates the number of permutations for the suffix maximums, then for the prefix maximums. The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate the binomial coefficients, which is a key component of the dynamic programming approach.

The `func_1` function is used to calculate the modular inverse of a number, which is necessary for calculating the binomial coefficients. The `func_2` function uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator of the binomial coefficient.

The program correctly handles the case where the input values are large, by using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
