Reasoning:

The problem is asking to determine the number of different permutations that could have been guessed given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and `b` modulo `1000000007`.

However, the program does not provide the main function that reads the input, processes the data, and outputs the result. Therefore, it is incomplete and cannot be executed as is.

Moreover, the problem statement requires the output to be the number of suitable permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`, but the program does not provide any logic to calculate this value.

Therefore, based on the provided code, it is not possible to determine the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
