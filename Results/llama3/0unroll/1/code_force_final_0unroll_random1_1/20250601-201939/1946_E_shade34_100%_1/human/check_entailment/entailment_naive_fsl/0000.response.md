Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed. The problem description requires the program to output the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7, but the program does not perform this calculation correctly.

The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, but it does not use them to calculate the number of permutations. Instead, it seems to be implementing a modular inverse calculation, which is not relevant to the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions, which involves counting the number of ways to arrange the elements of the permutation such that the prefix and suffix maximums are in the correct positions. This would require a more complex algorithm that takes into account the given indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

For example, if the input is n = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = 3, p = [1, 2], and s = [2, 3, 4], the program should output 3, because there are three permutations that satisfy the conditions: [1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3, 1], and [3, 4, 2, 1]. However, the program does not produce this output, indicating that it is incorrect.
