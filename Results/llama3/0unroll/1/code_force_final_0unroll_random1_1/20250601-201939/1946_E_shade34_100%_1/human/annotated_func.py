#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer, and the value 0 is the current value of variable b, which is also an integer and is equal to 0.

    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`. Here, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. Because a is not less than b, a // b is at least 1. Therefore, the second value is the negative of a non-negative integer.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: `d` which is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` where `c` is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer not less than `b`, and `d` is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is 0, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the second and first return values of func_1, respectively. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second return value of func_1 and the difference between the first return value of func_1 and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, and b is a prime number.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and 'c' (which is the return value of func_1(b, 1000000007)) modulo 1000000007, where 'c' is a value returned by func_1(b, 1000000007) and 'b' is a prime number.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two parameters, a non-negative integer 'a' and a prime number 'b', and returns the product of 'a' and a value 'c' (obtained by calling func_1(b, 1000000007)) modulo 1000000007.
