Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed.

Function func_1 is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' under modulo 'b'. This function is used in func_2 to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a factorial number.

Function func_2 is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a factorial number 'a' under modulo 1000000007. This function is used in the main program to calculate the number of permutations.

The main program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If these conditions are not met, the program prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations using func_2 and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
