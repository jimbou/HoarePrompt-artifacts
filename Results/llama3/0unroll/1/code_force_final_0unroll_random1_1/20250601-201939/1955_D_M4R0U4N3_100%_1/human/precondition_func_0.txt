stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers and a list of m integers. n, m, and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The integers in the lists are between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
