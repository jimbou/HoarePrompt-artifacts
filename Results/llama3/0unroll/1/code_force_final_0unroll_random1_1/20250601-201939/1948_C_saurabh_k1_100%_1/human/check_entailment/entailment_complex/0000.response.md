Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid of arrows.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each pair of columns, it checks if the arrows in the current column and the next column are both pointing to the left ('<'). If this condition is met, it means that the robot cannot move to the right and reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.

If the loop completes without finding any such pair of columns, it means that the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement, including the fact that n is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.

Correctness: **True**
