Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer (n) such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even; the second and third lines contain strings consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even, and the second and third lines contain strings consisting of exactly `n` characters '<' and/or '>'.
