Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an even integer n, and two strings of length n containing '<' and/or '>' characters. It then checks if the characters in the two strings can be rearranged to form a valid sequence of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it prints 'yes' if the strings can be rearranged, and 'no' otherwise. The function does not modify the input strings or the value of t, and only prints the result for each test case.**
