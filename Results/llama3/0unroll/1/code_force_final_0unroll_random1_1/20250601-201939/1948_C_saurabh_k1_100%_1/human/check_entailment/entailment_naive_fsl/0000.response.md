Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print "yes", but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if there are any pairs of cells with '<' arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n), but it does not consider the case where the robot gets stuck in an infinite loop.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to keep track of the cells that the robot has visited and check if it has already visited a cell before moving to it again. If it has, then it means that the robot is stuck in an infinite loop and cannot reach the cell (2, n).
