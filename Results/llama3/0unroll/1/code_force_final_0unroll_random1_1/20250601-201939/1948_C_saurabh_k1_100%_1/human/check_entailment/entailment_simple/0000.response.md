Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program iterates through each test case, reading the number of columns (n) and the two strings representing the arrows in the grid. It then checks for each pair of adjacent columns (i and i+1) whether the arrows in the current cell and the cell below it are both pointing left ('<'). If such a pair is found, it prints 'No' and breaks the loop. If no such pair is found after checking all columns, it prints 'yes'.

The program's logic is correct because if there is a pair of adjacent columns where both arrows point left, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it would be blocked by the left-pointing arrows. On the other hand, if no such pair is found, the robot can always move to the right and follow the arrows to reach the cell (2, n).

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.

Correctness: **True**
