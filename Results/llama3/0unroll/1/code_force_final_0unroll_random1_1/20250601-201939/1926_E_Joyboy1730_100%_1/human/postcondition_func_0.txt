This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of n and k, and prints the result to standard output. The function performs a total of t calculations and prints t results, one per test case.
