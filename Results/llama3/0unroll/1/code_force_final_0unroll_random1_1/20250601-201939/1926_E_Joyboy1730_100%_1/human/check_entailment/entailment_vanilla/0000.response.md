Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cards and `k` is the position of the card to be found.

3. The program then calculates the number of cards in each category (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and rounding up. The results are stored in the list `L`.

4. The program then iterates over the list `L` and checks if the current category contains the `k`-th card. If it does, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, where `pow` is the current power of 2 and `tot` is the total number of cards in the previous categories.

5. If the `k`-th card is found, its value is printed.

6. The program repeats steps 2-5 for each test case.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
