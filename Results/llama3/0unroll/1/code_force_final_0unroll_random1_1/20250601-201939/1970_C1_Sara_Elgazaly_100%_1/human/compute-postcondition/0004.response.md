Output State: **lst[tmp] is an empty list, one is False if the initial value of z is even and True if the initial value of z is odd, tmp is equal to z, rev remains unchanged, z remains unchanged, two is True.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value True to the variable two. The second line assigns the value of z to the variable tmp. 

Since the initial state of one depends on the parity of z, its value remains unchanged. The initial state of lst[tmp] is an empty list, and there are no operations that modify this list, so it remains empty. The initial state of rev and z is that they remain unchanged, and there are no operations that modify them, so they remain unchanged. The variable tmp is assigned the value of z, so its new value is equal to z. The variable two is assigned the value True.
