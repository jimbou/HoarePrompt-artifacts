Output State: **lst[tmp] is an empty list, one is False if the initial value of z is even and True if the initial value of z is odd, tmp is the last node visited in the graph, rev and z remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of children for the last node visited (tmp) in the graph is empty, the boolean variable one is False if the initial value of z is even and True if the initial value of z is odd, and the value of tmp is the last node visited in the graph. The dictionaries rev and the integer z remain unchanged.
