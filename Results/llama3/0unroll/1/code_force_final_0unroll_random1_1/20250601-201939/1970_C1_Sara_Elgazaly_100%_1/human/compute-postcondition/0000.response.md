Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary, rev is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, followed by one line containing one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and `y` is 1, these values are assigned to `x` and `y`. The second and third lines initialize `lst` and `rev` as empty dictionaries. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin remains the same, containing n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, followed by one line containing one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
