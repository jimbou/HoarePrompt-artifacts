Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between cities in both forward and backward directions.

The function `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city by comparing the distances between the current city and its neighboring cities. If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it sets the distance to 1; otherwise, it sets the distance to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The program then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between cities in both forward and backward directions using the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists. These prefix sums are used to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

The program then reads the queries and calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between the given cities. If the destination city is to the right of the source city, it uses the `pref_sum_f` list; otherwise, it uses the `pref_sum_b` list.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all the edge cases properly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
