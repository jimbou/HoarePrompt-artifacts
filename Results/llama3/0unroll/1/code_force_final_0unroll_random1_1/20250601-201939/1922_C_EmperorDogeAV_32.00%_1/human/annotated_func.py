    #State: Output State: `prog_cities` is a list with `n-1` elements, where each element at index `i` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i+1]` and `cities[i]`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `cities[i+1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i-1]` (or a very large negative number if `i` is 0).
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 elements, where each element at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between cities[i+1] and cities[i], depending on whether the absolute difference between cities[i+1] and cities[i] is less than the absolute difference between cities[i] and cities[i-1] (or a very large negative number if i is 0).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of distances between consecutive cities, comparing the distances to the previous city and the next city. It returns a list of n-1 elements, where each element at index i is either 1 (if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city) or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city. If the current city is the first city, the comparison is made with a very large negative number. The function takes a list of non-negative integers representing cities in ascending order and a non-negative integer n as input, where 0 <= n < len(cities).
