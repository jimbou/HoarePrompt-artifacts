Functionality: This function takes a list of non-negative integers in ascending order and a non-negative integer n as input, where 0 <= n < len(cities). It returns a list of n-1 elements, where each element at index i is either 1 or the absolute difference between cities[i+1] and cities[i], depending on whether the absolute difference between cities[i+1] and cities[i] is less than the absolute difference between cities[i] and cities[i-1] (or a very large negative number if i is 0).
