Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the closest city for each city in the list. It checks the distance to the previous city (if it exists) and the next city (if it exists) and chooses the one with the smaller distance. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1; otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

2. The program then calculates the prefix sum of the costs for traveling from the first city to each city in the list (`pref_sum_f`) and from the last city to each city in the list (`pref_sum_b`). This allows it to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling from one city to another.

3. For each query, the program checks if the destination city is to the right or left of the source city. If it's to the right, it calculates the total cost by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city (`pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1]`). If it's to the left, it does the same but with the prefix sum of the backward list (`pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1]`).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the source and destination cities are the same, when the destination city is to the right or left of the source city, and when the cities are at the beginning or end of the list.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
