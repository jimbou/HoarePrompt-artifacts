Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. 

The program first calculates the closest city for each city and stores the distances in the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. It then calculates the prefix sum of these distances to efficiently calculate the total distance between any two cities. 

The program handles the queries correctly by checking if the destination city is to the right or left of the source city and using the corresponding prefix sum to calculate the total distance. 

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the distances between consecutive cities and handles the edge cases where the current city is the first or last city. 

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
