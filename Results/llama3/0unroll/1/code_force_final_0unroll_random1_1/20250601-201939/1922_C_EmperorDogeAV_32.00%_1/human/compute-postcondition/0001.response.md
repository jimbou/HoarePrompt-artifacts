Output State: `prog_cities` is a list with `n-1` elements, where each element at index `i` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i+1]` and `cities[i]`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `cities[i+1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i-1]` (or a very large negative number if `i` is 0), respectively.
