This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer 't' representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers 'a' and 'b', and then determines whether a specific condition is met based on the parity of 'a' and 'b' and their difference. The function prints 'yes' if the condition is met and 'no' otherwise, repeating this process 't' times. The output will contain 't' lines, each containing either 'yes' or 'no'.
