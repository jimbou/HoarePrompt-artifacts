Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a x b rectangle. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when a = 3 and b = 1. The program will print 'yes', but the correct answer is 'no'. This is because the 3 x 1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1 x 1 rectangles, and from these, only the 1 x 2 and 2 x 1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same.

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where a and b are both odd. In this case, the program should check if a and b are both equal to 1, and if so, print 'no'. Otherwise, it should print 'yes'. 

The program also incorrectly handles the case where a and b are both even. In this case, the program should print 'yes' only if a and b are not both equal to 2. Otherwise, it should print 'no'.

The program's logic is also incorrect because it uses the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, which is always true, because `(a - b) % 2` is always either greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to 0. This condition does not correctly determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a x b rectangle.
