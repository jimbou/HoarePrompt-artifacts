Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking various conditions based on the parity of the input numbers `a` and `b`. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is incorrect. This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even, but it does not guarantee that a different rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 4`, this condition is true, but no different rectangle can be formed.

2. The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is also incorrect. This condition is checking if the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to the negative of one of the numbers, but this does not make sense in the context of the problem.

3. The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect. This condition is checking if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but this does not guarantee that a different rectangle can be formed.

4. The condition `else: print('no')` is also incorrect. This condition is printing 'no' if none of the above conditions are met, but this is not necessarily true.

A correct solution to the problem would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, no different rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
