You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of the list and n >= 3.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: The list will be modified such that all elements at even indices (0-based indexing) will be 0, and all elements at odd indices will be reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2. The value of n remains unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list and the value of n have been processed based on the condition specified by func_1(list, n). If func_1(list, n) returns True, the list is modified such that all elements at even indices are 0, and all elements at odd indices are reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2, and 'YES' is printed. If func_1(list, n) returns False, the list remains unchanged and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, the value of n remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The list has been modified such that all elements at even indices (0-based indexing) are 0, and all elements at odd indices have been reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2. The value of n remains unchanged. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) has returned True, indicating that the list and n have met the conditions specified by func_1, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: The list will not be modified such that all elements at even indices (0-based indexing) will be 0, and all elements at odd indices will not be reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2. The value of n remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition (func_1(list, n)) is false, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
