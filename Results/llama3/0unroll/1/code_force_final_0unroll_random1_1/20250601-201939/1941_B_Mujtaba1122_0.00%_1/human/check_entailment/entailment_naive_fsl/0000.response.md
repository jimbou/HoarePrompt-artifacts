Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by applying the operation, but it does not consider the condition that the operation can be applied any number of times.

For example, consider the input array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]. The program will output "NO" because it cannot make all elements zero by applying the operation only once. However, it is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation multiple times, as shown in the example provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of applying the operation multiple times.
