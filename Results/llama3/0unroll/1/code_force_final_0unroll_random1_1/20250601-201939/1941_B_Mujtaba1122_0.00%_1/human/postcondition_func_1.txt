This function modifies a list of non-negative integers based on a condition specified by the function func_1. If the condition is met, it sets all elements at even indices to 0 and reduces elements at odd indices by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2, and prints 'YES'. If the condition is not met, it leaves the list unchanged and prints 'NO'. The length of the list, represented by the variable n, remains unchanged in both cases.
