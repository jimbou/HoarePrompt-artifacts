Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements in the first n positions of the list are zero. If any non-zero element is found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

func_2 applies the operation to the list. It iterates over the list from the second element to the second last element. For each element, it checks if the element and its neighbors are greater than 0. If they are, it applies the operation by subtracting 1 from the neighbors and subtracting 2 from the current element, multiplied by the value of the previous element. This process is repeated until the current element is less than or equal to 1 or either of its neighbors is 0.

After applying the operation, func_2 calls func_1 to check if all elements in the list are zero. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In func_2, the operation is applied incorrectly. The correct operation should subtract 1 from the neighbors and subtract 2 from the current element, but the program multiplies the subtraction by the value of the previous element, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
