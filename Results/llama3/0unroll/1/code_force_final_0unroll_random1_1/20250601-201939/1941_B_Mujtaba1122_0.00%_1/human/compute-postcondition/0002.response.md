Postcondition: **The list has been modified such that all elements at even indices (0-based indexing) are 0, and all elements at odd indices have been reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2. The value of n remains unchanged. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) has returned True, indicating that the list and n have met the conditions specified by func_1.**
