Postcondition: **The list will not be modified such that all elements at even indices (0-based indexing) will be 0, and all elements at odd indices will not be reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2. The value of n remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition (func_1(list, n)) is false.**
