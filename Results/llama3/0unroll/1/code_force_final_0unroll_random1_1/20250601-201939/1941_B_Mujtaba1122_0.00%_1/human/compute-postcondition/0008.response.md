Postcondition: **The list and the value of n have been processed based on the condition specified by func_1(list, n). If func_1(list, n) returns True, the list is modified such that all elements at even indices are 0, and all elements at odd indices are reduced by the sum of all elements at even indices multiplied by 2, and 'YES' is printed. If func_1(list, n) returns False, the list remains unchanged and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, the value of n remains unchanged.**
