Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

Function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, which is the desired outcome.

Function `func_2` attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation. It does this by iterating over the list and applying the operation as long as the conditions are met (i.e., the current element is greater than 1, and the previous and next elements are greater than 0). After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a logical error in `func_2`. The operation is applied incorrectly. The correct operation should subtract 1 from the previous element, subtract 2 from the current element, and subtract 1 from the next element. But in the code, it subtracts the current element multiplied by the previous element from the current element, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
