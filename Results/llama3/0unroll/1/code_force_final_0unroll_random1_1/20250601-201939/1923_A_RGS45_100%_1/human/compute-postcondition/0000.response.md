The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. The integer `t` is assigned to the variable `t`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains `t` test cases, we will include it in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1).**
