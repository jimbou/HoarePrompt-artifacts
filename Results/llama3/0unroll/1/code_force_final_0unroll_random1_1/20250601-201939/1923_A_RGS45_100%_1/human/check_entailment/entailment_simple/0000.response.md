Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of 0s and 1s representing the cells.
3. It finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (`x`) and the index of the last occurrence of '1' (`y`) by reversing the string and finding the first occurrence of '1'.
4. It extracts the substring `z` from the original string, starting from the first occurrence of '1' (`x`) to the end of the string minus the index of the last occurrence of '1' (`y`). This effectively gives the substring containing all the chips.
5. It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` and prints it. This is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block. It handles the edge cases where all chips are already in a single block (e.g., the third example) and where there are no chips (not mentioned in the problem statement, but the program will still work correctly).

Correctness: **True**
