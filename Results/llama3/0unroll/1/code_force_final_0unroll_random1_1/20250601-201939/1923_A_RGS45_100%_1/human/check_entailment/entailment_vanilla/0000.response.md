Reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration `arr` as a string of '0's and '1's.

3. It finds the index of the first '1' from the left (`x`) and the index of the first '1' from the right (`y`). The ribbon configuration is then sliced from the first '1' to the last '1' (`z = arr[x:n - y]`).

4. Finally, it counts the number of '0's in the sliced configuration `z` and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. By slicing the configuration from the first '1' to the last '1', it effectively removes any leading or trailing '0's that do not affect the minimum number of operations. The count of '0's in the sliced configuration is then the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Correctness: **True**
