Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of moving chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program works by finding the first and last occurrences of '1' in the input string, which represents the chips. It then extracts the substring between these two indices and counts the number of '0's in this substring, which represents the free cells that need to be moved.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are no free cells between the chips (e.g., "111111")
* When there are free cells between the chips (e.g., "101010")
* When there are free cells at the beginning or end of the ribbon (e.g., "001111" or "111100")

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* When the input string contains only one '1' (e.g., "100000")
* When the input string contains only '0's (e.g., "000000")

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
