You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, end is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, num is a list of all v values where t is 3, stdin is empty.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, `num` is a list of all v values where t is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, stdin is empty.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, `num` is a list of all v values where t is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, stdin is empty, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of start and end values and the count of numbers within that range, or 0 if the count of numbers is greater than or equal to the range. The start value is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, the end value is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, and the count of numbers is the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range [start, end]. The range of start and end values is at least 1 and at most 99, since n is an integer between 2 and 100.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between the range of start and end values and the count of numbers within that range, or 0 if the count of numbers is greater than or equal to the range. The start value is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, the end value is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, and the count of numbers is the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range [start, end]. The range of start and end values is at least 1 and at most 99, since n is an integer between 2 and 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
