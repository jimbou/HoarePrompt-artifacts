This function takes a boolean value `space` and another boolean value `to_int` as input, reads a line of input, and processes it based on these values. If `space` is true, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the line as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers; otherwise, it returns them as strings. The function returns a list of either integers or strings, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
