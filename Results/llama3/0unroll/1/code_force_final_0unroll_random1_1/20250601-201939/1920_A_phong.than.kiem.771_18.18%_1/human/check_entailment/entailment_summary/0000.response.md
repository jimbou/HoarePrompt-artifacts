Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where Alex has n constraints on what the integer k can be. There are three types of constraints: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x, k must be less than or equal to some integer x, and k must be not equal to some integer x. The program is supposed to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is in function 7 (func_7). This function reads the number of constraints (n) and then processes each constraint. It keeps track of the start and end values of the range of possible k values and also stores the numbers that k cannot be equal to. Finally, it calculates the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of numbers that k cannot be equal to from the total range of possible k values.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program is correctly implemented. Function 1 (func_1) reads the number of test cases, function 2 (func_2) reads the input for each test case, and function 7 (func_7) processes the input and calculates the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
