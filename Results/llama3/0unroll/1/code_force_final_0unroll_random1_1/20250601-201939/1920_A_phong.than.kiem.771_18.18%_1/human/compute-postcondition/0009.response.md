Output State: **The program returns the difference between the range of start and end values and the count of numbers within that range, or 0 if the count of numbers is greater than or equal to the range. The start value is the maximum of the initial start and all v values where t is 1, the end value is the minimum of the initial end and all v values where t is 2, and the count of numbers is the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range [start, end]. The range of start and end values is at least 1 and at most 99, since n is an integer between 2 and 100.**
