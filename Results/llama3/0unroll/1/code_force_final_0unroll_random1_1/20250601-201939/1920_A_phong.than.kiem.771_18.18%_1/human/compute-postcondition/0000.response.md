The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 100. The second line assigns -1 to `start`. The third line assigns 1000000000.0 to `end`. The fourth line creates an empty list called `num`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines, each containing two integers t and v.**
