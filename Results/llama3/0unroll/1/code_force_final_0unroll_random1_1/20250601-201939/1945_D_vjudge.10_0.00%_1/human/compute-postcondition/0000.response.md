Output State: **x is an integer equal to the number of test cases, custos is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input: the first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the second line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

Explanation: The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first line of input to `x`. Since each test case contains three lines of input, and the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, `x` becomes equal to the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list `custos`. No other variables are affected. The remaining input lines are still in stdin, with each test case containing two lines of input: the first line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the second line contains `n` integers `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
