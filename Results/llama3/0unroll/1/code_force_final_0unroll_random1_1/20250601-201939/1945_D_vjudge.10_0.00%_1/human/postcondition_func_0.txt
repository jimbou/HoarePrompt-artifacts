This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines of input: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_1 to a_n, and n integers b_1 to b_n. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case by iterating through the integers from n to m, comparing a_i and b_i, and adding the smaller value to the cost. If a_i is smaller, it adds a_i to the cost; otherwise, it adds b_i. Then, it iterates from m to 1, comparing a_(i-1) + b_i with a_i, and adds the smaller value to the cost. If a_(i-1) + b_i is smaller, it adds b_i to the cost; otherwise, it adds a_i. The function stores the minimum cost for each test case in a list and prints each cost to the console.
