Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach his desired position in the queue. 

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the cost of moving to a position. The program only considers the cost of moving to the position immediately before the current position, but it does not consider the cost of moving to positions further ahead.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

The program will calculate the cost of moving to position 2 as 14 (7 + 4 + 3), but it does not consider the cost of moving to position 1, which would be 3 (the cost of bribing the person at position 1). Therefore, the program will output 14, but the correct answer is 3.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider the cost of moving to all positions ahead of the current position, not just the position immediately before.
