Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates through the input values from n to m, comparing a_i and b_i, and adds the smaller value to the cost. Then, it iterates from m to 1, comparing a_(i-1) + b_i with a_i, and adds the smaller value to the cost. This approach ensures that Kirill spends the minimum number of coins to reach a position among the first m people in line.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when a_i is smaller than b_i, and when a_(i-1) + b_i is smaller than a_i. The use of a list to store the minimum cost for each test case and printing each cost to the console is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
