Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in the queue.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the values of a_i and b_i for each person.

2. The program initializes the cost (custo) to 0 for each test case.

3. The program iterates from the end of the queue (num_fila - 1) to the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (max_p - 1), and for each position, it checks if the cost of bribing the person at that position (a_values[y]) is less than the cost of bribing all the people between the current position and the maximum allowable final position (b_values[y]). If it is, the program adds the cost of bribing the person at that position to the total cost. Otherwise, it adds the cost of bribing all the people between the current position and the maximum allowable final position.

4. The program then iterates from the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (max_p - 1) to the beginning of the queue (0), and for each position, it checks if the cost of bribing the person at that position plus the cost of bribing the person at the next position is less than or equal to the cost of bribing the person at the next position. If it is, the program adds the cost of bribing the person at the next position to the total cost. If it's not, the program adds the cost of bribing the person at that position to the total cost and breaks the loop.

5. The program appends the total cost for each test case to the list custos.

6. Finally, the program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
