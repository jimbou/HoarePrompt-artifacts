Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The issue lies in the way the program handles the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) calculation.

In the program, the MEX is calculated as the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. However, this calculation is not correct. The MEX should be calculated as the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array up to the current index i.

For example, consider the input array a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]. The program calculates the MEX as [0, 1, 4, 2, 3], but the correct MEX should be [0, 1, 3, 2, 4].

To fix this issue, the program should keep track of the elements that have been used up to the current index i and calculate the MEX accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    used = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(min(j for j in range(n) if j not in used))
            used.add(mex[-1])
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - min(j for j in range(n) if j not in used)))
            used.add(mex[-1])
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

This corrected program calculates the MEX correctly and constructs the permutation p based on the given array a.
