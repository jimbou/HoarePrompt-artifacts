This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum excluded value (mex) for each iteration of the loop. It takes no arguments and returns None. The function's purpose is to calculate and display the mex values based on the input array. The final state of the program is that the mex values are printed to the console, and the input variables (n, arr, mex, minn, and used) remain unchanged after the function concludes.
