To calculate the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the state.

The loop iterates over a list of integers `mex`. For each integer `itm` in `mex`, it prints the value of `itm` followed by a space.

The initial state includes a list of integers representing the minimum excluded value (mex) for each iteration of the loop and a dictionary `used` that keeps track of the used values. The variable `minn` is updated to the next available minimum excluded value after each iteration.

Since the loop only prints the values of `itm` and does not modify the list `mex`, the dictionary `used`, or the variable `minn`, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The list of integers representing the minimum excluded value (mex) for each iteration of the loop remains unchanged, and the dictionary (used) that keeps track of the used values remains unchanged. The variable minn remains unchanged as well.**
