Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. The program correctly initializes the necessary variables: it initializes an empty list `mex` to store the minimum excluded values, a variable `minn` to keep track of the current minimum excluded value, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values.

3. The program correctly calculates the minimum excluded values: it iterates over the array, and for each element, it checks if the element is positive. If it is, it appends the current minimum excluded value to the `mex` list, marks the current minimum excluded value as used, and updates the minimum excluded value to the next available one. If the element is not positive, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum excluded value to the `mex` list, marks this value as used, and updates the minimum excluded value to the next available one.

4. The program correctly prints the output: it prints the minimum excluded values for each iteration of the loop, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline character.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains negative numbers: it correctly calculates the minimum excluded values even when the array contains negative numbers.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains zeros: it correctly calculates the minimum excluded values even when the array contains zeros.

7. The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains duplicate numbers: it correctly calculates the minimum excluded values even when the array contains duplicate numbers.

8. The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains numbers that are equal to the length of the array: it correctly calculates the minimum excluded values even when the array contains numbers that are equal to the length of the array.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
