Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It iterates through the input array and calculates the MEX (minimum excluded value) for each element.
3.  If the current element is positive, it appends the current MEX to the `mex` list and updates the `used` dictionary to mark the MEX as used. It then increments the MEX until it finds an unused value.
4.  If the current element is negative, it calculates the absolute difference between the current MEX and the absolute value of the current element. This difference is the actual value that should be appended to the `mex` list. It then updates the `used` dictionary to mark this value as used.
5.  Finally, it prints the calculated MEX values.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles both positive and negative values in the input array correctly. The use of the `used` dictionary ensures that each value in the `mex` list is unique, which is a requirement for the MEX calculation.

Correctness: **True**
