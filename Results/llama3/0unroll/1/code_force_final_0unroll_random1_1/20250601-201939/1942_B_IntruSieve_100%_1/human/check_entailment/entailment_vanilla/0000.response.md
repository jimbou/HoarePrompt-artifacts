Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Initialize an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation.
2. Initialize a variable `minn` to 0, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
3. Initialize an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.
4. Iterate through the array `a`. For each element `a_i`:
   - If `a_i` is positive, append `minn` to the `mex` list and mark `minn` as used. Then, increment `minn` until it finds a number that has not been used.
   - If `a_i` is negative, append `abs(a_i - minn)` to the `mex` list and mark `abs(a_i - minn)` as used.
5. Print the constructed permutation `mex`.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the constructed permutation satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`. The use of the `used` dictionary and the `minn` variable ensures that the permutation is constructed greedily, always choosing the smallest available number that satisfies the condition.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly. It should take no arguments, but it is called without any arguments in the main loop. To fix this, the function definition should be changed to `def func_1():`.

Correctness: **True**
