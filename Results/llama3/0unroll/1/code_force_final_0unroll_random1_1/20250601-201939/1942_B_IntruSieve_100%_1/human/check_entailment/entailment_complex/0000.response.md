Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses a loop to iterate through the array `a` and calculates the minimum excluded value (mex) for each iteration. It then prints the mex values to the console.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem's requirements. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the mex values, a variable `minn` to keep track of the next available minimum excluded value, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values. The loop iterates through the array `a`, and for each element, it checks if the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current `minn` value to the `mex` list and updates `minn` to the next available minimum excluded value. If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to the `mex` list and updates `minn` accordingly.

The program's output is correct, and it prints the mex values for each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is that the mex values are printed to the console, and the input variables (`n`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `used`) remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Correctness: **True**
