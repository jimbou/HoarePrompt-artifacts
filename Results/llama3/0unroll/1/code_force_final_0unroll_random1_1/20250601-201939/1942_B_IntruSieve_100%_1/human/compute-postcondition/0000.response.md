Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (length of the array), then a list of integers (the array)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer, which is the number of test cases. The variable `arr` is a list of integers, which is the array for the first test case. The variable `mex` is an empty list, which will be used to store the minimum excluded values for each test case. The variable `minn` is 0, which is the minimum excluded value for the first test case. The variable `used` is an empty dictionary, which will be used to keep track of the used values for each test case. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for the remaining test cases, each consisting of an integer (length of the array) followed by a list of integers (the array).
