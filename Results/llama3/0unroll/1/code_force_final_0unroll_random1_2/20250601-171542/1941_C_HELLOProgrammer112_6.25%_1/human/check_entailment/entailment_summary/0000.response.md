Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s and prints their sum for each test case. This is because the problem statement requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful, and the program achieves this by counting the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' and printing their sum.

The program's logic is sound because it correctly identifies the substrings 'map' and 'pie' as the ones that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. By counting their occurrences, the program is effectively counting the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program also handles the edge case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., it does not contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie') correctly. In this case, the program will print 0, which is the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
