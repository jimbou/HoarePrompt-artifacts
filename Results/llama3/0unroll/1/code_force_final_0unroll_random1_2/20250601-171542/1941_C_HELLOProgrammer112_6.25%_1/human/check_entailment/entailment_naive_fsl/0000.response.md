Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string "map" and "pie" overlap. For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings, but in reality, it should be counted as one, because removing one character can make the string beautiful. 

In the given program, the count function is used to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, which does not consider the overlap between them. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
