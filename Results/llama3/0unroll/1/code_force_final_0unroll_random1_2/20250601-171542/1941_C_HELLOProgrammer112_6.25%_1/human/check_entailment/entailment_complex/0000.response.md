Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s, and prints their sum for each test case.

The program uses the `count()` method of the string class to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie', which is an efficient and accurate way to do so. The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the number of test cases and the strings for each test case, and printing the results for each test case.

The program's logic is also correct. It correctly identifies the substrings 'map' and 'pie' as the ones that make a string ugly, and it correctly counts the occurrences of these substrings in each string s. The program then prints the sum of these counts, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
