Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints the ceiling of k divided by 2 for each test case, except when k is equal to 4n - 2, in which case it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The function produces t lines of output, each containing a single integer, and leaves the input variable t unchanged.**
