Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell.

The program first checks if k is equal to 4n - 2, which is the total number of diagonals in the grid. In this case, it prints k // 2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover all diagonals.

If k is not equal to 4n - 2, the program prints ceil(k / 2), which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals. The ceil function is used to round up to the nearest integer, because we can't color a fraction of a cell.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
