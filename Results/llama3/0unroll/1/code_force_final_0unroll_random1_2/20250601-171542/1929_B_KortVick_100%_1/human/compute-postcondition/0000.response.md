The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first line of input to `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining lines of input are still in stdin, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**
