Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 3, the program outputs 2, but the correct answer is 2. However, when n = 3 and k = 9, the program outputs 5, but the correct answer is 5. But when n = 4 and k = 7 the program outputs 4, but the correct answer is 4.
