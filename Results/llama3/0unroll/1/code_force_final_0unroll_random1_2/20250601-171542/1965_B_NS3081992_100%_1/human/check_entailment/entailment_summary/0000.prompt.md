Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list, ensuring the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, both of which are positive.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_3()'. The function takes a positive integer 'rows_number' as input and returns a list of that length, with each element being the result of a separate call to 'func_3()'.

Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from the standard input, removes trailing bytes, decodes it into a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  Reads a line of input from stdin, expecting a space-separated list of two integers, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  This function generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The function accepts a non-negative integer 'rows' as input and returns the generated list. The final state of the program is a list containing 'rows' number of elements, with each element being the result of a separate call to 'func_7()'.
Function number 9 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function9:  Reads a string from standard input and returns it unchanged.
Function number 10 :

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as is, without performing any modifications or actions on the input value.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  Reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):

        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, integer `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each element `di` in `d[da]`, checks if `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and if so, recursively calls `func_12` to update a temporary value `tmp`. The function then updates `rank[da - 1]` with the minimum value of `tmp` plus 1 and returns this value. The function modifies the `rank` list and returns an integer value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0

    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)

''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b, where b is not equal to 0 and a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are the integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, to compute the GCD and coefficients.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:

        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)

            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of input integers n and k, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and appends additional values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The function does not modify the input values n and k.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function writes a sequence of strings to the standard output, where the number of strings is determined by the return value of func_10() and each string is the return value of func_14(). The strings are separated by newline characters.
