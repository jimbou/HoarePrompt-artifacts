Functionality: **This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of input integers n and k, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and appends additional values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The function does not modify the input values n and k.**
