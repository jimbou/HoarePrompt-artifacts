This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b, where b is not equal to 0 and a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are the integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, to compute the GCD and coefficients.
