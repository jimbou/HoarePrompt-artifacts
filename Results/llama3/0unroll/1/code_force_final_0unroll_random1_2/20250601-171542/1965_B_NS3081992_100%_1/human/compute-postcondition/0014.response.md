Functionality: This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of two input integers, n and k, where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and appends three additional values: k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The function then returns a string containing the length of this list and its elements.
