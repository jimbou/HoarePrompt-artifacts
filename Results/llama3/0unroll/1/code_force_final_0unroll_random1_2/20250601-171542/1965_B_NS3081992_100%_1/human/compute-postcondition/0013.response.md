Output State: **The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of 'n' plus 3, and the elements of 'ans' are the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of 'n', 'k', 'b', 'l', 'bk', and 'lk' remain unchanged.**
