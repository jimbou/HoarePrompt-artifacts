You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns a string '1\n2' where '1' is the current value of k and '2' is the current value of n.
        #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is currently equal to 1, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: The value of ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), where lk is the number of digits in the binary representation of k. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: The value of ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the additional values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
    #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1, n is not equal to 2. Otherwise, the value of ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the additional values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of 'n' plus 3, and the elements of 'ans' are the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of 'n', 'k', 'b', 'l', 'bk', and 'lk' remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is currently equal to 1, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2

Case_2: The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of 'n' plus 3, and the elements of 'ans' are the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of 'n', 'k', 'b', 'l', 'bk', and 'lk' remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
