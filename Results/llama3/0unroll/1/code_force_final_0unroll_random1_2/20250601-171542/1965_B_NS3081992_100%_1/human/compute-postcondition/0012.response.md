Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1, n is not equal to 2. Otherwise, the value of ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the additional values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1. The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.***
