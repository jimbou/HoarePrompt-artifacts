Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, integer `da`, and list `rank`. If the length of the list `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each element `di` in `d[da]`, checks if `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and if so, recursively calls `func_12` to update a temporary value `tmp`. The function then updates `rank[da - 1]` with the minimum value of `tmp` plus 1 and returns this value. The function modifies the `rank` list and returns an integer value.

Note that a is larger or equal to b, and b is larger or equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b, where b is not equal to 0 and a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are the integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, to compute the GCD and coefficients.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of input integers n and k, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'.
