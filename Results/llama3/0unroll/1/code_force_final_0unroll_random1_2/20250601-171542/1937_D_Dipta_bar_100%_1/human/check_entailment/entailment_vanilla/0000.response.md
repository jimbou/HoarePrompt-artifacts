Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of pinballs that have moved to the left and right, respectively.

The program first initializes the arrays A and B by iterating through the input string s. For each character '<', it calculates the cumulative sum of the number of pinballs that have moved to the left and stores it in array A. Similarly, for each character '>', it calculates the cumulative sum of the number of pinballs that have moved to the right and stores it in array B.

Then, the program iterates through the input string s again and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell. It uses the values stored in arrays A and B to calculate the number of seconds.

The program handles the cases where the pinball is placed on the leftmost or rightmost cell separately. If the pinball is placed on the leftmost cell, it simply prints the length of the grid. If the pinball is placed on the rightmost cell, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by using the values stored in array B.

The program also handles the cases where the pinball is placed on a cell that is not on the leftmost or rightmost cell. It uses the values stored in arrays A and B to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

Correctness: **True**
