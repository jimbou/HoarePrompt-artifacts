Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell. The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sums of the distances from each cell to the previous '<' and '>' characters, respectively. It then uses these lists to calculate the total distance for each cell.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball is placed on the first or last cell, or when there are no '<' or '>' characters before or after the current cell. The program also correctly handles the case when the pinball moves in the opposite direction of the '<' or '>' character.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
