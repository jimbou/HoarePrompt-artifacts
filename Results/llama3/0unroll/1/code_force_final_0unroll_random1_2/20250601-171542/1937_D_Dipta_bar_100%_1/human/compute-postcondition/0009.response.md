Functionality: **The function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The sequence is calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. For each character in the string, the function calculates a value based on the positions of the previous '<' and '>' characters and prints this value. The function effectively calculates and prints the sum of the distances from each character to the previous '<' and '>' characters, multiplied by the number of '<' and '>' characters encountered so far, plus the position of the character in the string.**
