Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the number of pinballs that have moved to the right and left, respectively, up to each index. It also initializes two lists, idx_A and idx_B, to store the indices of the cells where the pinballs are placed.

The program then iterates over the string s from left to right and right to left, respectively, and updates the lists A and B accordingly. It also updates the indices l and r to keep track of the current position of the pinballs.

Finally, the program iterates over the string s again and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. It uses the lists A and B to calculate the number of pinballs that have moved to the right and left, respectively, up to each index, and adds the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to move from the current index to the boundary of the grid.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball is placed at the boundary of the grid and where the pinball moves to the left or right.

Correctness: **True**
