Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative sums of the distances from each '<' and '>' character to the previous '<' and '>' characters, respectively. It also uses two indices, idx_A and idx_B, to keep track of the positions of the '<' and '>' characters.

The program then iterates through the string s, and for each character, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of the previous '<' and '>' characters. It uses the values stored in arrays A and B, as well as the indices idx_A and idx_B, to calculate the time.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the pinball is placed on the first or last character of the string, or when there are no '<' or '>' characters before or after the current character.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program is working correctly, as it prints the expected output for the given input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
