Output State: **B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of integers, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, l is 0, r is the length of B.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `l` and `r`. The first line sets `l` to 0, and the second line sets `r` to the length of the list `B`. These assignments do not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. The final state includes the new values of `l` and `r`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
