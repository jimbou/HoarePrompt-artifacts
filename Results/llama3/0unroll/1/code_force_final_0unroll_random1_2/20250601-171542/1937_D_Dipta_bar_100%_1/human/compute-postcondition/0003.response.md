Output State: **A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code initializes two new lists, B and idx_B, both of which are empty. The existing variables A, idx_A, s, and n are not modified by the code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
