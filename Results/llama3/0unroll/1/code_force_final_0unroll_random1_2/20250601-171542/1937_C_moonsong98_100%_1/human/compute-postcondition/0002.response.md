Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and equals 2, and the function `func_2` has been called with arguments 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as 2, and the function `func_2` has been executed with the arguments 0 and 1. Since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its effects on the program state. However, we can conclude that the function has been called with the specified arguments.
