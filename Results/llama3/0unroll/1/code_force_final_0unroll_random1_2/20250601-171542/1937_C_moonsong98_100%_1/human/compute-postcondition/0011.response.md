Output State: **`max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` is unchanged and still larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `min_index` is the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', stdin still contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `min_index` has been updated to be the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<'. The values of `max_index`, `n`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
