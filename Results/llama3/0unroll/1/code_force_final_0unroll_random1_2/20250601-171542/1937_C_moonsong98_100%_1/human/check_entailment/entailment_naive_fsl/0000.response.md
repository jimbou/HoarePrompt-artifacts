Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

The program first checks if the length of the sequence is 2, in which case it directly prints the answer as 0 and 1. 

For sequences of length greater than 2, it first finds the index of the maximum element in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. 

Then, it finds the indices of the minimum elements in the sequence by comparing each element with the current minimum. 

Finally, it finds the index of the minimum element that has the maximum XOR with the maximum element by comparing each minimum element with the current minimum. 

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. 

The program also handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices that have the maximum XOR, by finding the first such pair. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
