Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a query-based approach, where it asks queries in the form of "? a b c d" and receives the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d) as "<", "=", or ">".

The program first finds the maximum index max_index by comparing (p_0 | p_max_index) with (p_0 | p_i) for all i. It then finds the minimum index min_index by comparing (p_max_index | p_min_index) with (p_max_index | p_i) for all i.

Finally, it calls the func_2 function with max_index and min_index to print the result in the format "! max_index min_index".

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum and minimum indices and uses the query-based approach to compare the values. It also handles the case when n is 2 separately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
