The function takes no parameters and returns a string that is the next line of input from the user, with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The function also prints a query string to the standard output in the format '? a b c d' (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than the number of elements in the secret sequence p) and waits for the user's response.
