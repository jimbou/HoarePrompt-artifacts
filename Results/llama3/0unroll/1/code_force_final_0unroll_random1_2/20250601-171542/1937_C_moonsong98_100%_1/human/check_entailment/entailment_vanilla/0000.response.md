Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i` XOR `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a combination of queries to the jury to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Function `func_1` is used to ask a query to the jury, comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements. It prints the query and reads the response from the jury.
2. Function `func_2` is used to print the final answer, which is the pair of indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i` XOR `p_j`.
3. Function `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the length of the sequence `n` from the input. If `n` is 2, it immediately prints the answer as `0 1`, since the XOR of any two elements in a sequence of length 2 is maximized.
4. If `n` is greater than 2, the function finds the index `max_index` that corresponds to the maximum element in the sequence. This is done by iterating over the sequence and asking queries to the jury to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements.
5. Once `max_index` is found, the function finds the indices `min_indices` that correspond to the minimum elements in the sequence. This is done by asking queries to the jury to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements, using `max_index` as a reference.
6. The function then finds the index `min_index` that corresponds to the minimum element in the sequence, by asking queries to the jury to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements, using the elements in `min_indices` as references.
7. Finally, the function prints the answer as `max_index` and `min_index`, which are the indices that maximize `p_i` XOR `p_j`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries to the jury, which is within the allowed limit. The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct answer for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
