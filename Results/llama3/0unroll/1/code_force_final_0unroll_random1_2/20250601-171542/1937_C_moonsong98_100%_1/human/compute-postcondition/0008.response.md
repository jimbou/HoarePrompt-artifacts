Output State: **`max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` is unchanged and still larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`, stdin still contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `max_index` remains the same as it was before the code execution, which is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. The value of `n` also remains unchanged and is still larger than 0 and not equal to 2. A new variable `min_indices` is introduced, which is a list containing the value of `max_index`. The stdin still contains no input.
