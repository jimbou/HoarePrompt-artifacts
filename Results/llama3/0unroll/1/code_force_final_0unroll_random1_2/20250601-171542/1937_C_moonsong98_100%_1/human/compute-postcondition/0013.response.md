Output State: `min_index` is the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` is unchanged and still larger than 0 and not equal to 2, stdin still contains no input.
