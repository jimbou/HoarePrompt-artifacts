Output State: **`min_index` is the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' or '<', `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `n` is unchanged and still larger than 0 and not equal to 2, stdin still contains no input, and `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been executed.**

The code executes the function `func_2` with the arguments `max_index` and `min_index`, but the specific effect of this function on the program state is unknown. Therefore, the output state includes the execution of `func_2(max_index, min_index)`, but the values of the variables `min_index`, `min_indices`, `max_index`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
