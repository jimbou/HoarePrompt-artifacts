Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by calculating the time it takes for the car to reach each query point d. The program first calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the arrays a and b, which represent the distances and times between consecutive signs. It then uses these differences to calculate the speed of the car between each pair of signs.

For each query point d, the program uses binary search to find the index s such that a[s-1] < d <= a[s]. It then calculates the time it takes for the car to reach point d by interpolating between the times b[s-1] and b[s] based on the distance d - a[s-1] and the speed between the signs.

The program handles the case where d is equal to one of the signs (i.e., a[s] == d) correctly by printing the corresponding time b[s] directly.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
