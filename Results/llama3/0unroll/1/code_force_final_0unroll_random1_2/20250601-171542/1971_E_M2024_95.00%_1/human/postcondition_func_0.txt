This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in a_i and b_i, and then for each query d, it finds the corresponding value in b_i by interpolating between the closest elements in a_i and b_i. The function prints the calculated values for each query, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline character after each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
