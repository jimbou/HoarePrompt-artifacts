You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines each with a single integer d. n, k, and q are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ad = [0]
        
        bd = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
        
        v = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
        
        for l in range(q):
            m = 0
            i = 1
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m += b[s - 1]
            m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        
        print()
        
    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables after the last iteration. The variable 't' is still an integer, but its value has been decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The stdin contains no more test cases. The variables 'n', 'k', 'q', 'a', 'b', 'ad', 'bd', 'v', 'm', 'i', 'ql', and 's' have been updated with the values from the last test case. The variable 'm' holds the final calculated value for the last query in the last test case. The variable 'i' is still 1, and 'ql' and 's' hold the values from the last query in the last test case. The variable 'v' holds the calculated values for the last test case. The variables 'ad' and 'bd' hold the differences between consecutive elements in 'a' and 'b' respectively, for the last test case. The variable 'b' holds the last calculated value for the last query in the last test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
