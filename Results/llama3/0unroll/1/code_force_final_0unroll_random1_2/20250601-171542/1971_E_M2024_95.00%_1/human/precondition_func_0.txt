stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines each with a single integer d. n, k, and q are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
