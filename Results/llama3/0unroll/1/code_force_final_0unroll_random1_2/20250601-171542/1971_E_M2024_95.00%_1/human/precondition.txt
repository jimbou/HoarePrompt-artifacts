stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input: the first line contains three integers n, k, and q, the second line contains k integers a_i, the third line contains k integers b_i, and the following q lines contain single integers d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n. d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
