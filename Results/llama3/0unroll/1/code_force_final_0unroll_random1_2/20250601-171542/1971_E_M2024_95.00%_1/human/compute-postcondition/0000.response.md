Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines each with a single integer d. n, k, and q are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n and 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain four inputs each: three integers n, k, and q, followed by k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines with a single integer d. The constraints on the values of n, k, q, a_i, b_i, and d remain the same as in the initial state.
