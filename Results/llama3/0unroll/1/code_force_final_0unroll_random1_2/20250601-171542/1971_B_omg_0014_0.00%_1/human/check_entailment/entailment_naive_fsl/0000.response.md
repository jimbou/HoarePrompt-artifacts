Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", the program will output "YES" and a sorted version of the string, but this is not a valid solution because the sorted string is the same as the original string. The problem statement requires that the rearranged string be different from the original string.

In this case, the program should output "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange the characters of "aaaaa" to form a different string.
