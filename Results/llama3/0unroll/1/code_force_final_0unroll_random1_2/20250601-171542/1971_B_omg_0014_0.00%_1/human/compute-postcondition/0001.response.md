Output State: **The output will contain n lines. For each string s in the input, if s has more than two distinct characters, the output will contain 'YES' followed by the string s in sorted order if s is already sorted, otherwise it will be followed by the string s in reverse sorted order. If s has exactly two distinct characters, the output will contain 'NO'. The value of n remains unchanged.**
