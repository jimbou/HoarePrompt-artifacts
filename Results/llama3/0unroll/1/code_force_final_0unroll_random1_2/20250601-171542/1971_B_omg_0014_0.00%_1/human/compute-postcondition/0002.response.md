Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings. It then checks each string to determine if it contains more than two distinct characters. If a string has more than two distinct characters, the function prints 'YES' followed by the string in sorted order if it is already sorted, otherwise it prints the string in reverse sorted order. If a string has exactly two distinct characters, the function prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all t strings, leaving the input integer t unchanged.**
