Functionality: **This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input and outputs the number of alternating sequences of 0s and 1s in each string, with a special case where if a string starts with 0 and ends with 1, it decrements the count by 1. The function processes multiple strings as specified by an initial integer input, and the input strings and the count of strings remain unchanged.**
