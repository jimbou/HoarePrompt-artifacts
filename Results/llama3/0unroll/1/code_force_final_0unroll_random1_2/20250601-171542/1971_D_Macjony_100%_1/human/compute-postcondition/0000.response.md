Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which was read from the input. The stdin still contains the t strings s, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, which were not affected by the code.
