#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers each less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: res is the number of distinct non-negative integers in list a, count is an empty dictionary.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of distinct non-negative integers in list 'a'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of distinct integers in the list. It does not modify the input list. The function effectively counts the unique non-negative integers in the list, ignoring duplicates.
