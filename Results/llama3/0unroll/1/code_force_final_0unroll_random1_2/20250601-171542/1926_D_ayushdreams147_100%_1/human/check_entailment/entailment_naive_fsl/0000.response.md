Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition. The function `func_1` iterates over the input list `a` and for each number, it checks if its bitwise complement (i.e., the number with all bits flipped) is already present in the `count` dictionary. If it is, it means that the current number can be paired with its complement, so it increments the result `res` and decrements the count of the complement in the dictionary. If the complement is not present, it adds the current number to the dictionary with a count of 1 and increments the result `res`.

The program correctly handles the case where a number is its own complement (i.e., the number with all bits set to 1), by treating it as a special case and not incrementing the result `res` in this case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list `a` contains duplicate numbers, by not counting them multiple times in the `count` dictionary.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
