This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of colored cells required to satisfy the condition for each test case, based on the given grid size and diagonal requirements.
