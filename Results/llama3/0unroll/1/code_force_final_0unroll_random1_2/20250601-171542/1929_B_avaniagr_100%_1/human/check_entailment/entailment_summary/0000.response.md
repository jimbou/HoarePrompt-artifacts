Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases and the grid size (`n`) and diagonal requirements (`k`) for each test case.
2.  It then applies the correct logic to calculate the minimum number of colored cells required based on the given conditions:

    *   If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it calculates the minimum number of colored cells as the ceiling of `k / 2`. This is because each colored cell can cover two diagonals, so the minimum number of cells required is half of the total diagonals needed, rounded up to the nearest whole number.
    *   If `k` is equal to `4 * n - 3`, it sets the minimum number of colored cells to `2 * n - 1`. This is a special case where one diagonal is already covered, so the remaining diagonals require `2 * n - 1` cells.
    *   If `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, it sets the minimum number of colored cells to `2 * n`. This is another special case where all diagonals need to be covered, requiring `2 * n` cells.
3.  The program prints the calculated minimum number of colored cells for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
