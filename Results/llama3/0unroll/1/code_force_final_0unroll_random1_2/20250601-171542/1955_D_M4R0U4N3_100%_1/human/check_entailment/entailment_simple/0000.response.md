Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the values of n, m, k, and the lists a and b.

2. It initializes a count array cnt_b to keep track of the count of each element in list b. This is necessary to efficiently check if an element in list a is present in list b.

3. It then iterates over the list a with a sliding window of size m. For each window, it checks if the current window contains at least k elements from list b. If it does, it increments the answer.

4. The program correctly updates the count array cnt_b when moving the sliding window to the right. It increments the count of the element that is no longer in the window and decrements the count of the new element that is now in the window.

5. After processing each test case, the program resets the count array cnt_b to its initial state, which is necessary to process the next test case correctly.

6. The program correctly outputs the answer for each test case, which is the number of subarrays of length m that contain at least k elements from list b.

Correctness: **True**
