Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of subarrays of length m in list a that contain at least k elements from list b.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes a count array `cnt_b` to keep track of the count of each element in list b. This is done to efficiently check if an element in list a is present in list b.

2. For each test case, the program reads the input values n, m, and k, and the lists a and b.

3. It then initializes a set `b_values` to store the unique elements in list b. This is done to efficiently check if an element in list a is present in list b.

4. The program then initializes the answer variable `ans` to 0 and the current count `curr` to 0.

5. It then processes the first window of length m in list a. For each element in the window, it checks if the element is present in list b. If it is, it decrements the count of the element in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.

6. If `curr` is greater than or equal to k, it increments `ans` by 1.

7. The program then slides the window to the right by one element. For each element that is removed from the window, it increments the count of the element in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive. For each element that is added to the window, it decrements the count of the element in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.

8. If `curr` is greater than or equal to k, it increments `ans` by 1.

9. The program repeats steps 7 and 8 until the end of list a is reached.

10. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of subarrays of length m in list a that contain at least k elements from list b.

11. The program then resets the count array `cnt_b` to its initial state for the next test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the sliding window approach to solve the problem, and its output is correct for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
