Output State: **The loop will output the number of subarrays of length m that contain at least k elements from the list b, for each test case. The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of such subarrays for a particular test case. The state of the other variables, such as cnt_b, will be reset to their initial values after each test case.**
