Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then calculates and prints the number of subarrays of length m in list a that contain at least k elements from list b. The function processes each test case independently, resetting its internal state after each case, and outputs the result for each test case as an integer.**
