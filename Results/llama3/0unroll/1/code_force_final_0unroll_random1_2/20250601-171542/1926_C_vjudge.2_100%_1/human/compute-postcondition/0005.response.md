Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t integers. For each integer n, it calculates and prints the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to n. The function uses a precomputed list pd to efficiently calculate this sum, where pd[i] is the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to i. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input stream empty.**
