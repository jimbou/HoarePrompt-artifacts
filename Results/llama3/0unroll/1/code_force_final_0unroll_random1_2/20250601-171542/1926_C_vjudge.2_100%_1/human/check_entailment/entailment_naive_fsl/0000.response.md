Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a prefix sum array `pd` to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `N`, where `N` is the maximum possible value of `n`. This allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of the digit sums for any given `n` by simply looking up the value in the `pd` array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, and the large case where `n` is 200000. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is a large number with many digits, as it uses a prefix sum array to avoid having to recalculate the sum of the digit sums for each number.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
