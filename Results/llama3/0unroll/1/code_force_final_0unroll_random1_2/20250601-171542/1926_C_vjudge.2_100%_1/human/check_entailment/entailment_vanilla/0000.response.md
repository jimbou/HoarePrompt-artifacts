Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 and stores it in the `pd` array.

2. The program first initializes the `pd` array with zeros and then calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5. It does this by iterating over each number, converting it to a string, and then iterating over each digit in the string. The sum of the digits is added to the corresponding index in the `pd` array.

3. The program also calculates the cumulative sum of the `pd` array, which allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of digits for any range of numbers.

4. After precomputing the `pd` array, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the input number `n` and prints the sum of digits for the range from 1 to `n` by accessing the `pd` array.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the size of the `pd` array (2 * 10^5) and t is the number of test cases. This is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The space complexity of the program is O(N), which is also reasonable given the constraints of the problem.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
