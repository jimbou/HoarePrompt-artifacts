Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_3()'. The length of the list is determined by the input 'rows_number', which must be a positive integer. The function returns this list, with its contents dependent on the output of 'func_3()'.

def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin) and returns it as a bytes object, excluding the trailing newline character or the end of the file.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads the next line of input from the standard input (stdin) as a binary file, decodes it using the default encoding, removes any trailing newlines, and returns the resulting string.

Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of two space-separated integers from standard input, splits the string into two integers, and returns them as a list.

    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum value obtained by recursively calling `func_12` for each element in the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d`, while also updating the `rank` list with this minimum value plus one. If the list associated with key `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. The function modifies the `processing` list temporarily during its execution but reverts it to its original state before returning.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  Functionality: This function performs the extended Euclidean algorithm, taking two integers a and b as input, where b is non-zero. It returns a tuple containing the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b, and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is zero, it returns (1, 0, a).
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:

        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a string of space-separated integers based on the input integers n and k. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and appends the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1 to the list. The function then returns a string of these space-separated integers.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function generates a series of non-negative integers, each on a new line, and outputs them to the standard output. The number of lines in the output is determined by the value returned by func_10(). The function does not return any value but instead prints the output directly to the console.
