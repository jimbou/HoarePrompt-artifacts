Output State: **The program returns a string of space-separated integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), followed by the values k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1, where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, and ans is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1).**

Note: The values of n, k, b, l, bk, and lk remain unchanged.
