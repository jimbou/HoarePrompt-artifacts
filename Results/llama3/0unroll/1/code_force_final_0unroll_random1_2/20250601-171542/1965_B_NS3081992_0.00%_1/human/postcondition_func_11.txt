This function calculates and returns the minimum value obtained by recursively calling `func_12` for each element in the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d`, while also updating the `rank` list with this minimum value plus one. If the list associated with key `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. The function modifies the `processing` list temporarily during its execution but reverts it to its original state before returning.
