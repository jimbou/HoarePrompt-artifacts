Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The tree dictionary is populated with adjacency lists for each node in the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'. The tree dictionary, leaves list, dist1, and dist2 variables remain unchanged. The value of either dist1 or dist2 (or both) is still an odd number.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'. The tree dictionary, leaves list, dist1, and dist2 variables remain unchanged. The dist1 and dist2 variables still store even numbers representing the shortest distances from the start node to the first and second leaf nodes, respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the shortest distances from a start node to the leaf nodes in a graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges, and a start node, and returns either 'Ron' if the distance to at least one leaf node is odd, or 'Hermione' if both distances are even. The function does not modify the input graph or any other external state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when the queue is empty, and the output state will be the distance from the start node to the target node in the tree. If the target node is not reachable from the start node, the loop will not terminate and the output state will be undefined.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node in the tree.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance from a start node to a target node in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.
