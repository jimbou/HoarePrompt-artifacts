Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start.**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged, with start and target still being integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree still being a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The code introduces two new variables: queue and visited. The queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, indicating that the node start is being processed at a distance of 0 from the starting point. The visited set contains the node start, indicating that it has been visited during the processing.
