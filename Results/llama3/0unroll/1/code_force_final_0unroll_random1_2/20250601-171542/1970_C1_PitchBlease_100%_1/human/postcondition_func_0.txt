This function determines the winner of a game based on the shortest distances from a start node to the leaf nodes in a graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges, and a start node, and returns either 'Ron' if the distance to at least one leaf node is odd, or 'Hermione' if both distances are even. The function does not modify the input graph or any other external state.
