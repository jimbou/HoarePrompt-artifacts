#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The tree dictionary is populated with adjacency lists for each node in the graph, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'. The tree dictionary, leaves list, dist1, and dist2 variables remain unchanged. The value of either dist1 or dist2 (or both) is still an odd number.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'. The tree dictionary, leaves list, dist1, and dist2 variables remain unchanged. The dist1 and dist2 variables still store even numbers representing the shortest distances from the start node to the first and second leaf nodes, respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the shortest distances from a start node to the leaf nodes in a graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges, and a start node, and returns either 'Ron' if the distance to at least one leaf node is odd, or 'Hermione' if both distances are even. The function does not modify the input graph or any other external state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.

    visited = set([start])

        current, dist = queue.popleft()

            return dist

            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when the queue is empty, and the output state will be the distance from the start node to the target node in the tree. If the target node is not reachable from the start node, the loop will not terminate and the output state will be undefined.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node in the tree.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance from a start node to a target node in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.
