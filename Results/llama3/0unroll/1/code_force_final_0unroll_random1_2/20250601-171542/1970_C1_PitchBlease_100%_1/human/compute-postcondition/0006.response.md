Postcondition: **The tree dictionary remains unchanged, populated with adjacency lists for each node in the graph. The leaves list contains all nodes with only one neighboring node. The dist1 variable stores the shortest distance from the start node to the first leaf node, and the dist2 variable stores the shortest distance from the start node to the second leaf node. Both dist1 and dist2 are even numbers.**
