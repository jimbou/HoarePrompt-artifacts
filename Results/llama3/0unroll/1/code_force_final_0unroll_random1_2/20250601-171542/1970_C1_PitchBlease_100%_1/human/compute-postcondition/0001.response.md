Output State: **The loop will terminate when the queue is empty, and the output state will be the distance from the start node to the target node in the tree. If the target node is not reachable from the start node, the loop will not terminate and the output state will be undefined.**

In natural language, the output state represents the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree, or undefined if the target node is not reachable from the start node.
