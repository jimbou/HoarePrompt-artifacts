Functionality: **This function calculates the shortest distance from a start node to a target node in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.**
