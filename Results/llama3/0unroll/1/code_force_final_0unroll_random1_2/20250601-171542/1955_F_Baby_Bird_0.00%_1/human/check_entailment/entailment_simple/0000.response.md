Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
*   The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering two cases:
    *   If the sum of the first three elements of `p` is odd (i.e., `sum(p[:3]) % 2 == 1`), it means that there is an odd number of odd numbers in the sequence. In this case, Bob can win once.
    *   The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the total number of pairs of numbers in the sequence. Since each pair can be removed by Eve to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, Bob can win at most half the time. This is calculated as `sum(p) // 2`.
*   The program prints the sum of these two values for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
