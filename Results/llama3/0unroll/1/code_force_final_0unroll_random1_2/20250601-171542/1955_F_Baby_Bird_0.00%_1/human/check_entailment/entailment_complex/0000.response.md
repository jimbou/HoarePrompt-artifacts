Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The key insight is that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.

2. The program correctly calculates the number of times Bob can win by checking two conditions:
   - If the sum of the first three elements of each line is odd, it means that the XOR of these three numbers is non-zero. In this case, Bob can win once by removing one of these numbers.
   - The program then calculates half the sum of all four integers in the line. This is because each pair of numbers with the same value can be removed to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the first three elements is odd by adding 1 to the result.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the sum of all four integers is even by dividing the sum by 2 and adding it to the result.

5. The program repeats this process for the specified number of lines, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
