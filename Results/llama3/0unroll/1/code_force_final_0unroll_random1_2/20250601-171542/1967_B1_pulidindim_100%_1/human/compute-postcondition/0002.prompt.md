You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, each time reading two positive integers n and m from stdin, and printing the calculated value of ans to stdout. The value of t will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and will be 0 after the loop finishes. The value of n and m will be updated in each iteration with the new values read from stdin. The value of count will be reset to 2 in each iteration, and will be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it exceeds m. The value of ans will be updated in each iteration of the while loop based on the values of n, count, and g. The value of g will be calculated in each iteration of the while loop based on the values of n and count. The value of countmins will be calculated in each iteration of the while loop based on the value of count.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
