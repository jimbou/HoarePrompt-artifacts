The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), with the first integer of the first test case removed from stdin**
