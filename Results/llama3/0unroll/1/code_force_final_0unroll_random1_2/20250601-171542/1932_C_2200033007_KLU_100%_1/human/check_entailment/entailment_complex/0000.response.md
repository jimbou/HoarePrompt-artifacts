Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` from the user.
2. The program correctly initializes the variables `b`, `l`, and `r` before the loop.
3. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it correctly checks the character at index `i` in the string `s`. If the character is 'L', it appends the element at index `l` in the list `a` to the list `b` and increments `l`. If the character is 'R', it appends the element at index `r` in the list `a` to the list `b` and decrements `r`. This correctly rearranges the elements of `a` based on the characters in `s`.
4. After the loop, the program correctly initializes the variables `ans` and `p`.
5. The second loop iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order, and in each iteration, it correctly calculates the cumulative product of the elements modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans`.
6. Finally, the program correctly returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the product of all elements in `b` from index `n-1` to `i` (inclusive) modulo `m`, for each element at index `i` in the original list `ans`.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
