This function takes a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' containing 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer 'm' as input. It rearranges the elements of 'a' based on the characters in 's', then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo 'm' in reverse order, and returns the resulting list of products in reverse order.
