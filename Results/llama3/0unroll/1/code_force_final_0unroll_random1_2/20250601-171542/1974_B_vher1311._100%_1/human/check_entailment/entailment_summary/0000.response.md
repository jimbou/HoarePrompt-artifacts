Reasoning: 
The provided program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by removing duplicate characters from the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order. Then, it creates a mapping between each character in `r` and its corresponding symmetric character. Finally, it replaces each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping, effectively decoding the string.

The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the number of test cases and the length of each encoded string, and printing the decoded strings.

Correctness: **True**
