Output State: **The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed string r, according to the mapping dictionary.**

In this output state, each character in the original encoded string is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed string r, as defined in the mapping dictionary. The mapping dictionary ensures that the first character in r maps to the last character in r, the second character in r maps to the second last character in r, and so on. This means that the resulting string is a rearrangement of the original encoded string, where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed string r.
