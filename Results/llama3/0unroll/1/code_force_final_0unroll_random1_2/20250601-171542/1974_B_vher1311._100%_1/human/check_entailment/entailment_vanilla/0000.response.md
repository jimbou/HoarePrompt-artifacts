Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to write a program that performs decoding, which means restoring the original string `s` from the encoding result `b`.

2. The given Python program reads the input from `sys.stdin`, which is correct.

3. It then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the string `b` and the string `b` itself.

4. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the string `b` as an argument.

5. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b` in alphabetical order.

6. It then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character.

7. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

8. The decoded string is then appended to the `results` list.

9. After all test cases have been processed, the program prints the decoded strings, one per line.

Based on the above steps, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
