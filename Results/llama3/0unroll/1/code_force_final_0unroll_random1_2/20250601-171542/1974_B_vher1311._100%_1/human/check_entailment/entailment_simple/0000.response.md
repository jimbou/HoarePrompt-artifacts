Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm constructs an auxiliary string `r` consisting of distinct letters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replaces each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

The decoding function `func_1` works by first constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`. It then creates a mapping dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the reversed string `r`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a dictionary to create the mapping between characters in `r` and their symmetric characters is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
