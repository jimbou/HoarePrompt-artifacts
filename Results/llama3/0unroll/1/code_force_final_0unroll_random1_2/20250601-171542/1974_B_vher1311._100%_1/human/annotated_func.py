#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed string r, according to the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters, removes duplicate characters, reverses their order, and replaces each character in the original string with its corresponding character from the reversed string, returning the resulting string.
