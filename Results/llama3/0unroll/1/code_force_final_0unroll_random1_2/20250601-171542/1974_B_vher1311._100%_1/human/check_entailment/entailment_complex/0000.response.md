Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by removing duplicate characters from the input string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed string `r`.

3. The program uses this mapping dictionary to replace each character in the input string `b` with its corresponding character from the reversed string `r`, effectively decoding the input string.

4. The program returns the decoded string, which is the original string `s` from which the encoding result `b` was obtained.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
