Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters sorted in ascending order, mapping is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a character from r and its corresponding character from the reversed r, such that the first character in r maps to the last character in r, the second character in r maps to the second last character in r, and so on.**

In this output state, the value of `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `r` is assigned a string of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted in ascending order. The `mapping` dictionary is created by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to its corresponding character from the reversed `r`. This means that the first character in `r` is mapped to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` is mapped to the second last character in `r`, and so on.
