Output State: **one is False, tmp is the last node in the path from z to a leaf node, lst is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its children with the path from z to a leaf node removed, rev is unchanged, x is unchanged, y is unchanged, z is unchanged, stdin is unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable "one" is set to False, the variable "tmp" now holds the last node in the path from the initial value of "z" to a leaf node (a node with no children) in the graph represented by the dictionary "lst". The dictionary "lst" has been modified such that the path from the initial value of "z" to a leaf node has been removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
