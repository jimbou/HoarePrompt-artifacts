Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its children, rev is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its parents, z is an integer, tmp is equal to z, one is True, stdin is empty**

The code executes as follows: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `z`. Since stdin contains one integer `u_1`, `z` becomes `u_1`. The second line assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`, making `tmp` equal to `u_1`. The third line sets the value of `one` to `True`. No other variables are affected.
