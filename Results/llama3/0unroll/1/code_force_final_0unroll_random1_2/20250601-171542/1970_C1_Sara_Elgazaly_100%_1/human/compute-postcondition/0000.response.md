Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary, rev is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.**

In this output state, the values of x and y are assigned from the first two inputs in stdin. The lst and rev dictionaries are initialized as empty dictionaries. The remaining inputs in stdin are left unchanged, containing n-1 lines of two integers each, followed by a single integer u_1.
