Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The code uses a conditional expression to determine what to print. The condition is `two and one`.
2. According to the initial state, `two` is False and `one` is also False.
3. Since both `two` and `one` are False, the condition `two and one` is also False.
4. When the condition is False, the code prints the value after the `else` keyword, which is `'Ron'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
