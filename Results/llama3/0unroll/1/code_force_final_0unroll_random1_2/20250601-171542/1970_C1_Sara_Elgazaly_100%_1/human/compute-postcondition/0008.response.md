Functionality: **This function determines whether a given node in a tree is even or odd distance from a leaf node in both the forward and backward directions, and prints 'Hermione' if the node is even distance from a leaf node in both directions, and 'Ron' otherwise. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result to the console. The input tree is provided through standard input, with the first line containing the number of nodes and a dummy value, followed by the edges of the tree, and finally the node to check. The function modifies the input tree by removing the path from the given node to a leaf node in both the forward and backward directions.**
