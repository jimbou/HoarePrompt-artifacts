Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if the first n elements of a given list are all zero. func_2 modifies the input list by repeatedly applying the operation to the elements between the first and last elements, and then checks the modified list using func_1.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1.  The operation in func_2 is not correctly implemented. The operation should subtract 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtract 2 from the element at index i. However, the current implementation subtracts the value of the element at index i-1 from the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1. This is not the correct operation.

2.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the length of the input list is less than 3. In this case, the operation cannot be applied, and the program should print 'NO'. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

3.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers. The problem statement specifies that the input list contains non-negative integers, but the program does not check for this. If the input list contains negative numbers, the program may produce incorrect results.

4.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains very large numbers. The problem statement specifies that the input list contains integers up to 10^9, but the program does not check for this. If the input list contains very large numbers, the program may produce incorrect results or run out of memory.

5.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list is empty. The problem statement specifies that the input list contains at least 3 elements, but the program does not check for this. If the input list is empty, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

Correctness: **False**
