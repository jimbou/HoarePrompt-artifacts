Based on the precondition, the list has been modified such that all elements except the first and last are 0, and the first and last elements are reduced by the sum of all the elements that were originally between them. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns False.

However, the print statement simply prints the string 'NO', which is not dependent on the state of the list or the result of the function func_1(list, n).

Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO', regardless of the values in the list or the result of the function.

Output: **NO**
