Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the implementation of the operation in Function 2. The operation is applied in a way that it subtracts a multiple of the previous element from the current and next elements, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem statement.

A counterexample is the input [1, 2, 7, 2]. The program will output 'NO', but it is actually possible to make all elements zero using the described operations. One possible sequence of operations is:

* Apply the operation at i=2: [1, 2, 5, 1]
* Apply the operation at i=2: [1, 2, 3, 0]
* Apply the operation at i=2: [1, 2, 1, 0]
* Apply the operation at i=1: [0, 0, 1, 0]
* Apply the operation at i=2: [0, 0, 0, 0]

This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
