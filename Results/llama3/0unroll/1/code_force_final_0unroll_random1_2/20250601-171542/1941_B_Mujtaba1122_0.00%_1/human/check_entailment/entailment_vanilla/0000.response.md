Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, and `func_2` tries to make all elements zero by applying the given operation.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. In `func_2`, the while loop condition is incorrect. It checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`, but it should check if `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1` because the operation can only be applied if the current element is at least 2 and the adjacent elements are at least 1.

2. In `func_2`, the operation is applied incorrectly. The correct operation should be `list[i - 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1`, but the program is multiplying the values by `list[i - 1]` which is incorrect.

3. The program does not handle the case when the first or last element of the list is not zero. The operation can only be applied to the middle elements, so the program should check if the first and last elements are zero separately.

4. The program does not handle the case when the list has less than 3 elements. The operation can only be applied to lists with at least 3 elements, so the program should check the length of the list before applying the operation.

5. The program does not handle the case when the list contains negative numbers. The problem statement does not mention what to do with negative numbers, but the program should at least check for them and handle them accordingly.

6. The program does not handle the case when the list contains non-integer numbers. The problem statement does not mention what to do with non-integer numbers, but the program should at least check for them and handle them accordingly.

7. The program does not have any error handling. If the input is not a list of integers, or if the list is empty, the program will crash. The program should add error handling to handle such cases.

8. The program does not have any comments or documentation. The program should have comments and documentation to explain what each function does, what the variables represent, and how the program works.

9. The program does not follow the PEP 8 style guide. The program should follow the PEP 8 style guide for naming conventions, indentation, and other style issues.

10. The program does not have any tests. The program should have tests to ensure that it works correctly for different inputs.

Correctness: **False**
