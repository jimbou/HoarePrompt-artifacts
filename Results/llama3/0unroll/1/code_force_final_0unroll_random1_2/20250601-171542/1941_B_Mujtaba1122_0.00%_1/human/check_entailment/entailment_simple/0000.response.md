Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements in the first n positions of the list are zero. func_2 applies the operation to the list until all elements except the first and last are zero, and then checks if the remaining elements can be made zero using func_1.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of func_2. The while loop condition is incorrect, as it checks if list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0, but then subtracts 1 * list[i - 1] from list[i - 1], list[i], and list[i + 1]. This is not the correct implementation of the operation.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case where the first or last element of the list is non-zero. The operation can only be applied to elements at indices 2 to n-1, so the program should handle the first and last elements separately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
