#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
    for i in range(n):

    #The program returns True, indicating that the loop has not encountered any non-zero elements in the first n elements of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if the first n elements of a given list are all zero. It returns True if all elements are zero, False if any of the first n elements are non-zero, and does not modify the original list or the value of n.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of list and n >= 3.

        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *The list is modified such that all elements except the first and last are 0, and the first and last elements are reduced by the sum of all the elements that were originally between them. If the function func_1 applied to the original list and the variable n returns True, the current value of the list is the result of this function and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the function func_1 returns False and 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by setting all elements except the first and last to 0, and reduces the first and last elements by the sum of the original elements between them. It then checks the modified list using the function func_1 and prints 'YES' if func_1 returns True, or 'NO' if func_1 returns False. The function returns the modified list if func_1 returns True, otherwise it does not return a value.
