Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. It checks if the first element of the list is 1, and if not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. If the first element is 1, it creates a sorted list of unique integers from the original list and checks if the differences between consecutive elements are greater than 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it sets a flag to False. The function then returns 'Alice' if the flag is True and 'Bob' otherwise.**
