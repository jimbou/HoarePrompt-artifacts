Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, and not_c is True.**

The code snippet first converts the list `arr` into a set, removing any duplicate elements, and assigns it to the variable `set_`. The `sort()` method is then called on `set_`, sorting the unique elements of `arr` in ascending order. The variable `not_c` is assigned the value `True`, but it does not affect the values of `arr` or `A`. The initial state of `arr` and `A` remains unchanged, with `arr` being a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, and `A` being `False`.
