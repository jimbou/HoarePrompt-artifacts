#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is `False`, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, and not_c is False.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, and not_c is False. If not_c is True, then A is set to False and not_c is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' because A is True.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. It checks if the first element of the list is 1, and if not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. If the first element is 1, it creates a sorted list of unique integers from the original list and checks if the differences between consecutive elements are greater than 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it sets a flag to False. The function then returns 'Alice' if the flag is True and 'Bob' otherwise.
