Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, and `not_c` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `A` has been updated to False because the code `A = not A` negates the original value of `A`, which was True. The other variables, `arr`, `set_`, and `not_c`, remain unchanged.
