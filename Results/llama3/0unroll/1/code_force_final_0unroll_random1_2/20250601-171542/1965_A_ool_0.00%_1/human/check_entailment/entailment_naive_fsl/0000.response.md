Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)`, where it checks if the difference between consecutive unique elements in the array is greater than 1. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual values of the elements in the array, but rather their uniqueness and order.

A counterexample is the input `[2, 2, 3, 3]`. The program will return `'Bob'`, but the correct answer is `'Alice'`. This is because Alice can choose `k=2` on her first turn, leaving Bob with no move, and thus winning the game.

The correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the array, and then check if the GCD is odd or even. If the GCD is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the GCD represents the maximum number of stones that can be removed from each pile in a single turn, and if it's odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with no move.
