Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, and the integers in the list are positive integers.**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers. The values of t, n, and the integers in the list remain the same as in the initial state.
