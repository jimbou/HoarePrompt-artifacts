Reasoning: 

The given program is almost correct. However, there is a logical error in the last line of the code. The condition for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' is incorrect. The program should print 'Alice' if dp is True and 'Bob' if dp is False. But the current code prints 'Alice' in both cases.

Correctness: **False**
