Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The logic used in the program is incorrect. The program checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array is greater than 1, and if so, it sets dp to True. However, this logic does not correctly determine the winner of the game.

A correct approach would be to find the minimum element in the array and check if it is odd or even. If it is odd, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins. This is because the minimum element determines the number of moves that can be made, and if it is odd, Alice can make the last move and win.

Here is a correct implementation:

```
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        min_val = min(arr)
        print('Alice' if min_val % 2 != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This program correctly determines the winner of the game by finding the minimum element in the array and checking if it is odd or even.
