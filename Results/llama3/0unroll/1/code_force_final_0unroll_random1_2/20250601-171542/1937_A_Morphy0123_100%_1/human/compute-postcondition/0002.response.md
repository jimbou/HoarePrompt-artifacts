Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains a single integer (n). It then processes each integer n, printing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n if n is not 1, and 1 if n is 1. The function outputs t lines, each containing a single integer, representing the results of the power of 2 calculations for each input integer n.**
