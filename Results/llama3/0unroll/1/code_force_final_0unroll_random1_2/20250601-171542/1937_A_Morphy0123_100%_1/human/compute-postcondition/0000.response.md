The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases, we can conclude that `n_cases` will be assigned a value between 1 and 10^4.

The input is consumed, so the remaining input will be the `t` lines containing a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), representing the length of the array `a`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n_cases` lines of input, each containing a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
