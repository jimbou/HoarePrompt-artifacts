Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a deque from the collections module to efficiently update the mex (minimum excluded value) as it iterates through the array in reverse order. The program also correctly handles the case where the mex is updated to be the minimum of the current mex and the difference between the mex and the current element in the array. The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
