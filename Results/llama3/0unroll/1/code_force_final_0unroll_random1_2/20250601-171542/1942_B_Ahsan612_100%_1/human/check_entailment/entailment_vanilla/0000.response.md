Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a deque from the collections module to efficiently construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

3. It initializes an array `res` of size `n` to store the permutation and a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.

4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.

5. After calculating `res[i]`, it updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.

6. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `res` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The use of a deque is not necessary in this case, as the program only accesses elements from the end of the array, and a simple list would suffice.

Correctness: **True**
