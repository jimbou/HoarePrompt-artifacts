The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the difference between the minimum excluded value (mex) and each integer in the list, updating the mex to be the minimum of the current mex and the difference. The function then prints the resulting list of differences for each test case.
