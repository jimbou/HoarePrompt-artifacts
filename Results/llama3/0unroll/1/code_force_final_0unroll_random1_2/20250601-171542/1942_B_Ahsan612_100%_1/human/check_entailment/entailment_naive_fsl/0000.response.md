Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, using the fact that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to determine the value of `p_i`.

The program uses a deque to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, which is the MEX. It iterates over the array in reverse order, and for each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding `p_i` as `mex - a_i`. It then updates the MEX to be the minimum of the current MEX and `mex - a_i`.

The program correctly handles the case where `a_i` is negative, which corresponds to the case where `p_i` is greater than the MEX. In this case, the program correctly updates the MEX to be the new minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program also correctly handles the case where `a_i` is equal to the MEX, which corresponds to the case where `p_i` is equal to 0. In this case, the program correctly sets `p_i` to 0 and does not update the MEX.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
