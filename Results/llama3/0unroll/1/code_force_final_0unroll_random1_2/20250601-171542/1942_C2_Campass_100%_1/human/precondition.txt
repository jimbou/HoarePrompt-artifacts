The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The constraints are: 1 <= t <= 10^4, 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x.
