Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly solve the problem. It first sorts the list of chosen vertices and calculates the number of available spaces between each pair of vertices. It then sorts these spaces in descending order, with even spaces first. The program then iterates over the spaces, adding as many triangles as possible to each space until it runs out of available vertices to choose.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of available vertices is less than the number of spaces, and it also correctly calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
