Output State: **The output state is the number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal, which is calculated and printed for each test case.**

In this output state, the loop iterates over each test case, calculates the number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal, and prints this value. The loop continues until all test cases have been processed, at which point the loop terminates. The output state reflects the result of the loop's execution, which is the number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal for each test case.
