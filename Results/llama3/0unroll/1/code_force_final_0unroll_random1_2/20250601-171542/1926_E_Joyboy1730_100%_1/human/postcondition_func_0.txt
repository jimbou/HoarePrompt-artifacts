This function reads input from stdin, processes t pairs of integers n and k, and prints t lines, each containing an integer calculated based on the values of n and k. For each pair, it calculates a value using the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, where `pow` is a power of 2 and `k - tot` is a non-negative integer less than the value of `a` in the inner loop. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the calculated integers to the console.
