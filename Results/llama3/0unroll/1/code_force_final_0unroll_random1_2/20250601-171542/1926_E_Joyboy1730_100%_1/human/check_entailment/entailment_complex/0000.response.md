Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program first calculates the number of cards in each group (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) by repeatedly dividing the total number of cards `n` by 2 and taking the ceiling of the result. This is done using the formula `m = (n + 1) // 2`. The remaining cards are stored in the list `L`.

2. The program then iterates over the list `L` and for each group, it checks if the `k`-th card falls within that group. If it does, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, where `pow` is the current power of 2 and `k - tot` is the position of the card within the group.

3. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the total number of cards in the previous groups by using the `tot` variable to keep track of the total number of cards processed so far.

4. The program correctly calculates the value of the `k`-th card by multiplying the power of 2 by the position of the card within the group, minus 1, and then multiplying the result by 2.

5. The program correctly prints the calculated value of the `k`-th card for each pair of integers `n` and `k` in the input.

Overall, the program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
