Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position of the card `k`.
3. It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards in each group (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.).
4. It calculates the number of cards in each group using the formula `m = (n + 1) // 2` and appends it to the list `L`. This is correct because the number of odd numbers in a range `[1, n]` is indeed `(n + 1) // 2`.
5. It initializes a variable `tot` to keep track of the total number of cards processed so far and a variable `pow` to keep track of the current power of 2.
6. It iterates over the list `L` and for each group, it checks if the current position `k` falls within the range of the current group. If it does, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
7. The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is correct because it calculates the value of the `k`-th card in the current group. The `pow` variable keeps track of the current power of 2, and the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1` calculates the value of the `k`-th odd number in the current group.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
