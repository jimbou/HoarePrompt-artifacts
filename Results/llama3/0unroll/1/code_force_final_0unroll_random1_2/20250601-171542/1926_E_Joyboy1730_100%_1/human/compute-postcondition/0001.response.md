Output State: **The loop will print t lines, each containing an integer. The integer on each line will be the value of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` for the corresponding pair of integers n and k from the input. The value of `pow` will be a power of 2, and the value of `k - tot` will be a non-negative integer less than the value of `a` in the inner loop.**
