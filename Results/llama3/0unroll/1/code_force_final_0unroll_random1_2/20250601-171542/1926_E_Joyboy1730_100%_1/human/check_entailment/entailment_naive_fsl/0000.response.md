Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. It first calculates the number of cards in each group (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) and stores them in the list L. Then, it iterates over the list L and checks if the k-th card is in the current group. If it is, it calculates the value of the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly calculates the number of cards in each group, and it correctly identifies the k-th card in each group. The formula used to calculate the value of the k-th card is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the cases where k is less than or equal to the number of cards in the first group, and it correctly handles the cases where k is greater than the number of cards in the first group but less than or equal to the total number of cards.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and it works as expected for all potential cases.
