Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether it is possible to iteratively reduce a list of positive integers `a` to zero, based on a list of non-zero integers `x` and a positive integer `k`. It returns `True` if the reduction is possible and `False` otherwise. The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` with the correct arguments, and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first sorts the monsters by their distance from the character, then iteratively tries to kill them with the available bullets. If it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Correctness: **True**
