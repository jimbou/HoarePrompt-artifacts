Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` sorts the monsters by their distance from the character and then iterates over them, firing bullets at the closest monsters first. It keeps track of the distance and the number of bullets fired, and returns `False` as soon as it encounters a monster that is closer than the number of bullets that can be fired.

The main function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there is only one monster, or when the number of bullets is greater than the number of monsters. It also correctly handles the case when a monster is at the same distance as the number of bullets that can be fired.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
