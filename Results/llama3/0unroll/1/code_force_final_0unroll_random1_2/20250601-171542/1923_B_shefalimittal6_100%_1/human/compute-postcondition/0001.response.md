Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, and in each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `x` from the input. It will then print 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will be updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain the same.
