Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n is even and k is odd, the program will return an incorrect result. This is because the program assumes that k is always even, and it divides k by 2 without checking if it is odd. When k is odd, this division will result in a fractional value, which will cause the program to produce an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where n is 1 and k is greater than 0. In this case, the program will return an incorrect result because it does not check if n is 1 before performing the calculations.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
