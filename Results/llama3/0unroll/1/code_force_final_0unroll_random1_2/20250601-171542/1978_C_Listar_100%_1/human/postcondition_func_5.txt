This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without modifying the state of the program. If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1(n, k)` and `func_5(l)`, and returns the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.
