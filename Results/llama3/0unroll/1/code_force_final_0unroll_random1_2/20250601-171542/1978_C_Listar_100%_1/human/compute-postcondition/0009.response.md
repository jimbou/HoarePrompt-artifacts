Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are non-negative integers, stdin contains no input, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, the current value of `max_k` is an integer equal to `(n + k) / 2`, otherwise, the current value of `max_k` is equal to `n` squared divided by 2. Additionally, the current value of `max_k` is less than `k`.***
