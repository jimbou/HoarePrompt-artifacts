You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The number of test cases is a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) which is given in the first line of the input.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: The output state will contain the same number of test cases as the initial state. Each test case will contain a list of n integers, where n is the same as in the initial state. The first integer in each list will be 1000, and each subsequent integer will be the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding integer from the initial state. For example, if the initial state contains a test case with n=3 and x=[2, 3], the output state will contain a test case with the list [1000, 1002, 1005].

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
