Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n and a list of n-1 integers. It then generates a new list of n integers, where the first integer is 1000, and each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding integer from the input list. The function prints each generated list as output, with the same number of test cases as the input.**
