Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The number of test cases is a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) which is given in the first line of the input.**
