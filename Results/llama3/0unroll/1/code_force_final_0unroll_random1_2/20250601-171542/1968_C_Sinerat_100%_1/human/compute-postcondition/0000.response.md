Output State: **The output state will contain the same number of test cases as the initial state. Each test case will contain a list of n integers, where n is the same as in the initial state. The first integer in each list will be 1000, and each subsequent integer will be the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding integer from the initial state. For example, if the initial state contains a test case with n=3 and x=[2, 3], the output state will contain a test case with the list [1000, 1002, 1005].**
