This function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of cities, their coordinates, a number of queries, and query pairs of city indices. It calculates the total distance between each pair of cities in the queries, considering the differences between city coordinates and the number of cities in between. The function then prints the total distance for each query.
