Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the query pairs of city indices.

2. The program correctly calculates the total distance between each pair of cities in the queries. It uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative distances from the first city to each subsequent city and from the last city to each preceding city, respectively.

3. The program correctly handles the two cases for calculating the distance between two cities: when the destination city is to the right of the source city, and when it is to the left. In the first case, it uses the `d1` dictionary to calculate the distance, and in the second case, it uses the `d2` dictionary.

4. The program correctly prints the total distance for each query.

5. The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, including the uniqueness of city coordinates, the uniqueness of queries, and the bounds on the number of cities and queries.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
