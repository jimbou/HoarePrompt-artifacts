stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), then an integer m (1 <= m <= 10^5), and then m lines each containing two integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).
