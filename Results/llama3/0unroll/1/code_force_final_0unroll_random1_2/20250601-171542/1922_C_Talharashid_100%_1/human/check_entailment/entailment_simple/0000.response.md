Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities in each query.

Here's why:

1. The program first initializes two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city and from each city to the last city, respectively.

2. It then iterates over the list of cities, calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city and storing it in `d1`. It does this by comparing the distance between the current city and the next city with the distance between the current city and the previous city. If the distance to the next city is less, it adds 1 to the total coins; otherwise, it adds the distance to the next city.

3. It does the same thing in reverse to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from each city to the last city and stores it in `d2`.

4. Finally, it iterates over the queries, calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between each pair of cities by subtracting the coins needed to travel from the first city to the starting city from the coins needed to travel from the first city to the ending city (if the ending city is after the starting city) or by subtracting the coins needed to travel from the last city to the ending city from the coins needed to travel from the last city to the starting city (if the ending city is before the starting city).

This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, while traveling to any other city costs the distance between the two cities.

Correctness: **True**
