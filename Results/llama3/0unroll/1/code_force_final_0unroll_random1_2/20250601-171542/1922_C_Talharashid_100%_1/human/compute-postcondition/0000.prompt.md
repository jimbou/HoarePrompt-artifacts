Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and finally a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers represents the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers represents the queries. The number of cities and the number of queries are positive integers. The coordinates of the cities are non-negative integers. The queries are unique pairs of city indices (1-indexed).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
