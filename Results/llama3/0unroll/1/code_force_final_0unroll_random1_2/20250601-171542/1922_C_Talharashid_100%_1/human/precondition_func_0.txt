stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and finally a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers represents the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers represents the queries. The number of cities and the number of queries are positive integers. The coordinates of the cities are non-negative integers. The queries are unique pairs of city indices (1-indexed).
