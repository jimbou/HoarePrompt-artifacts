Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative distances from the first city to each subsequent city and from the last city to each preceding city, respectively. The program then uses these dictionaries to calculate the minimum distance between each pair of cities in the queries.

The program correctly handles the cases where the closest city to a given city is either the previous city or the next city, and it correctly calculates the minimum distance by adding the distances between the cities in between.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the query pair consists of the first and last cities, or when the query pair consists of two adjacent cities.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
