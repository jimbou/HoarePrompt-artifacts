The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^5) first, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= n <= 26), `k` (1 <= k <= 26), and `m` (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Since the first integer `t` is accepted and assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= n <= 26), `k` (1 <= k <= 26), and `m` (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= n <= 26), `k` (1 <= k <= 26), and `m` (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
