Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s. It checks if the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets at least n times. If it does, the function outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' followed by a constructed string of length n, where each of the first k alphabets appears at least once, and the remaining characters are filled with 'a's.**
