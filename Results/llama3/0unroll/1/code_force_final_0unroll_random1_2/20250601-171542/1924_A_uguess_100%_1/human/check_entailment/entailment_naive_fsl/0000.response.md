Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string `s` contains characters that are not among the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In such cases, the program will incorrectly increment the `cur` variable and potentially set bits that are not supposed to be set.

For example, if `n=2`, `k=2`, and `s="abc"`, the program will incorrectly set the bit corresponding to the character 'c' (which is not among the first 2 lowercase English alphabets) and will print "YES" instead of "NO".

To fix this issue, the program should ignore characters in `s` that are not among the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
