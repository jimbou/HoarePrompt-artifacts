Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the hour is 12. According to the problem description, 12 should be printed as 12, not 00. However, the program prints 00 for 12. 

For example, when the input is "12:14", the program will print "00:14 PM" instead of "12:14 PM".
