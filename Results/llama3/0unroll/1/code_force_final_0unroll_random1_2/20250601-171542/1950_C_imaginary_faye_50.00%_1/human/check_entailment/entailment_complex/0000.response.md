Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
3. It extracts the hour `h` from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
4. It checks the value of `h` and prints the corresponding hour in 12-hour format:
	* If `h` is '00', it prints '12' (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
	* If `h` is less than or equal to 12, it prints the original value of `h` (since the hour remains the same in 12-hour format).
	* If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, padding with a leading zero if necessary (since hours 13-23 in 24-hour format correspond to hours 1-11 in 12-hour format).
5. It prints the remaining part of the time string (`s[2:]`) which represents the minutes.
6. It prints either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of `h`. If `h` is greater than or equal to 12, it prints 'PM'; otherwise, it prints 'AM'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. The use of slicing and conditional statements makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
