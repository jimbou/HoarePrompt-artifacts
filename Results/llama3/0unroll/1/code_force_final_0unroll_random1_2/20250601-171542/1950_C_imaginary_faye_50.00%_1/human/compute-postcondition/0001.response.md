Functionality: **Converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format.**

This function takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of time conversions to perform. It then reads `t` strings, each representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). The function converts each time to 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM) and prints the converted time. If the hour is 00, it is converted to 12. If the hour is between 1 and 12, it remains the same. If the hour is between 13 and 23, it is converted to the corresponding 12-hour format (e.g., 13 becomes 1, 14 becomes 2, etc.). The function also appends AM or PM to the converted time based on the original hour.
