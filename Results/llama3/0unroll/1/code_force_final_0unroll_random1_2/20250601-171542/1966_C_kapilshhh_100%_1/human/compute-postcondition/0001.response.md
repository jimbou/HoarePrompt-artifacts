Output State: **tc is 0, and the values of the variables n, arr, and dp have been updated according to the last test case.**

In natural language, the output state means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the variable `tc` has been decremented to 0. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `dp` have been updated with the values from the last test case. The value of `n` is the length of the array `arr` minus 1, `arr` is the sorted list of unique integers from the last test case in descending order with an additional 0 at the end, and `dp` is a boolean value indicating whether the difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1 or not.
