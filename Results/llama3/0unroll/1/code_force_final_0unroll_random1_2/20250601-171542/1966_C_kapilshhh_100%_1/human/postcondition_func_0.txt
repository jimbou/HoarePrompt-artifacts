This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of integers. It takes a list of integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and then checks if the difference between consecutive integers is greater than 1. If this condition is met, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers, and prints the winner for each case.
