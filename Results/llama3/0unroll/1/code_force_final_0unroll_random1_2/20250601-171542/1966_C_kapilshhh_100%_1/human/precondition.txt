stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, … a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The number of test cases is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) which is given in the first line of the input.
