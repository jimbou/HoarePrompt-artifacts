This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n distinct integers. The function swaps the first and k-th elements, then calculates the maximum number of elements that can be removed to make the remaining elements non-decreasing. It also considers an alternative scenario where the k-th element is moved to a different position. The function prints the maximum number of removable elements for each test case.
