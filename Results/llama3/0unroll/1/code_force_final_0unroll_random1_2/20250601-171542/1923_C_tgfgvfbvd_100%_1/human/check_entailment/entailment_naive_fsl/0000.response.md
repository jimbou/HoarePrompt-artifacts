Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". It maintains two prefix arrays, `p` and `c`, where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements in the array and `c[i]` is the count of 1's in the first `i` elements. 

For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray (`s`) and the count of 1's in the subarray (`i`). It then checks if the subarray is good by verifying that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "extra" value in the subarray to distribute among the elements to make them all greater than 1, while also ensuring that the sum of the subarray remains the same.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including subarrays of length 1, subarrays with no 1's, and subarrays with all 1's. It also handles the case where the subarray is the entire array.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
