Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three parts: 
1. A line with two space-separated integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5).
2. A line with n space-separated integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 10^9).
3. q lines each with two space-separated integers l_i and r_i (1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n).**
