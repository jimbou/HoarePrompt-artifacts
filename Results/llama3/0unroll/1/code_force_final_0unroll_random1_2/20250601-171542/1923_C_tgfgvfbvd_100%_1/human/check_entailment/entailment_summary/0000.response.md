Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the prefix sum `p` and the count of 1s `c` for the given array `l`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray and the count of 1s in any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, it calculates the sum `s` of the subarray and the count `i` of 1s in the subarray.

3. It then checks if the subarray is "good" by checking if the sum of the subarray minus its length is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. This is because we need to distribute the sum of the subarray among its elements such that each element is greater than 1 and different from the original element. If the sum minus the length is greater than or equal to the count of 1s, it means we have enough "extra" value to distribute among the 1s to make them greater than 1.

4. It also checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1, because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" according to the problem definition.

5. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
