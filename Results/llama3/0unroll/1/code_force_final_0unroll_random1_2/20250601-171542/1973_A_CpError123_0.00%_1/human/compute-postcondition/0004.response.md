Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of lists `cas_de_test`, where each sublist contains three non-negative integers in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of possible equalities in a series of matches, where the total points are distributed among three teams. If the total points are odd or the number of matches is invalid, it returns -1 for that case. Otherwise, it calculates the number of equalities based on the points distribution and returns the result as a list of integers. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of possible equalities for each case in the input list, or -1 if the case is invalid.**
