Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes as input a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first checks if the total number of points is odd. If it is, the program immediately returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario (since each game can only result in an even number of points being awarded).

2. The program then calculates the total number of matches played by dividing the total number of points by 2. If the total number of matches is greater than 3, or if the highest score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario (since each match can only result in a maximum of 2 points being awarded to one player).

3. If the total number of points is valid, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. This is done by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score (p3) and the middle score (p2), and twice the difference between the highest score (p3) and the lowest score (p1), from the total number of points. This effectively removes the points that must have been awarded due to wins, leaving only the points that could have been awarded due to draws.

4. If the calculated number of draws is negative, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Otherwise, the program returns the calculated number of draws divided by 2, since each draw results in 2 points being awarded.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles invalid scenarios and calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a valid scenario.

Correctness: **True**
