Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three non-negative integers each, sorted in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `resultats` and assigned it an empty list.
