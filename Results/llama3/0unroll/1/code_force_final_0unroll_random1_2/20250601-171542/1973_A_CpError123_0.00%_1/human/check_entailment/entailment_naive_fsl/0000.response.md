Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three players. The program checks for the following conditions:

1.  The total number of points is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.
2.  The total number of matches is not more than 3, and the maximum score of any player is not more than the total number of matches.
3.  The number of draws is calculated based on the scores of the players, and if the calculated number of draws is negative, the program returns -1, indicating that the scores are not valid.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including the case where no games were played (all scores are 0), and the case where the scores are not valid (returns -1).

The program also correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for the given test cases, and the output matches the expected output.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
