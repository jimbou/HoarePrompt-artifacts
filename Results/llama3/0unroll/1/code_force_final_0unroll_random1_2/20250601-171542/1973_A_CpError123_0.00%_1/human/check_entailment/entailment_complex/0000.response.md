Reasoning:

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess matches between three players. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The function first checks if the total points `total_points` is odd. If it is, the function returns -1, as the total points must be even (since each match can result in either a win, loss, or draw, which contributes 2, 0, or 1 points, respectively).
2. The function then calculates the total number of matches `total_matchs` by dividing the total points by 2. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`, the function returns -1, as this would imply an invalid number of matches or an impossible score distribution.
3. The function then calculates the number of equalities `egalites` by subtracting twice the difference between `p3` and `p2` and twice the difference between `p3` and `p1` from the total points. This is based on the fact that each equality contributes 1 point to the total points, and the differences between the scores represent the number of wins and losses.
4. If `egalites` is negative, the function returns -1, as this would imply an invalid score distribution. Otherwise, the function returns `egalites` divided by 2, which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, including invalid inputs, and returns the expected output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
