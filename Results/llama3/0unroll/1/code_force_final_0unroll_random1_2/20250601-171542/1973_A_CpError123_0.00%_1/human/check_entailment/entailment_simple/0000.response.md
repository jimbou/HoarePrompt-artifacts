Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the total points, and checks if the total points are even. If not, it appends -1 to the result list, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

If the total points are even, the program calculates the total number of matches and checks if it exceeds 3 or if the highest score exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the result list.

Otherwise, the program calculates the number of draws by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score and the second-highest score, and twice the difference between the highest score and the lowest score, from the total points. If the result is negative, it appends -1 to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the result divided by 2 to the result list.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
