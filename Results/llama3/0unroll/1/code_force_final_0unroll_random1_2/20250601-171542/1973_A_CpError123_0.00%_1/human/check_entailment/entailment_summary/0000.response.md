Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the total points earned by each player and the constraints that the total points must be even and the number of matches must be valid.

The program correctly handles the cases where the total points are odd or the number of matches is invalid by returning -1 for those cases. It also correctly calculates the number of equalities based on the points distribution.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. In the line where it calculates the number of equalities, it uses the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the points earned by the players are always in the order p1 <= p2 <= p3. However, the problem statement does not guarantee this order.

To fix this mistake, the program should sort the points earned by the players in non-decreasing order before calculating the number of equalities. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        p1, p2, p3 = sorted([p1, p2, p3])  # Sort the points in non-decreasing order
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

Correctness: **False**
