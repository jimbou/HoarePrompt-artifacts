Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a polygon with a specified number of sides and vertices chosen by Bessie, along with a maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. It calculates and prints the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen for each test case, considering the arrangement of Bessie's chosen vertices and the available gaps between them. The function iterates through each test case, processing the input data, and outputs the maximum number of choosable vertices for each case.**
