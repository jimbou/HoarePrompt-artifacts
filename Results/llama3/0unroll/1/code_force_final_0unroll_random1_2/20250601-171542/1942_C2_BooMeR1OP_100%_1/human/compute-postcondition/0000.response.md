Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
