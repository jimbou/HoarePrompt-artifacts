Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen for each test case, printed on separate lines. The value of `t` is not explicitly changed in the loop, but its value is used to control the number of iterations. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `st`, `odd`, and `even` are updated in each iteration, but their final values are not retained after the loop finishes. The output state only includes the printed values of `ans` for each test case.**
