Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum excluded value for each positive integer in the input list. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads two inputs from stdin: an integer representing the length of a list, and a list of integers. It then calculates the minimum excluded value for each positive integer in the list and prints these values. The function also keeps track of used values in a dictionary, but this is not output. The function does not modify the input list or its length.**
