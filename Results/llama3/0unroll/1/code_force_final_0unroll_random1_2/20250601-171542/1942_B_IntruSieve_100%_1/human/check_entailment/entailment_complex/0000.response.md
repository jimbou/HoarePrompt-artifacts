Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values and a list `mex` to store the minimum excluded values. The program iterates through the input list `arr` and for each element, it checks if the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum excluded value `minn` to the `mex` list and updates `minn` to the next available minimum excluded value. If the element is negative, it appends the absolute value of the difference between the current minimum excluded value `minn` and the element to the `mex` list. Finally, the program prints the `mex` list, which represents the valid permutation p.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the `used` dictionary ensures that each value in the permutation p is unique, and the `mex` list is updated correctly based on the input elements.

Correctness: **True**
