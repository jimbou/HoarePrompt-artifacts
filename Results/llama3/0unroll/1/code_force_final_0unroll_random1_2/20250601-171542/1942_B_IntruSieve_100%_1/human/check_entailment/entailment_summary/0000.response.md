Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of used values and calculates the minimum excluded value (MEX) for each positive integer in the array. The program then prints the calculated MEX values, which represent the permutation p.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the cases where a_i is positive or negative. When a_i is positive, the program appends the current minimum excluded value (minn) to the mex list and updates the used dictionary. When a_i is negative, the program appends the absolute difference between the current minimum excluded value and a_i to the mex list and updates the used dictionary.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples, and it should produce correct results for other valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
