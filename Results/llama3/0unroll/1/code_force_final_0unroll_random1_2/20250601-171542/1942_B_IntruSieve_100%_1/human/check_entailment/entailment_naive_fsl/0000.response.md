Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The issue lies in the way the program handles the case when a_i is negative.

According to the problem description, a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i, where MEX is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. When a_i is negative, it means that p_i is equal to the absolute value of a_i minus the current minimum non-negative integer (minn). However, the program does not correctly update the minimum non-negative integer (minn) after assigning p_i.

For example, consider the input:

3
-2 1 2

The program will output:

2 0 1

However, this is not a correct permutation. The correct permutation should be:

2 0 1

The issue arises because the program does not correctly update the minimum non-negative integer (minn) after assigning p_i. As a result, the program produces an incorrect permutation.

To fix this issue, the program needs to correctly update the minimum non-negative integer (minn) after assigning p_i. One possible solution is to use a separate variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that has not been assigned yet, and update this variable accordingly after each assignment.
