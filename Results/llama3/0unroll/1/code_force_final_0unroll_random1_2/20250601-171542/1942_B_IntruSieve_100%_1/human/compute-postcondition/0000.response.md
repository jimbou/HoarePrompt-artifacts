Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer that was input from stdin. The value of `arr` is a list of integers between `-n` and `n` that was also input from stdin. The values of `mex`, `minn`, and `used` are initialized as an empty list, 0, and an empty dictionary, respectively. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
