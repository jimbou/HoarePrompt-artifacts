Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation, a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer not in the permutation, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used integers.
4. It iterates over the array `a`. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than 0. If it is, it means that the current element in the permutation should be the minimum non-negative integer not in the permutation, which is `minn`. It appends `minn` to the `mex` list and marks it as used. Then, it increments `minn` until it finds the next minimum non-negative integer not in the permutation.
5. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it means that the current element in the permutation should be the absolute difference between `minn` and `arr[i]`. It appends this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used.
6. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly. It should be defined as a function that takes no arguments, but it is called with no arguments. To fix this, the function definition should be changed to `def func_1():`.

Correctness: **True**
