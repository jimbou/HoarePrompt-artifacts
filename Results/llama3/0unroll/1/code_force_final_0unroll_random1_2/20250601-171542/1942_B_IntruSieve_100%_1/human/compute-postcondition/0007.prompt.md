You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains integers between -n and n, where n is the length of the list.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: Output State: The list mex contains the minimum excluded value for each positive integer in the input list arr, and the dictionary used keeps track of the used values. The variable minn is updated to the next available minimum excluded value after each iteration. The other variables n and arr remain unchanged.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The list mex contains the minimum excluded value for each positive integer in the input list arr, and the dictionary used keeps track of the used values. The variable minn is updated to the next available minimum excluded value after each iteration. The other variables n and arr remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: The minimum excluded value for each positive integer in the input list arr, which is the value of mex, and the used values, which is the value of used

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
