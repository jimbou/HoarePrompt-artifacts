Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values and a list `mex` to store the minimum excluded values for each positive integer in the input list `arr`. The variable `minn` is updated to the next available minimum excluded value after each iteration.

The program correctly handles both positive and negative values in the input list `arr`. For positive values, it appends the current minimum excluded value `minn` to the `mex` list and updates `minn` to the next available minimum excluded value. For negative values, it appends the absolute difference between the current minimum excluded value `minn` and the absolute value of the negative number to the `mex` list.

The program then prints the minimum excluded values for each positive integer in the input list `arr`, which is the value of `mex`.

Correctness: **True**
