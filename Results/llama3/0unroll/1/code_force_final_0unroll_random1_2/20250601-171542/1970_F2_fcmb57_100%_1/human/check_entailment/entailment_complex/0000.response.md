Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is supposed to move an entity (player or Quaffle) in a specific direction on the field. However, the function is incorrectly implemented. It is trying to concatenate integers with strings, which is not the intended behavior.

The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:

```
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

This function takes two lists, `a` and `b`, as input. List `a` contains two integers representing the current position of the entity, and list `b` contains two integers representing the direction of movement. The function returns two values: the new x-coordinate and the new y-coordinate of the entity after moving in the specified direction.

With this correction, the overall program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
