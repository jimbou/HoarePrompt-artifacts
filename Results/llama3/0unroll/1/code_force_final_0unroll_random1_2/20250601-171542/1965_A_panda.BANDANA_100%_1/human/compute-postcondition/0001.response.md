Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, each corresponding to the result of a test case. The number of outputs is equal to the initial value of t. The output for each test case depends on the sequence of integers in the input. If the sequence contains a 1 and has more than one distinct element, the output is determined by the differences between consecutive distinct elements in the sorted sequence. If any difference is greater than 1, the output is 'Bob' if the index of the larger element is odd, and 'Alice' otherwise. If all differences are 1, the output is 'Alice' if the length of the sequence is odd, and 'Bob' otherwise. If the sequence does not contain a 1 or has only one distinct element, the output is 'Alice'.**
