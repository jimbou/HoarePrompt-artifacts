The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains t test cases, the first input is the number of test cases. After reading this input, the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^5), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, … a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
