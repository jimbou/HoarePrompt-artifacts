This function determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of integers provided as input. It processes multiple test cases, each containing a sequence of integers. For each test case, it checks if the sequence contains a 1 and has more than one distinct element. If so, it analyzes the differences between consecutive distinct elements in the sorted sequence. If any difference is greater than 1, it declares 'Bob' as the winner if the index of the larger element is odd, and 'Alice' otherwise. If all differences are 1, it declares 'Alice' as the winner if the length of the sequence is odd, and 'Bob' otherwise. If the sequence does not contain a 1 or has only one distinct element, it declares 'Alice' as the winner. The function prints the winner for each test case to the console.
