Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided functions are:

1. `func_1()`: This function reads two positive integers n and m from standard input, calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and prints the result.

2. `func_2()`: This function reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m, and performs some unspecified action for each line of input.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1()` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case, and `func_2()` is designed to read multiple test cases and call `func_1()` for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems that `func_1()` is not actually solving the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b, but `func_1()` is only calculating the number of coprime pairs (a, b).

Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
