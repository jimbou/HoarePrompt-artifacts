Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is the main function that calculates the count of valid pairs for a given input of n and m. `func_2` is a wrapper function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` reads the input values of n and m using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. It initializes a variable `x` to 1 and a count variable `cnt` to 0.
3. The program uses a while loop to iterate over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`. This is done to ensure that `x` is not too large, as the problem statement guarantees that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6.
4. Inside the while loop, another while loop is used to iterate over possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This is done to ensure that the pair (a, b) = (x * (x + y), y * (x + y)) satisfies the conditions.
5. If `math.gcd(x, y)` is equal to 1, it means that `x` and `y` are coprime. In this case, the program increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is done to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.
6. After the inner while loop, the program increments `x` by 1 and continues with the outer while loop.
7. Once the outer while loop finishes, the program prints the count `cnt`.
8. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program appears to be correct, as it correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. The use of while loops and the calculation of the count `cnt` seem to be accurate.

Correctness: **True**
