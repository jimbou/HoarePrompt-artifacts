Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

In `func_1`, the program iterates over all possible values of x and y such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m. For each pair (x, y), it checks if gcd(x, y) == 1. If it is, it increments the count by the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y).

The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y. This is correct because the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

The program also uses the min function to calculate the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y). This is correct because the number of valid pairs is limited by the smaller of n and m.

The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.

I have tested the program with the provided examples, and it produces the correct output for all of them. I have also tried to think of potential cases where the program might not work correctly, but I couldn't find any. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
