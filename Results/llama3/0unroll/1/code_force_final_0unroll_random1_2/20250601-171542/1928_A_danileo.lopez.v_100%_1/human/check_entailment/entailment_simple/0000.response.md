Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The program works by checking if either a or b is even. If either a or b is even, it checks if the resulting rectangle after cutting can be formed into a different rectangle. If a is even, it checks if a/2 is not equal to b. If b is even, it checks if b/2 is not equal to a. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'. If neither condition is true, it prints 'No'.

If both a and b are odd, it prints 'No' because it is not possible to form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
