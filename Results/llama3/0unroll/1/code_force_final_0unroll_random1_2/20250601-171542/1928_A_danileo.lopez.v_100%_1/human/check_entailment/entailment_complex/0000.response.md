Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if Bob can obtain some other rectangle from the a x b rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The program works by checking if either a or b is even. If either a or b is even, it checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If they are not equal, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. If they are equal, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

If both a and b are odd, the program prints 'No', because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
