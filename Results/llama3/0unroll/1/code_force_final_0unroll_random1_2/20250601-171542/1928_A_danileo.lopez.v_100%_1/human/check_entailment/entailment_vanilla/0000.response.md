Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

3. The program then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either of them is even, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves.

4. If `a` is even, it calculates the dimensions of the two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`) and checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`. If this condition is true, it means that the two halves can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so it prints 'Yes'.

5. If `b` is even, it performs a similar check as in step 4 but for `b`.

6. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the conditions in steps 4 and 5 are not met, it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the cases where the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves and rearranged to form a different rectangle. It also correctly handles the cases where this is not possible.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. In the case where `a` is even and `a1` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'No' without checking if `b` is also even. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is `4 4`, the program will print 'No' because `a1` is equal to `b`, but it should actually print 'Yes' because `b` is also even and the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves.

To fix this mistake, the program should check if `b` is also even in the case where `a` is even and `a1` is equal to `b`.

Correctness: **False**
