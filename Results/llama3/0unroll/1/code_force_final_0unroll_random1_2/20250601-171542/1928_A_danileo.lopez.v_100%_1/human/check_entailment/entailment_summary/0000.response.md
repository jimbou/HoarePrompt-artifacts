Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming another rectangle from these two rectangles. The program takes two integers a and b as input, representing the size of the rectangle.

The program first checks if either a or b is even. If either of them is even, it calculates the half of the even number and checks if it is not equal to the other number. If it is not equal, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. If both a and b are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct because if either a or b is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by cutting along the even side. Then, he can form another rectangle from these two rectangles by rotating and moving them. If both a and b are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides, so he cannot obtain another rectangle.

The execution summary is also correct, as it accurately describes the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
