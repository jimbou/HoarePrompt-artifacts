The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
