Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The logic is as follows:

- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal parts. If the resulting parts are not equal to the other dimension, Bob can form another rectangle. For example, if `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two parts of size `a/2` x `b`. If `a/2` is not equal to `b`, Bob can form another rectangle of size `a/2` x `2b`.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because the resulting parts will always be equal to the other dimension.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
