Output State: **The output will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair of input integers (a, b), indicating whether a can be transformed into b or vice versa by repeatedly dividing by 2, with the condition that at least one of a or b is even. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the value of t. The value of t and the input lines will remain unchanged.**
