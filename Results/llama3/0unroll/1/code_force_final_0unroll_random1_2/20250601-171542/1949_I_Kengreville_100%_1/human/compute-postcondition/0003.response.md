Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False**

The code initializes three new variables: `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`. The first line sets `tot` to 0. The second line sets `bipartite` to True. The third line sets `ok` to False. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
