Reasoning:

The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) .

The given program defines several functions, but only Function 15 (func_15) is relevant to the problem. This function calculates the number of valid pairs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The function takes two integers n and m as input, which are the upper bounds for a and b, respectively.

2. It initializes a variable i to 1 and a variable ans to 0. The variable ans will store the count of valid pairs.

3. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as i * i is less than or equal to n + i. This loop is used to iterate over the possible values of i.

4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the value of (n + i) // (i * i) and adds it to ans. This calculation is based on the condition that a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b).

5. After the loop, the function returns the value of ans - 1. The subtraction of 1 is likely to account for the case where a = b = 1, which is not a valid pair according to the problem statement.

6. The main function (func_16) calls func_15 for each test case and prints the result.

Based on the above analysis, the given program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid pairs according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
