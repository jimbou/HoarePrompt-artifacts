Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem, which involves calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program consists of multiple functions, each with its own specific task.

The main function, func_16(), reads the number of test cases from the standard input and then calls func_15() for each test case. func_15() calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared for all i from 1 to the square root of n, then subtracts 1 from the result.

The problem description requires the program to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Upon analyzing the functions, it appears that func_15() is the core function that calculates the desired result. However, the calculation performed by func_15() does not seem to directly relate to the conditions specified in the problem description.

The calculation in func_15() involves summing up integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared, which does not seem to have any connection to the conditions a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the given Python program does not correctly solve the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**
