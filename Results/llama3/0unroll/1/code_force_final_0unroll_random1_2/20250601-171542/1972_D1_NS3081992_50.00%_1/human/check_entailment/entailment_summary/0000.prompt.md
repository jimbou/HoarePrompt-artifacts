Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

 Output hints for function2:  Reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns a map object containing these integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two space-separated values, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list of two positive integers.
Function number 4 :

    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list by repeating the result of func_3() a specified number of times, as determined by the input parameter rows_number, and returns the resulting list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a string from standard input, removes trailing newlines and whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string, containing two integers separated by a space.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function takes no parameters and returns a list of two integers that were input by the user, separated by a space.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  Generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the return value of the function 'func_7()'.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()

 Output hints for function9:  Reads and returns the entire string from the standard input (stdin), without modifying it.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without performing any modifications or actions on the input value.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()

 Output hints for function11:  The function accepts a string input containing two space-separated positive integers and returns a list of two strings, each representing a positive integer, separated by a space.
Function number 12 :

    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the processing status of its dependencies. If the key has only one dependency, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iteratively checks the processing status of each dependency, updates the minimum rank if necessary, and returns the updated rank plus 1. The function also updates the `rank` list with the calculated rank for the given key.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1

    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates and returns the result of the extended Euclidean algorithm for two integers a and b. If b is zero, it returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns a tuple containing the results of this recursive call, along with an additional calculated value based on the integer division of a by b.

    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function evaluates the list 'a' of integers and adjusts the value of 'k' based on the elements in 'a' that are less than 'm'. It then returns 1 if 'k' is greater than or equal to 0 after the adjustment, and -1 otherwise. The function does not modify the list 'a' or the values of 'n' and 'm'.
Function number 15 :

        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared for all i from 1 to the square root of n, then subtracts 1 from the result, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.
