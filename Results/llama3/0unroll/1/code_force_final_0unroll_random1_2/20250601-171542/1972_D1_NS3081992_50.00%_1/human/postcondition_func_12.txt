This function calculates and returns the result of the extended Euclidean algorithm for two integers a and b. If b is zero, it returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns a tuple containing the results of this recursive call, along with an additional calculated value based on the integer division of a by b.
