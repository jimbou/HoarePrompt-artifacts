This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the processing status of its dependencies. If the key has only one dependency, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iteratively checks the processing status of each dependency, updates the minimum rank if necessary, and returns the updated rank plus 1. The function also updates the `rank` list with the calculated rank for the given key.
