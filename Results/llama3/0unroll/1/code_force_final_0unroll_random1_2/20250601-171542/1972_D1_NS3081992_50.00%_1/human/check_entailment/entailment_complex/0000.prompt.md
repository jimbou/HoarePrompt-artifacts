Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer representing a key in d, and rank is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in d.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns an integer with a value of 1.
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer representing a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is an integer with a value of 10^9 (1,000,000,000). The length of the list of integers in `d` corresponding to the key `da` is more than 1.

    #State: The value of `tmp` is updated to the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and `processing` remains unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, plus 1, which is the updated value of `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the processing status of its dependencies. If the key has only one dependency, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iteratively checks the processing status of each dependency, updates the minimum rank if necessary, and returns the updated rank plus 1. The function also updates the `rank` list with the calculated rank for the given key.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1

    #State: *a and b are integers and b is non-zero
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y, x, and g are the return values of the function func_13(b, a % b), where b is a non-zero integer and a is an integer. The value of x - a // b * y is calculated using the integer division of a by b and the product of the result with y, then subtracted from x. The value of g is the third return value of the function func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the result of the extended Euclidean algorithm for two integers a and b. If b is zero, it returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns a tuple containing the results of this recursive call, along with an additional calculated value based on the integer division of a by b.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that n is the length of list a, and k is an integer.

        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The list a remains unchanged, the value of n remains the same, the value of m remains the same, and the value of k is decreased by the sum of the differences between m and each element in a that is less than m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1, while the list 'a' remains unchanged, the value of 'n' remains the same, the value of 'm' remains the same, and the value of 'k' is decreased by the sum of the differences between 'm' and each element in 'a' that is less than 'm', with 'k' being greater than or equal to 0.
    #State: The list a remains unchanged, the value of n remains the same, the value of m remains the same, and the value of k is decreased by the sum of the differences between m and each element in a that is less than m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates the list 'a' of integers and adjusts the value of 'k' based on the elements in 'a' that are less than 'm'. It then returns 1 if 'k' is greater than or equal to 0 after the adjustment, and -1 otherwise. The function does not modify the list 'a' or the values of 'n' and 'm'.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and m is a positive integer
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, ans is the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared for all i from 1 to the square root of n.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared for all i from 1 to the square root of n, minus 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared for all i from 1 to the square root of n, then subtracts 1 from the result, where i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from the given function signature as it does not contain any variables. The function func_16() seems to be a part of a larger program and relies on other functions (func_10() and func_15()) to operate.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the standard output (sys.stdout) will have been written to func_10() number of times, with each write operation containing the string representation of the result of func_15() followed by a newline character. The state of other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Writes the string representation of the result of func_15() to the standard output (sys.stdout) a number of times equal to the result of func_10(), with each write operation followed by a newline character, without modifying any other variables.
