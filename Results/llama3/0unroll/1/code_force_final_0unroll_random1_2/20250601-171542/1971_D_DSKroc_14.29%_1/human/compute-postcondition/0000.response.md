Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, which is assigned from the input. The stdin still contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, as the input operation only reads the first integer from the stdin.
