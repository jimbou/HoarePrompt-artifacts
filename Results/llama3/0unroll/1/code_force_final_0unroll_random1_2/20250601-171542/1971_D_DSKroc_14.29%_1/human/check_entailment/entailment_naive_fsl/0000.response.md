Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because each time a '1' is followed by a '0', it means that the string is not sorted and a cut is needed to separate the '1' and '0'. The program then adds 1 to the count because the first piece of the string is always needed, regardless of whether it's sorted or not.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the string is already sorted, the program correctly outputs 1.
* When the string has only one character, the program correctly outputs 1.
* When the string has multiple characters and is not sorted, the program correctly outputs the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the string.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
