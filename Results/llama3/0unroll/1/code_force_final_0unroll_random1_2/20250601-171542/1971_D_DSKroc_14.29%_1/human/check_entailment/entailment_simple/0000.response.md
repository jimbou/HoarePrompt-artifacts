Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of "peaks", where a peak is defined as a position in the string where the current character is greater than the next character. This is done by comparing each character with its next character and incrementing the count whenever a peak is found. Finally, the count is incremented by 1 (to account for the last piece) and printed.

This approach is correct because it effectively identifies the minimum number of cuts needed to separate the string into sorted pieces. By counting the peaks, the program is essentially counting the number of times the string needs to be cut to separate the 1s from the 0s.

Correctness: **True**
