Output State: **The output state will contain t integers, each representing the number of "peaks" in the corresponding input string. A "peak" is defined as a position in the string where the current character is greater than the next character. The count of peaks for each string is incremented by 1 before being printed. The input strings themselves remain unchanged.**
