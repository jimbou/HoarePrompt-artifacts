Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It then calculates the total number of extroverts by adding the number of universals to the number of extroverts. If the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3 is greater than or equal to the number of universals, it prints the difference between the number of introverts and the integer division of the total number of extroverts by 3. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function repeats this process for each test case and outputs a list of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding test case.**
