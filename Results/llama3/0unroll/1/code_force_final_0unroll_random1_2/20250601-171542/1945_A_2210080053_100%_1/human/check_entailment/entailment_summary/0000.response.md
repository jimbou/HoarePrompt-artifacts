Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
2.  It then correctly parses each line into three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
3.  The program calculates the total number of extroverts by adding the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This is correct because universals can be treated as extroverts when calculating the number of tents needed.
4.  The program then checks if the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3 is greater than or equal to the number of universals. If this condition is true, it means that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If this condition is false, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and the program prints -1.
5.  If the condition is true, the program calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the integer division of the total number of extroverts by 3 from the number of introverts. This is correct because each introvert needs a separate tent, and the remaining tents can be filled with extroverts and universals.

Correctness: **True**
