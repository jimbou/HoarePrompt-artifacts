Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input and output formats.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when one or both wallets have only one coin. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
