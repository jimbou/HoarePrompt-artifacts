Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move, and the other player wins. The task is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns a string indicating the winner of the game.

The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins, `a + b`. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the game's rules ensure that the number of coins in each wallet will always be reduced by 1 in each turn, and the player who cannot make a valid move will be the one with an empty wallet.

`func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0 (even), it returns 'Bob', and otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

`func_2` is responsible for reading input from the user, calling `func_1` for each test case, and printing the results. It correctly reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, calls `func_1` with the input values, and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list.

Given the problem description and the execution states of the program, it is clear that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
