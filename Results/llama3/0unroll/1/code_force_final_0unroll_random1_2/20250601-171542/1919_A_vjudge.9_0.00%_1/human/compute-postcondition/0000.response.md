Output State: **t is an integer equal to the user's input, a and b are positive integers, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The first line of code prompts the user to enter the number of test cases and assigns the input to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer, its value is updated to the user's input, which is also an integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Stdin is now empty as the input has been consumed.
