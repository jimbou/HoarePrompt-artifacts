Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and the player who makes the last move will be the one who has an odd number of coins in their wallet.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases and the input values for `a` and `b` for each test case. It then calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately determines the winner of the game based on the problem's rules.

Correctness: **True**
