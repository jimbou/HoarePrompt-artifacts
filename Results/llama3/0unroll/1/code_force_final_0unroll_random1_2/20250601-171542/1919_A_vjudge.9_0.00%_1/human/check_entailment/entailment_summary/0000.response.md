Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn, and the game is lost by the player who cannot make a valid move. The game involves exchanging wallets and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet.

Function 1 (`func_1`) determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This function seems to be based on the idea that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the sum of the coins.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then calls Function 1 to determine the winner of each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the winners of each test case.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that Function 1 correctly determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins, and Function 2 correctly reads the input and calls Function 1 to determine the winners of each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
