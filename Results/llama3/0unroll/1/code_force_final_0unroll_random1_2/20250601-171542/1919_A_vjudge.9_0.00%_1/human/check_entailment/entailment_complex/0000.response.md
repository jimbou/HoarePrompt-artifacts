Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game involves players taking turns exchanging wallets or removing a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Function 1 takes two non-negative integers a and b as input and returns the winner of the game based on the sum of these integers. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'. This function correctly implements the logic of the game, as the winner is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then calls Function 1 to determine the winner for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the winners for each test case.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and prints the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
