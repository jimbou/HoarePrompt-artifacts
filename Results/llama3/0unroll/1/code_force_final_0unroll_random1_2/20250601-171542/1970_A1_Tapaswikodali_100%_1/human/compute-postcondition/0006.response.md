Functionality: **This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters by their balance (the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses) in ascending order and then by their position in descending order, and returns the sorted string. The function does not modify the input string, but rather creates a new sorted string as output.**
