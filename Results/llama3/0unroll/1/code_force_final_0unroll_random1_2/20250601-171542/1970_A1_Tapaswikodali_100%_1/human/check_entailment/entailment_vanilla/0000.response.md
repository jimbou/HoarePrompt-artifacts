Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. This involves computing the balance of each prefix of the sequence, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. The provided program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. However, `func_1` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this problem.

3. The `func_2` function takes a string `s` as input and performs the following operations:
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information of each character in the input string.
   - It iterates over the input string, computing the balance of each prefix and storing the balance, position, and character in the `balance_info` list.
   - It sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance and position of each character. However, the sorting key is incorrect. It should sort by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order. The current implementation sorts by balance in ascending order and then by position in ascending order (due to the `-` sign before `x.position`).
   - It forms a new string by joining the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints the result.

4. The program uses a class `BalanceInfo` to store the balance, position, and character information. However, the definition of this class is not provided in the given code snippet.

5. Assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined elsewhere in the code, the main issue with the program is the incorrect sorting key in the `func_2` function.

Correctness: **False**
