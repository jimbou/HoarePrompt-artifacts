#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes "balance" and "position", where "balance" is an integer and "position" is a non-negative integer.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and infoB, where both balances are integers and are not equal to each other.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes "balance" and "position", where "balance" is an integer and "position" is a non-negative integer. The balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position of infoB and the position of infoA, where both infoA and infoB have the same balance.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, based on their balance and position attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The length of balance_info is equal to n, balance is 0, and the value of n remains unchanged.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string of characters from the balance_info list, in ascending order by balance and then in descending order by position

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters by their balance (the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses) in ascending order and then by their position in descending order, and returns the sorted string. The function does not modify the input string, but rather creates a new sorted string as output.
