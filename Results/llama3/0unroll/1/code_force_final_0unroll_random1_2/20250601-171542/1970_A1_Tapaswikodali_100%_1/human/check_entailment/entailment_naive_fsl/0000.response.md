Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. The problem description states that the columns of the table should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the balance_info list in ascending order of balance and then in descending order of position, which is not the same as sorting the columns of the table.

A counterexample is the input "(()())". The correct output should be "()(())", but the program outputs "()(()())".
