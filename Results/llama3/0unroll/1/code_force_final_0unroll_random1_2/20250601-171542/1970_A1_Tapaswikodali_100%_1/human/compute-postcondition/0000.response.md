Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is an integer equal to the length of s, balance_info is an empty list, balance is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now equal to the length of `s`, which is an integer not exceeding 500,000. The `balance_info` list is empty, and the `balance` variable is set to 0.
