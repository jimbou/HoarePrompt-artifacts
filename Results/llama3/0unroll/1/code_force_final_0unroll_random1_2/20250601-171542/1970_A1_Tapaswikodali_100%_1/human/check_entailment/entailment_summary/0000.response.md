Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The operation involves computing the balance of each prefix of the sequence, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

Function 1 (`func_1`) is a comparison function that takes two `BalanceInfo` objects as input and returns a value indicating their order. It first compares the balances of the two objects, and if they are equal, it compares their positions. This function is used as a sorting key in Function 2.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation. It takes a string of balanced parentheses as input and creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, where each object represents a character in the input string along with its balance and position. The function then sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects using the `func_1` comparison function as the sorting key. Finally, it forms a new string by concatenating the characters of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints the result.

The execution summaries of the functions indicate that they behave as expected. Function 1 correctly compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position, and Function 2 correctly sorts the characters of the input string based on their balance and position and forms a new string from the sorted characters.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.
