The `print(result)` statement will print the string of characters from the `balance_info` list, in the order they appear after sorting.

Since the `balance_info` list is sorted in ascending order by balance and then in descending order by position, the characters in the `result` string will be arranged accordingly.

Output: **a string of characters from the balance_info list, in ascending order by balance and then in descending order by position**
