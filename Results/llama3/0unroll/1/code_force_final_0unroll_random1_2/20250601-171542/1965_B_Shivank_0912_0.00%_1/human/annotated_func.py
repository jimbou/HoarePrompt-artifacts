#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable "results" is now a list of pairs of integers where the first integer is always 25 and the second integer is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The number of pairs in the "results" list is equal to the number of pairs in the "cases" list. The variable "t" remains unchanged, and the "sequence" list also remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of pairs of integers where the first integer is always 25 and the second integer is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The number of pairs in the returned list is equal to the number of pairs in the "cases" list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) and a positive integer t as input, and returns a list of pairs of integers where the first integer is always 25 and the second integer is a list of 25 integers representing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The number of pairs in the returned list is equal to the number of pairs in the input list. The input variables t and cases remain unchanged.
