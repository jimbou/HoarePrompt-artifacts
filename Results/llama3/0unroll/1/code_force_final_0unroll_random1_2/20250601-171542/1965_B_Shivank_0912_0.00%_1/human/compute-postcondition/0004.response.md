Functionality: **This function takes a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) and a positive integer t as input, and returns a list of pairs of integers where the first integer is always 25 and the second integer is a list of 25 integers representing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The number of pairs in the returned list is equal to the number of pairs in the input list. The input variables t and cases remain unchanged.**
