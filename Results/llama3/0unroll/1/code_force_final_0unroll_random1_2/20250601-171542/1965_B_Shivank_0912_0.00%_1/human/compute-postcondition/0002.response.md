Output State: The variable "results" is now a list of pairs of integers where the first integer is always 25 and the second integer is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The number of pairs in the "results" list is equal to the number of pairs in the "cases" list. The variable "t" remains unchanged, and the "sequence" list also remains unchanged.
