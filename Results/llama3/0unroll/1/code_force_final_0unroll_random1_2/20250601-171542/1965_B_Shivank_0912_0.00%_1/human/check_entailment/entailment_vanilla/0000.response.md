Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program starts by reading the input data, which includes the number of test cases t and the parameters n and k for each test case. It then defines a function func_1 that takes t and the list of cases as input.

Inside func_1, the program initializes an empty list results to store the results for each test case. It also defines a sequence of 25 non-negative integers, where each integer is a power of 2 (2^i for i in range(25)).

The program then iterates over each test case (n, k) in the cases list. For each test case, it appends a tuple to the results list, where the first element is 25 (the size of the sequence) and the second element is the sequence itself.

Finally, the program prints the results for each test case, where the first line is the size of the sequence (25) and the second line is the sequence itself.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The sequence is always the same for all test cases, which is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]. This sequence does not satisfy the condition that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, because the sum of the first i elements of the sequence is always 2^i - 1, which can be equal to k for some values of i and k.

For example, if n = 10 and k = 7, the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64] has a subsequence [1, 2, 4] with a sum of 7, which violates the condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
