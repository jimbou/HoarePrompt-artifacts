Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

The code initializes an empty list called `results` and a list called `sequence` containing 25 integers, each being a power of 2 from 2^0 (which is 1) to 2^24. The initial state of `t` and `cases` remains unchanged as the code does not modify these variables.
