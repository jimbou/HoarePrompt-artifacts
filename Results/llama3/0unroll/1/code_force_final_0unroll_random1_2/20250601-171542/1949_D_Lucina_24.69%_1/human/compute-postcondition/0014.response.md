Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is as follows: n remains an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, where each integer represents the total number of 'F' characters in the input strings that correspond to the index of the integer, b is a list of n+1 integers, where each integer represents the total number of 'S' characters in the input strings that correspond to the index of the integer, xx is a list containing n strings, where each string is one of the input strings, sa is a list containing the indices of the input strings that contain only 'F' characters, sb is a list containing the indices of the input strings that contain only 'S' characters and the indices of the input strings that contain neither 'F' nor 'S' characters, and stdin is empty. The number of indices of input strings that contain only 'S' characters is larger than the number of indices of input strings that contain only 'F' characters.
