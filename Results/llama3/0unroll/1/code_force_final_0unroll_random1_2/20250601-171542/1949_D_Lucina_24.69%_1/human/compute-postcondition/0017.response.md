Functionality: **This function reads n+1 inputs from stdin, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and the next n inputs are strings of length n. It then analyzes these strings to determine the indices of strings that contain only 'F' characters, only 'S' characters, or neither. If the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters, it prints the input strings with '?' characters replaced by 'F' if the string index or column index is in the list of 'F' indices, and 'S' otherwise. Otherwise, it prints the input strings with '?' characters replaced by 'S' if the string index or column index is in the list of 'S' indices, and 'F' otherwise.**
