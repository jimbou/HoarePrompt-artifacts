Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the type of transition videos for each pair of scenarios, ensuring that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than ⌈3n/4⌉ transition videos of the same type in a row.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures. It then identifies the indices of the input strings that contain only 'F' characters or only 'S' characters, and stores them in the lists sa and sb, respectively.

The program then checks if the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters. If this is the case, it appends the indices of the empty strings to the list sa. Otherwise, it appends the indices of the empty strings to the list sb.

Finally, the program iterates over the input strings and replaces the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the lists sa and sb. The replacement is done in such a way that the resulting string satisfies the condition that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than ⌈3n/4⌉ transition videos of the same type in a row.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the output is valid according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
