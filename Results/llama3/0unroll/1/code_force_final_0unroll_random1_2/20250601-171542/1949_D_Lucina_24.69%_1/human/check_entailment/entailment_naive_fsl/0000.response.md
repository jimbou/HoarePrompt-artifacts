Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem described. It takes into account the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description and produces a valid solution.

The program first reads the input and initializes variables to keep track of the number of 'F' and 'S' characters for each scenario. It then identifies the scenarios that are already decided to be funny or scary and separates them into two lists.

The program then determines which type of transition video ('F' or 'S') should be assigned to the undecided scenarios. It does this by comparing the number of already decided funny and scary scenarios. If there are more funny scenarios, it assigns the undecided scenarios to be scary, and vice versa.

Finally, the program constructs the full transition video plan by replacing the '?' characters with the assigned type of transition video. It ensures that the resulting plan satisfies the condition that no matter the order of the scenarios, there will not be more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type consecutively.

The program's logic and implementation seem to be correct, and it should produce a valid solution for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
