Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly reads the input, analyzes the strings to determine the indices of strings that contain only 'F' characters, only 'S' characters, or neither, and then prints the input strings with '?' characters replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program also handles the case where the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters, and the case where the number of strings with only 'S' characters is greater than the number of strings with only 'F' characters. The program's logic is sound and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
