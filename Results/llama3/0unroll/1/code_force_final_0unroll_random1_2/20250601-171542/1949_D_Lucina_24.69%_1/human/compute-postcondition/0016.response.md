Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, where each integer represents the total number of 'F' characters in the input strings that correspond to the index of the integer, b is a list of n+1 integers, where each integer represents the total number of 'S' characters in the input strings that correspond to the index of the integer, xx is a list containing n strings, where each string is one of the input strings, sa is a list containing the indices of the input strings that contain only 'F' characters or are empty strings, sb is a list containing the indices of the input strings that contain only 'S' characters, stdin is empty. If the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters, the list sa contains the indices of all the input strings that contain only 'F' characters or are empty strings, while the other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the loop has executed n times, and for each iteration, a new string nx has been created and printed. The string nx is created by iterating over the characters of the string xx[i] and replacing '?' with 'S' if the index i or j is in the list sb[:n // 4], and 'F' otherwise. The lists a, b, xx, sa, sb, and stdin remain unchanged.***
