Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned from the first input in stdin, which is an integer between 2 and 24. The lists `a` and `b` have been initialized with `n+1` zeros each. The list `xx` contains a single empty string. Stdin now contains `n` inputs, which are strings of length `n`, where each character can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'.
