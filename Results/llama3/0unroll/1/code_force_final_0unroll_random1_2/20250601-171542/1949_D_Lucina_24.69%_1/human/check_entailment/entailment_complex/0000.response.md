Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the indices of strings that contain only 'F' characters, only 'S' characters, or neither, and then uses this information to replace '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The program first reads the input strings and counts the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each string. It then identifies the indices of strings that contain only 'F' characters, only 'S' characters, or neither. If the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters, it replaces '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' if the string index or column index is in the list of 'F' indices, and 'S' otherwise. Otherwise, it replaces '?' characters in the input strings with 'S' if the string index or column index is in the list of 'S' indices, and 'F' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of strings with only 'F' characters is greater than or equal to the number of strings with only 'S' characters, and the case where the number of strings with only 'S' characters is greater than the number of strings with only 'F' characters. It also correctly handles the case where a string contains neither 'F' nor 'S' characters.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
