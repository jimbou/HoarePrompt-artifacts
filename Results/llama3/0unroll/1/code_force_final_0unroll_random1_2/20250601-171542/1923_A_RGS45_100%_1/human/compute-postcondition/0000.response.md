The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1) where `a_i = 0` means the i-th cell is free and `a_i = 1` means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1) where `a_i = 0` means the i-th cell is free and `a_i = 1` means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1) where `a_i = 0` means the i-th cell is free and `a_i = 1` means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**
