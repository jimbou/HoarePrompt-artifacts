Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. It does this by finding the first and last occurrences of '1' in the string, slicing the string to get the substring between these two points, and then counting the number of '0's in this substring.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When there are no free cells between the chips (in which case the count of '0's is 0).
* When there are free cells between the chips (in which case the count of '0's is greater than 0).
* When the chips are already in a single block (in which case the count of '0's is 0).
* When the input string contains only '0's (in which case the find method returns -1, but the slicing operation still works correctly).

The program also handles edge cases such as an input string of length 1, or an input string that contains only '1's.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
