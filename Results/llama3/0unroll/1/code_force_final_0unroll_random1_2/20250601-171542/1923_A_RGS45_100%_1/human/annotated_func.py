#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The number of free cells between the first and last cell containing a chip in each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of free cells between the first and last cell containing a chip in each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, only producing output for each test case.
