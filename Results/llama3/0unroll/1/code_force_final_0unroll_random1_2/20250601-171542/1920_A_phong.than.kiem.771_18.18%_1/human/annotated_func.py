#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is provided by the user as input, regardless of the initial value of the boolean variable isOne, which is False.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean variable isOne. If isOne is False, it prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it. If isOne is True, it returns the integer 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value and to_int is a boolean value.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()

    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, `items` is a list of characters in `line`.
    if to_int :

    else :

        #The program returns a list of strings or characters from the string 'line'. If 'space' is true, the list contains strings split from 'line'. If 'space' is false, the list contains individual characters from 'line'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, it splits the input string into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input string as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers; otherwise, it returns them as strings or characters. The function returns a list of either integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Concatenates integers from a list into a string, separating each integer with a specified symbol.

    #State: indices is a list of indices of all occurrences of substring in string, index is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices of all occurrences of substring in string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns their indices. It takes two parameters: the original string and the substring to search for. The function returns a list of indices where the substring is found, covering all potential cases including multiple occurrences, no occurrences, and edge cases. The input strings remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value such that it may or may not exist in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the element exists in the list 'arr'. If the element does not exist in 'arr', the program returns an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a given element within a list. If the element is found, it returns a list of indices corresponding to the element's positions in the list. If the element is not found, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is a value of any type.

    #State: The loop will return the first sub-array in 'arr' where the element at the 'index' position matches the 'value'. If no match is found, the loop will not return anything (i.e., it will implicitly return None). The state of 'arr', 'index', and 'value' remains unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no match was found in the sub-arrays of 'arr' at the specified 'index' position for the given 'value'. The state of 'arr', 'index', and 'value' remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a sub-array in a given 2D array where the element at a specified index position matches a given value. It returns the first matching sub-array if found, otherwise it returns None. The function does not modify the original 2D array, index, or value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), then n lines each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of missing integers within a specified range. It takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). The function then determines the range [start, end] based on the input values where t is 1 or 2, and counts the numbers in the list 'num' that fall within this range. If start is greater than end, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.
