This function calculates the number of missing integers within a specified range. It takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). The function then determines the range [start, end] based on the input values where t is 1 or 2, and counts the numbers in the list 'num' that fall within this range. If start is greater than end, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.
