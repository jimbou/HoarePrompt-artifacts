The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers a and x. The second line assigns -1 to `start`. The third line assigns 1000000000.0 to `end`. The fourth line assigns an empty list to `num`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers a and x.**
