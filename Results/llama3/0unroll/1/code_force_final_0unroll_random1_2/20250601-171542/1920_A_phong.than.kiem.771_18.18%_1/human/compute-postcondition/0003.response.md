Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the maximum of the initial `start` and all the values `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum of the initial `end` and all the values `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all the values `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, all the initial variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` retain their initial values and properties. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `count_num` which is initialized to 0. The stdin remains empty as there are no inputs.
