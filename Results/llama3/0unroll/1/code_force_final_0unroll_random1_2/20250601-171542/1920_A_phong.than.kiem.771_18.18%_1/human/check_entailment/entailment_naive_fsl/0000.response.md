Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the start and end values to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively, and then iterates through each constraint. For type 1 constraints, it updates the start value if the current value is greater than the start value. For type 2 constraints, it updates the end value if the current value is less than the end value. For type 3 constraints, it adds the value to a list of numbers to be excluded.

After iterating through all constraints, it calculates the count of numbers that need to be excluded and subtracts this count from the total count of numbers between the start and end values (inclusive). If the start value is greater than the end value, it returns 0, indicating that there are no valid values for k.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no valid values for k (i.e., when the start value is greater than the end value). It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple type 3 constraints, as it only counts each excluded number once.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
