You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), then n lines each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, start is the maximum of the initial start and all the values v where t is 1, end is the minimum of the initial end and all the values v where t is 2, num is a list containing all the values v where t is 3, stdin contains no inputs.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count_num` is the number of integers in `num` that are between `start` and `end` inclusive.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `count_num` is the number of integers in `num` that are between `start` and `end` inclusive, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
