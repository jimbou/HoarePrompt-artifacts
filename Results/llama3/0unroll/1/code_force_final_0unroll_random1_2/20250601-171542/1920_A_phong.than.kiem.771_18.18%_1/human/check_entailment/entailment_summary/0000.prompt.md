Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean variable isOne. If isOne is False, it prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it. If isOne is True, it returns the integer 1.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function takes a string input and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, it splits the input string into substrings separated by spaces; otherwise, it treats the input string as individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts the resulting substrings or characters into integers; otherwise, it returns them as strings or characters. The function returns a list of either integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Concatenates integers from a list into a string, separating each integer with a specified symbol.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns their indices. It takes two parameters: the original string and the substring to search for. The function returns a list of indices where the substring is found, covering all potential cases including multiple occurrences, no occurrences, and edge cases. The input strings remain unchanged.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a given element within a list. If the element is found, it returns a list of indices corresponding to the element's positions in the list. If the element is not found, it returns an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  This function searches for a sub-array in a given 2D array where the element at a specified index position matches a given value. It returns the first matching sub-array if found, otherwise it returns None. The function does not modify the original 2D array, index, or value.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:

        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    if start > end:
        return 0
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  This function calculates the number of missing integers within a specified range. It takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). The function then determines the range [start, end] based on the input values where t is 1 or 2, and counts the numbers in the list 'num' that fall within this range. If start is greater than end, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.
