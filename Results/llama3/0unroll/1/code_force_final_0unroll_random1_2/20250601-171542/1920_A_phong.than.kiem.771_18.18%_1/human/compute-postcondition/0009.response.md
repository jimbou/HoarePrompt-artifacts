Output State: **The program returns the difference between the total numbers in the range from start to end (inclusive) and the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range, but only if the total numbers in the range are greater than or equal to the count of numbers in 'num' that fall within this range; otherwise, it returns 0.**

In this output state, `end - start + 1` represents the total numbers in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive), and `count_num` is the number of integers in `num` that are between `start` and `end` inclusive.
