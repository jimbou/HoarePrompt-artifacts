Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the maximum number of consecutive integers that can be formed using the integers in the list, considering the constraints x and y, and prints the result for each test case. The function iterates over the test cases, processing each one independently, and terminates after all test cases have been processed, leaving the output state as the collection of results printed for each test case.**
