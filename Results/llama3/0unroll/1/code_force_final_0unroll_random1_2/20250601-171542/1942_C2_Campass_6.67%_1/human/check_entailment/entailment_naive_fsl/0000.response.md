Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first sorts the chosen vertices and calculates the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these vertices. Then, it iterates over the sorted list of vertices and calculates the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of additional vertices that can be chosen is less than the number of vertices needed to form a triangle. In this case, it adds the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the available vertices.

The program also correctly handles the case where the total number of vertices (chosen and additional) exceeds the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, it limits the total number of vertices to the number of sides of the polygon minus 2.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
