The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers, n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x), where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
