Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed 'Yes' or 'No' to the console based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `n` and `m` have been read from the input and used in the conditions, but they do not persist after each iteration. The final state is that the loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.**
