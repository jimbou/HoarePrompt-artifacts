Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower can be either even or odd, and it can be changed by either adding or removing a cube.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If n is equal to m, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding m cubes.
* If m is greater than n, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes because there are not enough moves to add that many cubes.
* If m is equal to n - 1, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding n - 1 cubes and then removing one cube.
* If both m and n are even, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding m/2 pairs of cubes.
* If both m and n are odd, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding (m - 1)/2 pairs of cubes and then adding one cube.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
