Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program takes into account the conditions where n and m are equal, m is one less than n, or both n and m are even or odd.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the program's logic is incomplete. The program only checks for specific conditions and does not consider all possible scenarios. For instance, it does not account for cases where m is greater than n but still an even or odd number.

Moreover, the program's logic is not entirely accurate. For example, the condition `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is not always true. If n is 4 and m is 3, the program will print 'Yes', but it's not possible to build a tower with 3 cubes after 4 moves.

Additionally, the program's use of `elif` statements is not efficient. A more concise and efficient approach would be to use a single conditional statement that checks if the difference between n and m is even.

Considering these points, the program's correctness is questionable.

Correctness: **False**
