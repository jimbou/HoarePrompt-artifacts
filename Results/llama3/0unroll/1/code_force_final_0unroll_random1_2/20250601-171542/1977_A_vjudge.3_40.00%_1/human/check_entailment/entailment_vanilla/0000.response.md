Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m.

1. If n == m, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can simply add 1 cube at a time to reach m cubes.

2. If m > n, the program prints 'No', which is correct because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.

3. If m == n - 1, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add 1 cube at a time and then remove 1 cube to reach m cubes.

4. The program then checks the parity of m and n. If both are even or both are odd, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach an even number of cubes, and he can add or remove a single cube to reach an odd number of cubes.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'.

However, there is a flaw in the program. It does not consider the case where m is less than n but not equal to n - 1. In such cases, Nikita can still reach m cubes by adding and removing cubes appropriately.

For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, the program will print 'No', but Nikita can actually reach 3 cubes by adding 1 cube at a time and then removing 2 cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
