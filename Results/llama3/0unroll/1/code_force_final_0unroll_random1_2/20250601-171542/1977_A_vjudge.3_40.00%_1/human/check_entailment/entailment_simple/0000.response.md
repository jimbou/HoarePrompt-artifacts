Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program iterates through each test case, reading the values of n and m from the input.

The program's logic is based on the following conditions:

1. If n equals m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time (Yes).
2. If m is greater than n, it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves (No).
3. If m is one less than n, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube (Yes).
4. If both m and n are even, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs (Yes).
5. If both m and n are odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs and then adding or removing one cube (Yes).
6. In all other cases, it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes (No).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. The use of elif statements ensures that the program checks each condition in order and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
