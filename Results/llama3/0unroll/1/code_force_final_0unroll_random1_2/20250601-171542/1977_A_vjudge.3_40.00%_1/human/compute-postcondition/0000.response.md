Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line from stdin, which contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100).
	* `int()` converts the input string to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since the first line of stdin is consumed by the `input()` function, the remaining lines in stdin are still present, but the first line is no longer available.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), with `t-1` lines remaining.**

Note that I've included the fact that `t-1` lines remain in stdin, as the first line was consumed by the `input()` function.
