Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m. It then evaluates the relationship between n and m for each test case, printing 'Yes' if n and m are equal, or if m is one less than n, or if both n and m are even or both odd. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, but instead, prints the results directly to the console, and its execution terminates after processing all test cases.**
