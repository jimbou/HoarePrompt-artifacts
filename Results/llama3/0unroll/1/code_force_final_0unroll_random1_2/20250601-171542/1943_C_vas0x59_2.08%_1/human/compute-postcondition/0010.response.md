Postcondition: ***`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node `a` to node `b`, `previous` contains the previous node in the shortest path from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `d` contains the shortest distances from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of adjacent nodes in the graph, `a` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `0`, `b` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `a`, and `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even***
