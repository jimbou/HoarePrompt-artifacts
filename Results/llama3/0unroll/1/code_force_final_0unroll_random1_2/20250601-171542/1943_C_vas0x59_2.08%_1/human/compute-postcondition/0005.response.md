Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node `a` to node `b`, `previous` contains the previous node in the shortest path from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `d` contains the shortest distances from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of adjacent nodes in the graph, `a` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `0`, `b` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `a`, and `ops` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ops` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
