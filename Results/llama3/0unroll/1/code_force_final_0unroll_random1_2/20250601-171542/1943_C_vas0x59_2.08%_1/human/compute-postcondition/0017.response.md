The code prints the length of `ops` which contains pairs or tuples of indices depending on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even. The length of `ops` is the number of pairs or tuples it contains.
Output: **the length of ops (where ops is a list of pairs or tuples of indices depending on whether the length of path_ba is odd or even)**
