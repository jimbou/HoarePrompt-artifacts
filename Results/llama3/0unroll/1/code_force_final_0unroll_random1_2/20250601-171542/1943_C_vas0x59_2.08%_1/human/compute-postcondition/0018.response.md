Output: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node `a` to node `b`, `previous` contains the previous node in the shortest path from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `d` contains the shortest distances from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of adjacent nodes in the graph, `a` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `0`, `b` is the index of the node with the maximum shortest distance from node `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains `ci + 1` pairs, where each pair contains the node `c` and an index from `0` to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2, and the following is printed:**

**If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**

*   For each pair `(c, i)` in `ops`, a string in the format `"{c + 1} {i}"` is printed, where `c` is the node and `i` is the index.

**If the length of `path_ba` is even:**

*   For each tuple `((c1, i), (c2, i))` in `ops`, two strings in the format `"{c1 + 1} {i}"` and `"{c2 + 1} {i}"` are printed, where `c1` and `c2` are the nodes and `i` is the index.

**In both cases, the strings are separated by newline characters (`\n`).**
