Output State: The list `ops` contains pairs of indices that correspond to the nodes in the shortest path from node `a` to node `b`, where the first element of each pair is `c1` and the second element is an index `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `path_ba` minus `c1`, stepping by 2, and the second element of each pair is `c2` and the second element is the same index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
