Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list.**

The code defines a docstring that describes the purpose of the code, but it does not affect the state of the variables. The last line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected by the code.
