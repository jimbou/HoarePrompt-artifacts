Functionality: This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes in a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases and a list 'test_cases' containing sublists with two positive integers 'n' and 'm', and a string 'a' of 'n' characters. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in each test case. The function iterates through each test case, counts the frequency of each character in the string 'a', and calculates the total number of missing characters by summing the difference between 'm' and the frequency of each character. The function then appends this total to the 'results' list and returns it.
