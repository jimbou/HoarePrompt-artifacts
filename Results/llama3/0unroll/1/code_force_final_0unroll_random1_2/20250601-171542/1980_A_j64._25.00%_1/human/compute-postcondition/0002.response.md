Output State: The variable results is a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in each test case. The variable t is still a positive integer, and test_cases is still a list of lists, where each sublist contains two positive integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
