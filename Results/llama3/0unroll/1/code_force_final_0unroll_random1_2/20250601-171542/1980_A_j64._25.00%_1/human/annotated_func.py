#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains the number of problems in the bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and a string of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of missing characters in each test case, which is the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.
