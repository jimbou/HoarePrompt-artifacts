Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. However, the provided function `func_1` does not perform the decoding operation correctly.

The function `func_1` takes a string `b` as input, which is the encoded string. It then creates a list of unique characters from the string `b` in descending order. However, it does not use this list to decode the string. Instead, it replaces duplicate characters in the string `b` with unique characters in descending order, which is not the correct decoding operation.

The correct decoding operation would involve replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the list of unique characters in descending order. However, the provided function does not perform this operation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
