Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the given string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm.

The decoding algorithm should work as follows:

* First, construct the auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct letters of the string `b`, written in alphabetical order.
* Then, for each character in the string `b`, replace it with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

However, the given function does not correctly implement this algorithm. It seems to be implementing an encoding algorithm instead of a decoding algorithm. It also has several other issues, such as modifying the string `s` while iterating over it, and using the `replace` method which replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, not just the first one.

Correctness: **False**
