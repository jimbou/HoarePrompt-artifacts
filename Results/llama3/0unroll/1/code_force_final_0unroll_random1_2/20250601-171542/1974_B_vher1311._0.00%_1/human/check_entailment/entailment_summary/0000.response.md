Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm, but the provided program does not perform the decoding correctly.

The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string, but it does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm. The decoding algorithm requires replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order. However, the function `func_1` does not construct the auxiliary string `r` correctly and does not perform the correct replacements.

Instead, the function `func_1` replaces duplicate characters in the input string with unique characters in descending order and returns a string of unique characters. This is not the correct decoding algorithm.

Correctness: **False**
