Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= len(cities), prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities` has been updated to be a list of `n-1` zeros, where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and the length of the `cities` list. The values of `cities` and `n` remain unchanged.
