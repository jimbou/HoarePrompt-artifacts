Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and a positive integer n as input, and returns a list of n-1 integers. The returned list contains the minimum absolute difference between each element in the input list and its adjacent element, or 1 if the adjacent element is closer. The function effectively calculates the minimum distance between each city and its neighboring cities, considering both the previous and next city in the list.
