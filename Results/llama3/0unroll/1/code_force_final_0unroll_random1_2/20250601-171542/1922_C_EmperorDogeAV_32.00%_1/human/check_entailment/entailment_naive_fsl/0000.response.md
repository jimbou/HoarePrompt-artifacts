Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first calculates the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. Then, it calculates the prefix sum of the distances to the closest city for both forward and backward directions. Finally, it uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles the case when the closest city is the next city or the previous city. It also correctly handles the case when the closest city is the same for multiple cities.

The program also correctly handles the case when the input cities are not in ascending order. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the closest city for each city even when the input cities are not in ascending order.

The program also correctly handles the case when the number of cities is 2. In this case, the closest city for each city is the other city, and the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another.

The program also correctly handles the case when the number of queries is 0. In this case, the program does not print anything, which is correct.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
