Functionality: **This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and a positive integer n as input, and returns a list of n-1 integers. Each element in the output list is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding element in the input list and the next element, whichever is smaller. The function effectively compares each element in the input list with its next element and returns a list of the smaller differences or 1 if the difference is greater than 1.**
