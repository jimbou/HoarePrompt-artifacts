Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances to the closest city for both forward and backward directions. Then, for each query, it simply calculates the difference between the prefix sums of the destination city and the source city to find the minimum number of coins required.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the closest city to 1 (indicating that the closest city is the next city), otherwise, it sets the closest city to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The prefix sum calculations are also correct, as they simply sum up the distances to the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions.

Finally, the query handling is correct, as it simply calculates the difference between the prefix sums of the destination city and the source city to find the minimum number of coins required.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
