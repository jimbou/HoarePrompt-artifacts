Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and their prefix/suffix maximums. It uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

Function `func_1` is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo `1000000007`. This is done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns two values. If `b` is zero, it returns `1` and `0`. If `a` is less than `b`, it calls itself with `b` and `a` as arguments and returns the second and first return values, respectively. If `a` is a multiple of `b`, it returns `1` and the negation of the difference between the integer division of `a` by `b` and `1`. Otherwise, it calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` as arguments, and returns the second return value and the difference between the first return value and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and the second return value.

Function `func_2` is used to calculate the product of two numbers `a` and `b` modulo `1000000007`. It calls `func_1` with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments, and returns the product of `a` and the result of `func_1`, modulo `1000000007`.

The main program uses these functions to calculate the number of suitable permutations. It first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is equal to `1` and the last suffix maximum is equal to `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function and prints the result.
