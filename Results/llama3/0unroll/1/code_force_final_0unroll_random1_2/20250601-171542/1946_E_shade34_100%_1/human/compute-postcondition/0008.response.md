Output State: **The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The difference between this integer and 1 is then negated, resulting in a negative integer or zero.**
