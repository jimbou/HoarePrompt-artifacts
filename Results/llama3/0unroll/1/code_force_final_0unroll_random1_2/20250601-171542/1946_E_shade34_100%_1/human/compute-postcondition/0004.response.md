Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`, `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code. The code only assigns the return values of `func_1(b, a)` to `c` and `d`, respectively. The relationship between `a` and `b` also remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`. The specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
