This function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of `a` and the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007. The function does not modify the input variables `a` and `b`. The result is a non-negative integer that represents the product of `a` and the return value of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, wrapped around the modulus 1000000007.
