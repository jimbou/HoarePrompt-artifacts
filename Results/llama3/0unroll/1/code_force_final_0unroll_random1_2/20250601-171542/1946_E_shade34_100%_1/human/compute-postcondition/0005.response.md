Output State: **The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`.**

Note: Since the initial state does not provide the implementation of `func_1(b, a)`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`. However, we can describe the output state based on the given information.
