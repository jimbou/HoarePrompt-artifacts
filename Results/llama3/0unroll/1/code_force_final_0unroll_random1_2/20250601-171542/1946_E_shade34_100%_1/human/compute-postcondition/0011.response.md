Output State: **The program returns two values: `d` which is the returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`.**

Note: Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the given information.
