Output State: **The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and the return value `c` of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007.**

In this output state, the return value `c` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `b` (a non-negative integer) and `1000000007`. The product of `a` and `c` is then taken modulo `1000000007`, resulting in a value between 0 and 1000000006 (inclusive).
