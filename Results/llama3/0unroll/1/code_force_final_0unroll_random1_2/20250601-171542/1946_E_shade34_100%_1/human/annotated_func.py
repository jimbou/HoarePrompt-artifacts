#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1, which is an integer, and 0, which is also an integer and equals the current value of variable b.
    #State: *a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The difference between this integer and 1 is then negated, resulting in a negative integer or zero.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: `d` which is the returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the second and first return values of func_1, respectively. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second return value of func_1 and the difference between the first return value of func_1 and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and the return value `c` of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of `a` and the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007. The function does not modify the input variables `a` and `b`. The result is a non-negative integer that represents the product of `a` and the return value of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, wrapped around the modulus 1000000007.
