Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The program only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but does not use them to solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions, but the program does not provide any logic to do so.

For example, if the input is `n = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = 3, p = [1, 2], s = [2, 3, 4]`, the program does not provide any output, whereas the correct output should be `3` (the permutations `[1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3, 1], [3, 4, 2, 1]`).

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
