Functionality: **This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the second and first return values of func_1, respectively. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second return value of func_1 and the difference between the first return value of func_1 and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second return value of func_1.**
