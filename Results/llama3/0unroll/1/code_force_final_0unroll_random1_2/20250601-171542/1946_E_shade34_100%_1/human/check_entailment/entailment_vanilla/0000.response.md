Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo `1000000007`. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `c` and `d` such that `a * c + b * d = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`. If `a` is less than `b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively. If `a` is a multiple of `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with `b` and `a % b` and returns the result.

`func_2` is used to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and `b` modulo `1000000007`. It calls `func_1` to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` and then multiplies `a` with the result.

The main part of the program is missing, but based on the problem description, it should read the input, calculate the number of permutations using the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and output the result modulo `1000000007`.

Assuming the main part of the program is correct, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
