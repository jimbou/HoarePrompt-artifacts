Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. The given program does not directly solve this problem. However, it provides a set of functions for reading input and performing basic operations.

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem and the provided functions. The problem requires sorting the array and finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

The provided functions do not directly solve this problem. However, function 4 (func_4) sorts the input array, which is a necessary step in solving the problem. The other functions do not contribute to solving the problem.

Since the program does not provide a complete solution to the problem, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
