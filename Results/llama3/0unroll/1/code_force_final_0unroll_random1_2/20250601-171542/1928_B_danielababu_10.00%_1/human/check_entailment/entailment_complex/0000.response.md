Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to the array. The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task.

The main logic of the program is as follows:

1.  Read the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_1()`.
2.  For each test case, read the length of the array (`n`) using `func_1()` and the array elements using `func_3()`.
3.  Calculate the maximum element (`m`) in the array.
4.  Create a new array (`new`) by subtracting each element in the original array from `m` and adding 1. This is done to shift the elements to the range [1, n].
5.  Sort the `new` array in ascending order.
6.  Create a set (`ans`) to store unique elements from the `new` array that are within the range [1, n].
7.  Print the size of the `ans` set, which represents the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

The program uses the following functions:

*   `func_1()`: Reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as is.
*   `func_3()`: Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
