#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a non-negative integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a non-negative integer that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or additional processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were inputted from stdin as a space-separated list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, where each string is converted to a string type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to a string type, and returns a map object containing the converted strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters in the string from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings sorted in ascending order, where the strings are the input space-separated list of strings from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of strings.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in a list of non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of non-negative integers and returns the result as a new list. The input list remains unchanged. The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a list of the same length, where each element is the product of all elements up to that point in the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-zero integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):

    #State: arr is a list of non-zero integers, ans is a list of integers where each element is the product of all the elements in arr to its right, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the product of all the elements in the list 'arr' to its right.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-zero integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the product of all the elements in the input list to its right. The input list remains unchanged.
