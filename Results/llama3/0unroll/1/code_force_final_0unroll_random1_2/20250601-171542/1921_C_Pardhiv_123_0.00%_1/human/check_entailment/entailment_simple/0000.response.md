Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially `b`.
3. It then reads the moments at which messages need to be sent `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
4. The program iterates over the moments, starting from the second moment (index 1). For each moment, it calculates the minimum charge consumption between turning off and on (`b`) and the charge consumption per unit of time (`a`) multiplied by the time difference between the current moment and the previous moment (`ls[i] - ls[i - 1]`).
5. It subtracts the minimum charge consumption from the remaining charge `f`.
6. After iterating over all moments, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all the messages. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles the case where the phone's charge is 0 at the beginning, and it correctly handles the case where the time difference between two moments is 0.

Correctness: **True**
