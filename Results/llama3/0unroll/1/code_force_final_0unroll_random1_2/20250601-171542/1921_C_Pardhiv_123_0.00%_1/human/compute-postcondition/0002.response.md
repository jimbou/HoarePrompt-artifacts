Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether a given amount of fuel is sufficient to cover a sequence of distances. It iterates through each test case, calculating the remaining fuel after traversing the distances, and prints 'YES' if the fuel is sufficient and 'NO' otherwise. The function continues processing test cases until all inputs have been exhausted.**
