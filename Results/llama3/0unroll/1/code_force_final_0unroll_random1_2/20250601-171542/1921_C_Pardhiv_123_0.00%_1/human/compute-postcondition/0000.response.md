The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i+1}).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i+1}).**
