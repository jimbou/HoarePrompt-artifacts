Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking the parity of the sides of the rectangle and the difference between the sides. However, the conditions in the if-elif-else statement are not correctly implemented.

The first condition checks if both sides are even, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed. The second condition checks if the difference between the sides is equal to the negative of one of the sides, which is not a necessary condition. The third condition checks if the difference between the sides is odd, which is not a sufficient condition.

The correct approach is to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sides is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means that the rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and therefore another rectangle can be formed.

However, the given program does not check for the GCD of the sides, and therefore it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
