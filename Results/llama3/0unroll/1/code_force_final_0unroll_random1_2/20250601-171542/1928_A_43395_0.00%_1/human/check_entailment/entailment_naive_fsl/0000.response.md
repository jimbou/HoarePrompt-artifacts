Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 2 2, the program prints 'yes', but according to the problem description, the 2 x 2 rectangle can only be cut into two 1 x 2 rectangles, and from these, only the 1 x 4 rectangle can be formed, which is considered the same as the 2 x 2 rectangle. Therefore, the correct output should be 'no'.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly check if the two resulting rectangles can be used to form a different rectangle. The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is not sufficient to determine if a different rectangle can be formed. A correct solution would need to check if the greatest common divisor of a and b is greater than 1, and if so, print 'yes', otherwise print 'no'.
