The loop iterates over the range of the integer t, which is read from the standard input. In each iteration, it reads two integers a and b from the standard input, and then checks the conditions in the if-elif-else statement.

The conditions in the if-elif-else statement are:

1. If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes'.
2. If the difference between a and b is equal to the negative of either a or b, it prints 'no'.
3. If the difference between a and b is odd (i.e., (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0), it prints 'yes'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be a sequence of 'yes' or 'no' strings, one for each pair of integers a and b read from the standard input.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **A sequence of 'yes' or 'no' strings, one for each pair of integers a and b read from the standard input, indicating whether the conditions in the if-elif-else statement are met for each pair.**
