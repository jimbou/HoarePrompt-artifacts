This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, calculates the minimum number of cuts required to make the '1's and '0's in each string alternate, and prints the results. If a string already has alternating '1's and '0's, it outputs 1. If a string consists of only '0's or only '1's, it outputs the number of '1's or '0's in the string plus 1. The function processes multiple strings, with the number of strings specified by the first input, and outputs the results for each string on a separate line.
