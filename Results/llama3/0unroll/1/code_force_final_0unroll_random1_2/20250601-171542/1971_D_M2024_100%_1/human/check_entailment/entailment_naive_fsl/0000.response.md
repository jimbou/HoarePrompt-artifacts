Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means that the string is already sorted and the number of pieces needed is cut1 + 1. Otherwise, the number of pieces needed is cut0 + cut1.

This logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces, the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string, and all the pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, the program is correct.
