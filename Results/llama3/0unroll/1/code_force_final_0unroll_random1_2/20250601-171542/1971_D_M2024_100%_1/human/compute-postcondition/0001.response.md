Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line will be the total number of cuts required to make all the '1's and '0's in the corresponding input string s alternate. If the string already has alternating '1's and '0's, the output will be 1. If the string has only '0's or only '1's, the output will be the number of '1's or '0's in the string plus 1.**
