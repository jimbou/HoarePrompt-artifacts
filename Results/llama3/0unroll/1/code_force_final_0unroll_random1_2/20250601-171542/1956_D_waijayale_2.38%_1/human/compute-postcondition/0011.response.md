Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `r` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and its return value has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain the same as before. However, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and its return value has been returned. This means that the function has been executed with the new arguments, and its result has been obtained. The state of the program has been updated to reflect this new information.
