Postcondition: **l is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), r is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive), s is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), mx is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r+1], and pos is the index of mx in the original list a. The current value of pos is not equal to l.**
