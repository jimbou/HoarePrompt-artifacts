Functionality: **This function, `recursive_maximize_sum`, takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and two integers `l` and `r` as input, where `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. It calculates the sum `s` of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) and checks if `s` is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive). If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`, appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1`. If `s` is greater than the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive), it finds the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` and its index `pos` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, it recursively calls itself with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. The function modifies the input list `a` and the list `ops` based on the conditions met.**
