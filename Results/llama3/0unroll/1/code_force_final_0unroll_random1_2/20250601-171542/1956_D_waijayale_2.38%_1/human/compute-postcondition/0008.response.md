Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `r` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`, and its return value has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`, and its return value has been returned. The values of the variables `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
