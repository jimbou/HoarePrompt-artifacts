Output State: **n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s, m, and ops are the output values of func_2(a), stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the same as the input integer, which is a positive integer less or equal than 18. The value of `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, which are the input integers. The values of `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the output values of the function `func_2(a)`, which are not specified in the problem. Stdin is empty because two inputs have been read.
