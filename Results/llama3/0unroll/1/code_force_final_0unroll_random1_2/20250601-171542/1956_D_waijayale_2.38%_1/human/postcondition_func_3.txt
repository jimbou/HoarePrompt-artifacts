This function reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) followed by a space-separated list of n non-negative integers (each ≤ 10^7). It then processes this list using the func_2 function, which returns three values: s, m, and ops. The function prints the values of s and m, followed by the pairs of values in ops, where each pair is incremented by 1. The function does not modify the input values n, a, s, or m, and its output consists of the printed values of s, m, and the incremented pairs from ops.
