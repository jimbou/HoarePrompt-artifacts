Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `s` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive), then `ops` is a list containing the tuple (`l`, `r`). Otherwise, `s` is greater than the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and its return value has been returned. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further action has been taken.***
