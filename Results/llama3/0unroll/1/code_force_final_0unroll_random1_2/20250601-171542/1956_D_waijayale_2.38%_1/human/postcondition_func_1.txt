This function calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list 'a' and returns the sum along with the length and contents of an empty list 'ops'. The function does not modify the input list 'a' and does not perform any operations that affect external state. The returned tuple contains the sum of the non-negative integers in 'a', the length of the empty list 'ops' (which is always 0), and the empty list 'ops' itself.
