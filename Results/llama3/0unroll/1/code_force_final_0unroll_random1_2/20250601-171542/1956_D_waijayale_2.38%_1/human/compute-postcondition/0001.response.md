Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 18, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than or equal to 10^7. We also know that `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the output values of `func_2(a)`, but we don't know what `func_2` does.

Since we don't have any information about what `func_2` does, we can't determine the exact values of `s` and `m`. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the precondition.

The `print(s, m)` statement will print the values of `s` and `m`, which are the output values of `func_2(a)`. Since `s` and `m` are the output values of a function that takes a list of non-negative integers as input, it's likely that `s` and `m` are also integers or some other type of value that can be printed.

Output: **s (the first output value of func_2(a)) and m (the second output value of func_2(a))**
