Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. 

func_1 is a recursive function that takes a list of non-negative integers a, two integers l and r, and a list of tuples ops as input. It modifies the list a by setting all elements within a specified range (l to r) to the length of that range (r - l + 1), if the first element of the range does not already match this value. It also keeps track of the operations performed by appending tuples representing the modified ranges to the list ops.

func_2 calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list a and returns the sum along with the length and contents of an empty list ops.

func_3 is a recursive function that takes a list of non-negative integers a and two integers l and r as input. It calculates the sum s of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive) and checks if s is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from l to r (inclusive). If true, it calls func_1(a, l, r, ops), appends the tuple (l, r) to ops, and sets all elements in a from index l to r to r - l + 1. If s is greater than the square of the number of elements in the subarray from l to r (inclusive), it finds the maximum value mx in the sublist a[l:r+1] and its index pos in the original list a. If pos is not equal to l, it recursively calls itself with arguments l and pos - 1. If pos is not equal to r, it recursively calls itself with arguments pos + 1 and r.

func_4 reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) followed by a space-separated list of n non-negative integers (each ≤ 10^7). It then processes this list using the func_2 function, which returns three values: s, m, and ops. The function prints the values of s and m, followed by the pairs of values in ops, where each pair is incremented by 1.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The functions work together to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the specified operation, and the program prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

Correctness: **True**
