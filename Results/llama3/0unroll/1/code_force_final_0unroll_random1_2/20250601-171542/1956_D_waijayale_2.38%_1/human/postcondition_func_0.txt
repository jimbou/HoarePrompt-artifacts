This function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` by setting all elements within a specified range (`l` to `r`) to the length of that range (`r - l + 1`), if the first element of the range does not already match this value. It also keeps track of the operations performed by appending tuples representing the modified ranges to a list `ops`. The function recursively processes the list, starting from the first element of the range and moving towards the end. If the range consists of a single element, it sets that element to 0 if it is not already 0, and appends the corresponding operation to `ops`.
