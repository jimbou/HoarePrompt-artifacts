Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array a by performing operations that set a range of elements to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set of elements in that range. However, the program does not correctly implement this operation.

Function func_1 is supposed to modify the list a by setting all elements within a specified range (l to r) to the length of that range (r - l + 1), if the first element of the range does not already match this value. However, it does not correctly implement this operation. It recursively processes the list, starting from the first element of the range and moving towards the end, but it does not correctly set the elements to the length of the range.

Function func_2 is supposed to calculate the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list a and return the sum along with the length and contents of an empty list ops. However, it does not correctly implement this operation. It does not modify the input list a and does not perform any operations that affect external state.

Function recursive_maximize_sum is supposed to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a by recursively calling itself with different ranges of the array. However, it does not correctly implement this operation. It calculates the sum s of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive) and checks if s is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from l to r (inclusive). If true, it calls func_1(a, l, r, ops), appends the tuple (l, r) to ops, and sets all elements in a from index l to r to r - l + 1. However, it does not correctly implement the operation of setting the elements to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set of elements in that range.

Function func_3 is supposed to read input from stdin, expecting a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) followed by a space-separated list of n non-negative integers (each ≤ 10^7). It then processes this list using the func_2 function, which returns three values: s, m, and ops. However, it does not correctly implement this operation. It prints the values of s and m, followed by the pairs of values in ops, where each pair is incremented by 1. However, it does not correctly implement the operation of maximizing the sum of the elements of the array a.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description.
