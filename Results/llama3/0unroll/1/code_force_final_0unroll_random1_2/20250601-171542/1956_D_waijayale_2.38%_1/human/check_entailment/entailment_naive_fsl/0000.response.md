Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly implement the operation of replacing a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray. However, the program does not correctly calculate the MEX and instead uses the length of the subarray as the replacement value.

For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The program will replace the entire array with the value 5, which is the length of the array. However, the correct MEX of the array is 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and the correctness is **False**.
