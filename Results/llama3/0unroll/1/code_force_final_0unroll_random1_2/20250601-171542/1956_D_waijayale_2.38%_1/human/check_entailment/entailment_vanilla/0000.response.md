Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `recursive_maximize_sum`, and `func_3`. 

`func_1` is a recursive function that takes an array `a`, two indices `l` and `r`, and a list of operations `ops` as input. It checks if `l` is equal to `r`. If they are equal, it checks if the element at index `l` is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` to 0. Then it returns. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it calls itself recursively with `l + 1` and `r` as the new `l` and `r`. Then it checks if the element at index `l` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If it is not equal, it appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`, and calls itself recursively with `l + 1` and `r` as the new `l` and `r`.

`func_2` takes an array `a` as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum sum of elements in `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations. It initializes an empty list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with 0 and `n - 1` as the initial `l` and `r`. Then it returns the sum of elements in `a`, the length of `ops`, and `ops`.

`recursive_maximize_sum` is a recursive function that takes two indices `l` and `r` as input. It calculates the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` and checks if the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If it is, it calls `func_1` with `a`, `l`, `r`, and `ops` as input, appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`. If the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it finds the maximum element in the range `[l, r]` and its position. If the position is not equal to `l`, it calls itself recursively with `l` and `pos - 1` as the new `l` and `r`. If the position is not equal to `r`, it calls itself recursively with `pos + 1` and `r` as the new `l` and `r`.

`func_3` reads the input, calls `func_2` with the input array, and prints the maximum sum and the list of operations.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the operation and the recursive approach to maximize the sum of elements in the array. It also correctly handles the base cases and the recursive calls.

Correctness: **True**
