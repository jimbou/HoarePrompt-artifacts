This function determines if a given string can be transformed into a sequence of k unique characters repeated n times by appending characters from a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If the string already meets this condition, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and returns the modified string by appending the first missing character from the set and filling the rest with 'a's to meet the required length.
