Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 26, m is a positive integer, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code reads the first line of a test case from stdin, assigning the values of n, k, and m to the corresponding variables. It then reads the second line of the test case, assigning the string s to the variable s. The variable us is created as a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The variables win and ans are initialized as empty sets and lists, respectively. The variable ps is initialized to 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
