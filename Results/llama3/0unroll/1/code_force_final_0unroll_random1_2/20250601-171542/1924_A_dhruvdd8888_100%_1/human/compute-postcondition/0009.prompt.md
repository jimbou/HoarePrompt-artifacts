You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m, where n, k, and m are positive integers and k <= 26. The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has iterated over the string s, and the set win contains the last k unique characters encountered in s. The list ans contains the kth unique character encountered in s, and the integer ps is the number of times k unique characters have been encountered in s. The set us remains unchanged, containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns and prints the string 'YES'
    #State: *The loop has iterated over the string s, and the set win contains the last k unique characters encountered in s. The list ans contains the kth unique character encountered in s, and the integer ps is the number of times k unique characters have been encountered in s. The set us remains unchanged, containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. ps is less than n.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop has iterated over the set us, and the set win contains the last k unique characters encountered in s. The list ans contains the kth unique character encountered in s, and the integer ps is the number of times k unique characters have been encountered in s. The set us remains unchanged, containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed. The loop has terminated and returned the string ''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1), where i is the first character in us that is not in win.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns and prints the string 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
