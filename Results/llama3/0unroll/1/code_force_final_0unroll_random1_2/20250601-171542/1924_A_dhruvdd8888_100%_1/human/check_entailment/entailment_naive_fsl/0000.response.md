Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains a character that is not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will not correctly identify the missing characters in the window and will not print the correct string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

For example, if the input is `n = 2, k = 2, m = 4, s = "abba"` and the program is modified to print the characters in the window, it will print `['a', 'b']` instead of `['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']`. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when a character is not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One possible solution is to add a check to ignore characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Here is an example of how the program can be modified to correctly handle characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets:
```
def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        else:
            continue
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```
This modified program correctly handles characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets by ignoring them and continuing to the next character in the string `s`.
