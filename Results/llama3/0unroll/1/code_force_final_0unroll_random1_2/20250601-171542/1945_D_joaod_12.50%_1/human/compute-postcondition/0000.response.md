Output State: **`cases` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines of input. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `cases` is now an integer, and the rest of the input remains the same, with multiple test cases, each containing three lines of input as described.
