Output State: **The output state will be the minimum cost to reach the final position from the initial position for each test case. The minimum cost is calculated by considering the minimum cost to reach each position from the initial position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The minimum cost to reach each position is calculated by considering the minimum cost to reach the previous position and the cost to move from the previous position to the current position. The cost to move from one position to another is the minimum of the cost to change the current position and the cost to pass through the current position. The output will be the minimum cost to reach the final position for each test case, which will be printed on a new line for each test case.**
