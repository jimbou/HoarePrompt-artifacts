Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program iterates through the queue from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position. It considers the minimum cost to reach each position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The cost to move from one position to another is the minimum of the cost to change the current position and the cost to pass through the current position.

The program also correctly handles the case where the final position is not at the end of the queue. It only considers the cost to reach positions that are before or at the final position.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of people in the queue, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
