This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines of input. It calculates the minimum cost to reach a final position from an initial position by considering the minimum cost to reach each position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The cost to move from one position to another is the minimum of the cost to change the current position and the cost to pass through the current position. The function prints the minimum cost to reach the final position for each test case on a new line.
