Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program iterates over the positions from the end to the beginning, maintaining a running total of the minimum cost to reach each position. It also keeps track of the minimum cost to reach the final position by considering the minimum cost to reach each position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The program correctly handles the case where the cost to change the current position is less than the cost to pass through the current position, and it correctly updates the total cost and the best cost to reach the final position accordingly. The program also correctly handles the case where the current position is beyond the final position, and it correctly updates the total cost and the best cost to reach the final position accordingly. The program correctly prints the minimum cost to reach the final position for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
