Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first m people in the queue. The program iterates over the positions from the end of the queue to the beginning, keeping track of the total cost and the best (minimum) cost found so far. It updates the total cost and the best cost based on the minimum cost to reach each position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The program handles the cases where the cost to change the current position is less than the cost to pass through the current position correctly. The program also handles the case where the final position is among the first m people in the queue correctly.

Correctness: **True**
