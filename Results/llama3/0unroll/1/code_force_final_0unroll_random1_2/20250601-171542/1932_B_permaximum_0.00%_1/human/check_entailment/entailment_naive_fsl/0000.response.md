Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the year when the sign will occur by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity to the current year. If the remainder is 0, it means the sign has already occurred in the current year, so it simply adds the periodicity to the current year.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the signs occur sequentially, as described in the problem statement. It also handles the case where the signs have different periodicities, and the case where the signs occur in the same year.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur, which is the year when the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **True**.
