Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the periodicity of the sign (or the periodicity itself if the remainder is 0) to the current year. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program also correctly handles the case where the periodicity of a sign is 1, in which case the sign will occur in the next year.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, consuming the contents of standard input and printing the correct results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
