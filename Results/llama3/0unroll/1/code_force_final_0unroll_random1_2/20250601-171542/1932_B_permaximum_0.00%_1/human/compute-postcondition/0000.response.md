Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each of which starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. The values of `n` and `a_i` are still within their respective ranges as specified in the initial state.
