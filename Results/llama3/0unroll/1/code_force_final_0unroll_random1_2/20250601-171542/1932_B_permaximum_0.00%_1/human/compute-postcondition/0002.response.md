Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the sum of the least common multiple of each test case's integers and prints the result for each test case on separate lines. The function consumes the contents of standard input and does not modify the value of the initial input t.**
