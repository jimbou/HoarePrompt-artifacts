a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the next t elements are lists of two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the remaining elements are lists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces rating of the cows.
