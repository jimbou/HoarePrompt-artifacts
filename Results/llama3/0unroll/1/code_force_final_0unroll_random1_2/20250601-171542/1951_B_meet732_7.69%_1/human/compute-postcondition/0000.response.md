Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the next t elements are lists of two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the remaining elements are lists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces rating of the cows, x is the kth element of the list a, ind is an empty list, c is 0**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `x` is assigned the value of the kth element of the list `a`, where k is the second element of the list `a` (since `a` contains lists of two integers `n` and `k`). The list `ind` is initialized as an empty list, and the variable `c` is set to 0.
