This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first element is an integer t, the next t elements are lists of two integers n and k, and the remaining elements are lists of n integers representing the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It finds the indices of the first two elements in the list that are greater than a given value x. If no such elements are found, it returns n-1. If only one such element is found, it returns k-1 if the index of that element is 0, otherwise it returns the index of that element minus 1. If two such elements are found, it returns the minimum of the second index minus 1 and k minus 1 if the first index is 0, otherwise it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and the difference between the second index and the first index if k is greater than the second index, or the maximum of the first index minus 1 and k minus the first index if k is less than or equal to the second index. Additionally, if k is equal to 14, it prints the list of indices.
