The input contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n) — the number of cows and your cow's index. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that a_i 's are pairwise different.
