Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by the cow at a given index k in a list of cows with different strength ratings. It considers two scenarios: swapping the strongest cow with the cow at index k, and swapping the cow at a specific position p with the cow at index k. The function then prints the maximum number of cows that can be defeated in each scenario for multiple test cases.**
