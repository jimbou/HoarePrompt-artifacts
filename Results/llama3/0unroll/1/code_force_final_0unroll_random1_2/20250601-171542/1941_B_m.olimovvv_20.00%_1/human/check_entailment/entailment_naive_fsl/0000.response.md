Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 1

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. The program only checks the first and last elements of the array, but it does not consider the middle elements. In this case, the middle elements (3, 5, 5) cannot be made equal to zero using the operations.

The program should check all elements of the array, not just the first and last ones. It should also consider the parity of the elements and the differences between consecutive elements. A correct solution would involve a more thorough analysis of the array and the possible operations.
