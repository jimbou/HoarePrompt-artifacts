Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by checking the parity of the first and last elements of the array and their relationship with the adjacent elements. The program correctly identifies that if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then it is impossible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operation.

The program also correctly handles the case where the first or last element is even, as in this case, it is always possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero by applying the operation repeatedly.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
