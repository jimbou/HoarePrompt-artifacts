#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple sets of inputs. Each set of input starts with a line containing two integers n and k (1 <= k < n <= 10^5), followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n).
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the number of sets of inputs in stdin. For each set of input, the function solve() will be called, which will process the input data and produce some output or side effects. The exact output state will depend on the implementation of the function solve(), which is not provided. However, in general, the output state will reflect the results of the processing done by the solve() function on each set of input data.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of input from stdin, where each set contains two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines of two integers v and u. It processes each set of input by calling the solve() function, which produces some output or side effects based on the input data. The function repeats this process for a number of times equal to the number of sets of inputs in stdin, with the final state reflecting the cumulative results of the processing done by the solve() function on all sets of input data.
