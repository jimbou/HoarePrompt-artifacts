Output State: **The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the number of sets of inputs in stdin. For each set of input, the function solve() will be called, which will process the input data and produce some output or side effects. The exact output state will depend on the implementation of the function solve(), which is not provided. However, in general, the output state will reflect the results of the processing done by the solve() function on each set of input data.**
