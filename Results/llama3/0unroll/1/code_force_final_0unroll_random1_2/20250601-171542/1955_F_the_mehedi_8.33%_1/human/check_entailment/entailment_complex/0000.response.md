Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case separately.
2.  For each test case, it checks if the first three numbers are equal and odd. If they are, it increments the count by 1. This is because if all three numbers are equal and odd, Bob can win by removing one of them, leaving Alice with an even number of each.
3.  Then, it calculates the integer division of each number by 2 and adds it to the count. This is because for each pair of numbers, Bob can win by removing one of them, leaving Alice with an even number of each.
4.  Finally, it prints the calculated count for each test case, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
