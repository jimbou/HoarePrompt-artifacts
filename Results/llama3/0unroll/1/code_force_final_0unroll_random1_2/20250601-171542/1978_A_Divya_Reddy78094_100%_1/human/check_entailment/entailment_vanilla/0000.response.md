Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books and adding it to the number of pages in the nth book.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem states that Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile. The given program does not consider the case where the maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books is not in the same pile as the nth book.

For example, consider the input [3, 1, 2]. The given program would output 3 + 2 = 5, but the correct output is 3 + 1 = 4, because Alice would read the book with 3 pages in one pile and the book with 1 page in the other pile.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
