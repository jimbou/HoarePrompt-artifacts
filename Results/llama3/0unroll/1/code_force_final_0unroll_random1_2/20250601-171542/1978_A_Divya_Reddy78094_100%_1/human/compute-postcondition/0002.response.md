Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer count of numbers followed by those numbers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum of all numbers in each test case except the last number and the last number itself. The function processes all test cases provided in the input and leaves the input stream empty after execution.**
