The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). So, the first integer `t` is removed from the stdin, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
