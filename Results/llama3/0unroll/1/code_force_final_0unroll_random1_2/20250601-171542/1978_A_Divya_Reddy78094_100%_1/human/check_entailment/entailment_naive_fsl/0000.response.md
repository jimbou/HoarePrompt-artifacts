Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum number of pages is not in the last book. For example, if the input is:

3
3 1 2

The program will output 4 (3 + 1), but the correct output should be 5 (3 + 2). The program assumes that the maximum number of pages is always in the last book, which is not necessarily true.

The program should sort the books in descending order and then sum the pages of the first two books to get the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.
