This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to their respective minimum values, considering the given conditions. The function handles cases where m is divisible by both a and b, as well as cases where it is not. The output is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required for the corresponding test case.
