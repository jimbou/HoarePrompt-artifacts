Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program attempts to solve this problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation and adding them together.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations (`a` and `b`) and the time the firework is visible in the sky (`m`).
3. It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it, storing the result in `mn`. This is the maximum number of minutes that a firework can be visible in the sky.
4. If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation by dividing `mn` by `a` and `b` and adding 1. This is because in this case, the fireworks from both installations will be visible for the same amount of time, and there will be one extra firework visible for one minute.
5. Otherwise, it simply calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation by dividing `mn` by `a` and `b`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
