Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when a or b is 1. In this case, the program will print mn // a + mn // b, but it should print mn // a + mn // b + 1. This is because when a or b is 1, the first firework will be visible for m + 1 minutes, and the second firework will be visible for m + 1 minutes as well, so the total number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is mn // a + mn // b + 1.

For example, when a = 1, b = 1, and m = 1, the program will print 2, but the correct answer is 4.
