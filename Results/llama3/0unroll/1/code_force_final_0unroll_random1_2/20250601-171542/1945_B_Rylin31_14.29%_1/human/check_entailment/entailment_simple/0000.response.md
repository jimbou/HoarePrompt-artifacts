Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
2.  It calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible in the sky at the same time.
3.  The program then checks if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, and if `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means that the first firework launched from each installation will be visible for one minute, and the subsequent fireworks will be visible for `m + 1` minutes. In this case, the program adds 1 to the total count of visible fireworks.
4.  If the condition is not true, the program simply calculates the total count of visible fireworks as the sum of the number of fireworks launched from each installation that are visible in the sky at the same time.
5.  The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
