The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 10^4.

After executing the code, the value of `t` will be assigned the integer value read from the standard input. The remaining input in the standard input will be `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
