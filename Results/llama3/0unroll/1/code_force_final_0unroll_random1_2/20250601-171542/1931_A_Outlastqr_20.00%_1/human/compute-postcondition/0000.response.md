Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers (3 <= n <= 78).**

In this output state, `alphabet` is assigned the string of all lowercase English letters using `string.ascii_lowercase`. The values of the other variables are not affected, and the stdin still contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers (3 <= n <= 78).
