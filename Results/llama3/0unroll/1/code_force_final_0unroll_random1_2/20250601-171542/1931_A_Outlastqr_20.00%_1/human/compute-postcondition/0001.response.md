Output State: **The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the first input integer. Each iteration will print a string of three characters. The first character will be the nth letter of the alphabet, where n is the current iteration number. The second character will be 'a' if the iteration number is less than or equal to 26, 'z' if the iteration number is greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, and the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet if the iteration number is greater than 52. The third character will be 'z' if the iteration number is less than or equal to 26, the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet if the iteration number is greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, and 'z' if the iteration number is greater than 52. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.**
