You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers (3 <= n <= 78).
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the first input integer. Each iteration will print a string of three characters. The first character will be the nth letter of the alphabet, where n is the current iteration number. The second character will be 'a' if the iteration number is less than or equal to 26, 'z' if the iteration number is greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, and the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet if the iteration number is greater than 52. The third character will be 'z' if the iteration number is less than or equal to 26, the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet if the iteration number is greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, and 'z' if the iteration number is greater than 52. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
