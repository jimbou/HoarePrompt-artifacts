Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if the input integer `n` is greater than 52. If it is, it means that the first letter of the word must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would result in a sum of 1 + 26 + 26 = 53), so it adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet to the word and appends 'zz' to get the lexicographically smallest word.

2. If `n` is not greater than 52, the program checks if it is greater than 26. If it is, it means that the second letter of the word must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would result in a sum of 1 + 1 + 26 = 28), so it adds 'a' to the word, adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet, and appends 'z' to get the lexicographically smallest word.

3. If `n` is not greater than 26, it means that the third letter of the word must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would result in a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3), so it adds 'aa' to the word and adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet to get the lexicographically smallest word.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer.
