#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sides of a triangle.
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True if the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and False otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether three given positive integers can form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, returning True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na+nb+nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.

    #State: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na+nb+nc = n, numbers is an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists of positive integers, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are positive integers.

        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES' and three lists of positive integers, group_a, group_b, and group_c, and the current value of the result of the function func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) is True.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers na, nb, and nc as input, where na+nb+nc equals the total number of integers. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) based on a distribution logic implemented in the distribute_number function. If the sums of the numbers in each group (sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) satisfy a certain condition checked by the func_1 function, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups of numbers. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
