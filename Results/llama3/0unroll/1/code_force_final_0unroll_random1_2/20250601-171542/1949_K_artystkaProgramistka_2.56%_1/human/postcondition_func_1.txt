This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers na, nb, and nc as input, where na+nb+nc equals the total number of integers. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) based on a distribution logic implemented in the distribute_number function. If the sums of the numbers in each group (sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) satisfy a certain condition checked by the func_1 function, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups of numbers. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
