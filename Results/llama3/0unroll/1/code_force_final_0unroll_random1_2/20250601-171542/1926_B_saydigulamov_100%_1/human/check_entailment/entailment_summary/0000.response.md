Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the shape formed by '1's in the grid. The program checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal, and if so, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. However, this logic is not sufficient to correctly identify the shape.

For example, consider the following grid:

0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
1111111110
0111111100
0011111000
0001110000
0000100000

This grid forms a triangle, but the program will incorrectly print 'SQUARE' because the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal.

A correct solution would need to check the pattern of '1's in the entire grid, not just the first two rows.

Correctness: **False**
