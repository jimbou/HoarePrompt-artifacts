Output State: **The loop will execute 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100. In each iteration, it will read a test case from stdin, determine whether the shape formed by '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle, and print the result. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The value of 'a' will remain unchanged.**
