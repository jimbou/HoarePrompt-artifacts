Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

The program will output "TRIANGLE", but the correct output is "SQUARE". This is because the program does not check the position of the '1's in the grid, only their count. 

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check the position of the '1's in the grid, not just their count.
