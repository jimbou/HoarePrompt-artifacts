Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `a` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.
3.  It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores them in the list `k`.
4.  It checks if the number of '1's in the first row is equal to the number of '1's in the second row. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

This logic is correct because:

*   A square will always have the same number of '1's in each row, whereas a triangle will have a different number of '1's in each row.
*   The program only needs to check the first two rows to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle, because the size of the triangle or square is guaranteed to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the shape formed by '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
