Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `a` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing a string of `n` characters '0' or '1'.
3. It then checks if the first two rows of the grid have the same number of '1's. If they do, it prints "SQUARE". Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
4. The program's logic is based on the fact that a square will always have the same number of '1's in the first two rows, while a triangle will not.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It reads the input correctly, processes it correctly, and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
