Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains a test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing a string of n characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `a` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 100. The remaining input in the stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (between 2 and 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid formed by these characters contains exactly one triangle or one square that encompasses all the '1's, and the size of this triangle or square is greater than 1.
