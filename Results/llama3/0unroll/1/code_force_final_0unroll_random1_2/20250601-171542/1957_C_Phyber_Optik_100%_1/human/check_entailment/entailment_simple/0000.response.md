Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the chessboard game.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `300007` with all elements set to `-1`. It then calls the function `func_1(300000)`, which is not shown in the code snippet, but presumably populates the `dp` array with values from `dp[1]` to `dp[300000]`.

The `dp` array is used to store the number of possible final configurations for a chessboard of size `i x i`, where `i` ranges from `1` to `300000`. The values in the `dp` array are calculated using the recurrence relation:

`dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`

This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for a chessboard of size `i x i`, there are two types of moves:

1. Placing a white rook on the diagonal (i.e., `r = c`). In this case, the computer cannot mirror the move, and the number of possible final configurations is the same as for a chessboard of size `(i - 1) x (i - 1)`, which is `dp[i - 1]`.
2. Placing a white rook on a non-diagonal position (i.e., `r != c`). In this case, the computer can mirror the move, and the number of possible final configurations is twice the number of possible final configurations for a chessboard of size `(i - 2) x (i - 2)`, which is `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`.

The program then reads the input for each test case, which consists of the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`. It then reads the coordinates of the `k` moves and stores them in a set `invalid`.

Finally, the program prints the maximum of `1` and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of possible final configurations for the remaining empty cells on the chessboard.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations using the recurrence relation and the DP array, and it handles the base cases correctly (i.e., `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).

Correctness: **True**
