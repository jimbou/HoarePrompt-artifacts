Output State: **n is a positive integer, dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3**

The code snippet assigns specific values to `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, setting them to 1 and 3, respectively. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer, but the code does not modify or use the value of `n` in any way. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged.
