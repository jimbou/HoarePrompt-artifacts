#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: dp array will be populated with values from dp[3] to dp[n], where each value dp[i] is calculated using the formula provided in the loop, starting with dp[1]=1 and dp[2]=3, and all calculations are performed modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and populates an array `dp` with values from index 3 to `n`, where each value `dp[i]` is computed using a recursive formula involving previous values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, with all calculations performed modulo 1000000007, starting with initial values `dp[1]=1` and `dp[2]=3`.
