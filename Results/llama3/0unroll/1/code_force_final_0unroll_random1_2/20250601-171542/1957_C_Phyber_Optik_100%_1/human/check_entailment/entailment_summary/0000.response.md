Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard from 1 to n, and then uses this information to calculate the number of possible configurations for the given size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move, and it correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for each case. The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining, in which case the number of possible configurations is 1.

The program uses a recursive formula to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard, which is efficient and accurate. The program also uses a modulo operation to prevent overflow, which is necessary because the number of possible configurations can be very large.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
