Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each value of n.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes a list `dp` of size 300007 with all elements set to -1. This list will be used to store the number of possible configurations for each value of n.

2. The function `func_1(n)` is called with the argument 300000. This function calculates the number of possible configurations for each value of n from 1 to 300000 and stores the results in the `dp` list.

3. The function `func_1(n)` uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are correct because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board and three ways to place a rook on a 2x2 board.

4. For `i` ranging from 3 to `n`, the function calculates `dp[i]` as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula is correct because it takes into account the number of ways to place a rook on the current row and the number of ways to place a rook on the previous row.

5. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

6. The program then reads the `k` moves and stores the rows and columns of the moves in a set `invalid`. This set is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

7. Finally, the program prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]` as the number of possible final configurations. This is correct because `n - len(invalid)` represents the number of empty rows and columns on the board, and `dp[n - len(invalid)]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on those empty rows and columns.

Correctness: **True**
