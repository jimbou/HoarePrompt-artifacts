Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a solution to the problem of counting the number of different final configurations in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for a given board size and number of moves already played.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with a size of 300007, which is sufficient to handle the maximum board size of 3 * 10^5. The `func_1` function is used to calculate the values of `dp` for board sizes from 1 to 300000.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the number of moves already played. For each test case, it reads the moves already played and calculates the number of invalid positions on the board (i.e., positions that are already occupied by a rook).

The program then prints the maximum of 1 and the value of `dp` for the remaining valid positions on the board. This is because if there are no valid positions left, there is only one possible configuration (i.e., no more moves can be made).

The program uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 10^9 + 7.

After analyzing the program, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the base cases, and the dynamic programming approach is correct. The use of the modulo operator ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
