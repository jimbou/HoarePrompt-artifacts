Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for a given board size n, and then uses this precomputed value to calculate the number of possible configurations for the given test case.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for a given board size n. The recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming approach is also correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for a given board size n by considering the number of possible configurations for the previous board sizes (n-1 and n-2) and combining them in the correct way.

The program also correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when r = c). In this case, the program simply skips the computer's turn and continues with the next move.

The program also correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the given test case by subtracting the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would result in two rooks attacking each other) from the total number of possible configurations for the given board size n.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
