Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin is empty, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is an integer such that 0.5 * n^2 <= max_k <= 2 * 10^10. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`***
