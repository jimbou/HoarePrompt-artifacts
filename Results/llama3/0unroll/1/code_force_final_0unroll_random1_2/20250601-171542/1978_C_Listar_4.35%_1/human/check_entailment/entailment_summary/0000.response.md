Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. `func_2()` correctly determines whether a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k` exists for a length `n`. It checks if `k` is odd, calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n`, and returns `(0, 0)` if `k` exceeds this maximum value. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. `func_1()` correctly generates a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k` for a length `n`. It rotates the list of integers from 1 to `n` to the right by `k` places, which is equivalent to finding a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.

3. `func_3()` correctly prints the permutation generated by `func_1()` in the required format.

4. `func_4()` correctly orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_2()` to determine if a permutation exists, and if so, calls `func_1()` to generate the permutation and `func_3()` to print it. If no permutation exists, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, and the functions work together to produce the desired output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
