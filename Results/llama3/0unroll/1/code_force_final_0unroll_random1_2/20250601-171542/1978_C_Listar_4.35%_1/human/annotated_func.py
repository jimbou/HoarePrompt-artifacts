    #State: Output State: The list l is rotated to the right by k places, where k is the number of times the loop executes the rotation operation. The value of n remains unchanged, and k is reduced to 0 after the loop finishes executing.

#Overall this is what the function does:Rotates a list of integers from 1 to n to the right by k places, where k is the number of times the rotation operation is performed, and returns the rotated list. The function takes two parameters, n and k, and modifies the list in-place. The value of n remains unchanged, and k is reduced to 0 after the rotation operation is complete.

    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, stdin is empty, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is an integer such that 0.5 * n^2 <= max_k <= 2 * 10^10. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`

    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `k` is between 0.5 * n^2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either a tuple containing the original values of `n` and `k` or a tuple containing two zeros. The function first checks if `k` is odd, in which case it immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The returned values of `n` and `k` are constrained by the conditions that `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive), and if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `k` is between 0.5 * n^2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).

    print()
    #This is printed: YES, followed by all elements of the list l, separated by spaces
    return
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:Prints 'YES' followed by all elements of the input list, separated by spaces, and returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer and k is a non-negative integer. The value of n and k are obtained from the function func_2().
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current value of 'n' is 0 and 'NO' is being printed.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are non-negative integers, and their values are returned by the function `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement or value specified in the given code snippet.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a condition is met based on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without any output. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` with `n` and `k` as arguments, assigns the result to `l`, and then calls `func_3()` with `l` as an argument, without returning any value.
