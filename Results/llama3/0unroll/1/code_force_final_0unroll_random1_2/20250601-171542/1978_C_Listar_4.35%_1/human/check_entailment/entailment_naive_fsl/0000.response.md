Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 5 and k = 12, the program outputs "Yes" and the permutation [5, 4, 3, 1, 2], but the Manhattan value of this permutation is 6, not 12. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given n, and it does not correctly construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value.

In the function func_2, the calculation of max_k is incorrect. The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length n is actually n*(n-1)/2, not (n**2 - 1) // 2 or n**2 // 2. This means that the program will incorrectly determine that a permutation with a certain Manhattan value is not possible when it actually is.

Additionally, the function func_1 does not correctly construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value. It tries to construct the permutation by swapping elements from the end of the list to the beginning, but this approach does not always result in a permutation with the correct Manhattan value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
