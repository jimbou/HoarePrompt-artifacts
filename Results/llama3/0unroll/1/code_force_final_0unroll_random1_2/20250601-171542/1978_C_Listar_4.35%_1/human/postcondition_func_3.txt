This function determines whether a condition is met based on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without any output. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` with `n` and `k` as arguments, assigns the result to `l`, and then calls `func_3()` with `l` as an argument, without returning any value.
