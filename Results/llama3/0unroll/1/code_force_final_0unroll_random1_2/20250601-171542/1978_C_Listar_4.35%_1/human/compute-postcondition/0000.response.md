Output State: **`n` and `k` are non-negative integers, and their values are returned by the function `func_2()`**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the return values of the function `func_2()`. Since `func_2()` returns non-negative integers, `n` and `k` are now non-negative integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the return values of `func_2()`.
