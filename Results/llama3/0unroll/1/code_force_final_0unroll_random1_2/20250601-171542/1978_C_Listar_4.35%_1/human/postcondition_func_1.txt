This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either a tuple containing the original values of `n` and `k` or a tuple containing two zeros. The function first checks if `k` is odd, in which case it immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The returned values of `n` and `k` are constrained by the conditions that `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive), and if `n` is odd, `k` is less than or equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `k` is between 0.5 * n^2 and 2 * 10^10 (inclusive).
