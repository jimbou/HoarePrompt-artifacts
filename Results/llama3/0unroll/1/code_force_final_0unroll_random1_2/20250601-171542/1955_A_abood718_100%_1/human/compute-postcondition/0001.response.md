Output State: **The output state will be a list of t integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding set of inputs. The calculation is based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If B is less than half of C, the result is A times B. If A is even, the result is A times C divided by 2. Otherwise, the result is X times C plus B, where X is A divided by 2.**
