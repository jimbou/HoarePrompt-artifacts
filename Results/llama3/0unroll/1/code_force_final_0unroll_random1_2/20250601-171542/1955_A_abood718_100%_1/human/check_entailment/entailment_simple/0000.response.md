Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program iterates over the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions specified.

The program first checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C). If this condition is true, it means that buying yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so the program prints the total cost as A times B.

If the first condition is not true, the program checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If A is even, it means that Maxim can buy all yogurts at the promotion price, so the program prints the total cost as A times C divided by 2.

If A is not even, it means that Maxim needs to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest at the promotion price. The program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts (X) by dividing A by 2, and then prints the total cost as X times C plus B.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
