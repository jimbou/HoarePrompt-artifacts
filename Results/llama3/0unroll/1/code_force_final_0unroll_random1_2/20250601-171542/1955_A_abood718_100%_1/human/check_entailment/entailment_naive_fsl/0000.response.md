Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (C). If it is, it simply multiplies the number of yogurts (A) by the regular price (B) to get the total cost.

If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, it checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, it divides the number of yogurts by 2 and multiplies the result by the promotion price (C) to get the total cost.

If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts (X = A // 2) and multiplies this by the promotion price (C). It then adds the regular price (B) to account for the remaining yogurt.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, when the number of yogurts is even, and when the number of yogurts is odd. Therefore, the program is correct.
