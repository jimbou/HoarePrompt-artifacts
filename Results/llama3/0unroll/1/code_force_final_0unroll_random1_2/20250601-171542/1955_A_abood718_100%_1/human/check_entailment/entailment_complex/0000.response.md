Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the price of one yogurt (B) is less than half the price of two yogurts on promotion (C), it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. In this case, the total cost is A * B.

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it's cheaper to buy them in pairs at the promotion price. In this case, the total cost is A * C / 2.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the individual price. In this case, the total cost is X * C + B, where X is A / 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
