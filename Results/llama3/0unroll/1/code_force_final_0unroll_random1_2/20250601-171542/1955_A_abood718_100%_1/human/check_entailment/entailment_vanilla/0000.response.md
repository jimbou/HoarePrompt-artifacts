Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).
3. The program then checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is less than the promotion price (b). If this condition is true, it means that buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price.
4. If the condition in step 3 is true, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts (n) by the price of one yogurt (a). This is because buying each yogurt individually at the regular price is the cheapest option.
5. If the condition in step 3 is false, the program checks if the number of yogurts (n) is even. If n is even, it means that Maxim can buy all the yogurts in pairs, taking advantage of the promotion price.
6. If n is even, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs (n/2) by the promotion price (b). This is because buying all the yogurts in pairs at the promotion price is the cheapest option.
7. If n is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs (n//2) and the remaining yogurt (n % 2). It then calculates the total cost by adding the cost of the pairs (X * C) and the cost of the remaining yogurt (B).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
