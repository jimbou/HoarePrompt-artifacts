To determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand the logic within the loop and how it processes the input values.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the first integer input. For each iteration, it takes three integers as input: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Based on these inputs, it performs different calculations and prints the results.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does:

1. **Input `t`**: The loop will execute `t` times.
2. **Input `n`, `a`, `b`**: For each iteration, these three integers are input.
3. **Condition 1: `B * 2 < C`**: If this condition is true, it prints `A * B`.
4. **Condition 2: `A % 2 == 0`**: If the first condition is false and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
5. **Else**: If neither of the above conditions is true, it calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

Given the initial state is `stdin` containing `t+1` inputs, the output state will be the results of these calculations for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` inputs, printed to the console.

To adhere to the requested format and provide a clear, human-understandable description of the output state:

**Output State:** The output will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of the calculations based on the conditions checked within the loop for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` inputs.
