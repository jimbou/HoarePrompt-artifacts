Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program first checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the promotion price (C). If this condition is true, it calculates the minimum cost by multiplying the number of yogurts (A) by the regular price (B).

If the first condition is not met, the program checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If A is even, it calculates the minimum cost by multiplying A by the promotion price (C) and dividing the result by 2.

If A is odd, the program calculates the minimum cost by first finding the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (X = A // 2), then multiplying X by the promotion price (C), and finally adding the price of the remaining yogurt (B).

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and calculates the minimum cost accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
