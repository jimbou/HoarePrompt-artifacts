Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns, following certain rules based on the direction of arrows in each cell. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the directions of the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively. It checks whether the robot can move from the starting position (1,1) to the target position (2,n) based on the given conditions. The function iterates over the columns, checking for certain patterns of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target position. If it finds such a pattern, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

`func_2` reads input for a specified number of test cases, processes each case by calling `func_1` with the input values, and prints the results.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the rules of the problem, and `func_2` properly reads input and prints the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
