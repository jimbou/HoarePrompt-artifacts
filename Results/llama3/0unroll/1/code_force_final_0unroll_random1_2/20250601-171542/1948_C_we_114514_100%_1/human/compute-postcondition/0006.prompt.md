You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive even integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
        
    #State: The loop completes all iterations without returning 'No', indicating that the conditions within the loop are not met for any iteration. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with n still being a positive even integer, row1 and row2 being strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and half_n being an integer equal to half of n.
    if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<') :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: *The loop completes all iterations without returning 'No', indicating that the conditions within the loop are not met for any iteration. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with n still being a positive even integer, row1 and row2 being strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and half_n being an integer equal to half of n. Additionally, it is not the case that the last character of row1 is '<' and the second last character of row2 is '<'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes', indicating that the conditions within the loop were not met for any iteration, and the state of the variables remains unchanged, with n still being a positive even integer, row1 and row2 being strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and half_n being an integer equal to half of n.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'Yes', indicating that the conditions within the loop were not met for any iteration, and the state of the variables remains unchanged, with n still being a positive even integer, row1 and row2 being strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and half_n being an integer equal to half of n.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
