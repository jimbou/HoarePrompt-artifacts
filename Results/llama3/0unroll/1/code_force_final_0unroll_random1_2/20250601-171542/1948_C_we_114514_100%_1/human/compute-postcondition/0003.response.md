Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `t` is a positive integer equal to 0. This means that `t` is actually 0, not a positive integer.
* `n` is an even positive integer. This means that `n` is a positive integer that is divisible by 2.
* `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. This means that `row1` and `row2` are strings of the same length `n`, and each character in these strings is either '<' or '>'.
* `results` is a list of `t` items, each item is the output of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`. Since `t` is 0, the list `results` is empty.
* `stdin` contains 0 inputs. This is not relevant to the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('\n'.join(results))`

Since `results` is an empty list, the `join` method will return an empty string. Therefore, the print statement will print an empty string.

Output: **(empty string)**
