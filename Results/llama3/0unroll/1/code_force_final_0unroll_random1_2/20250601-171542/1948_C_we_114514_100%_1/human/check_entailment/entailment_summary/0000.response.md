Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid based on certain rules. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` determines whether the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given conditions of two rows of '<' and '>' characters. It returns 'Yes' if the movement is possible and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads input for a specified number of test cases, processes each case by calling `func_1` with the input values, and prints the results.

The program's logic is correct. `func_1` checks the conditions for the robot's movement and returns the appropriate result. `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, then prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
