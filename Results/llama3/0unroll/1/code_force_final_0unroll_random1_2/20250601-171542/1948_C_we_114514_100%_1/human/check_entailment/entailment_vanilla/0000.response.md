Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting position (1, 1) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell. The input consists of the number of test cases, the number of columns, and the two rows of the grid, each represented as a string of '<' and '>' characters.

The provided program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes the number of columns, the first row, and the second row as input and returns 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). func_2 reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze func_1:

1.  The function calculates half_n as n // 2, which is used to iterate over the first half of the grid.
2.  It then iterates over the first half of the grid, checking if the current cell in the first row is '<' and if the corresponding cells in the second row are '<'. If this condition is met, it returns 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
3.  After the loop, it checks if the last cell in the first row is '<' and the second last cell in the second row is '<'. If this condition is met, it returns 'No'.
4.  If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The logic behind func_1 seems to be correct. It checks for the conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n) and returns 'No' if any of those conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that the robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell. The program does not explicitly simulate these movements. Instead, it relies on the conditions checked in func_1 to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

To confirm the correctness of the program, let's analyze the conditions checked in func_1:

*   The first condition checks if the current cell in the first row is '<' and if the corresponding cells in the second row are '<'. This condition is necessary because if the robot moves down from the current cell, it will follow the '<' arrow in the second row, which would prevent it from reaching the cell (2, n).
*   The second condition checks if the last cell in the first row is '<' and the second last cell in the second row is '<'. This condition is necessary because if the robot moves down from the last cell in the first row, it will follow the '<' arrow in the second row, which would prevent it from reaching the cell (2, n).

Based on this analysis, the conditions checked in func_1 seem to be sufficient to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). However, the program does not explicitly simulate the movements of the robot, which might make it difficult to understand the logic behind the conditions.

In conclusion, the program seems to be correct, but the logic behind it might be difficult to understand due to the lack of explicit simulation of the robot's movements.

Correctness: **True**
