Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the process of laying down cards as described in the problem description. It first calculates the number of cards that are laid down in each round, and then calculates the k-th card based on the number of rounds and the position of the card in the current round.

The program handles the case where k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, which means the k-th card is not in the first round. In this case, it calculates the number of cards laid down in each round until it reaches the round where the k-th card is laid down. Then it calculates the k-th card based on the position of the card in the current round.

The program also handles the case where k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, which means the k-th card is in the first round. In this case, it simply prints 2 * k - 1, which is the correct result.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
