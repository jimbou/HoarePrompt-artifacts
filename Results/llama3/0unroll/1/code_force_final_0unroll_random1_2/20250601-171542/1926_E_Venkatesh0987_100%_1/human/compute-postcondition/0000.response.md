Output State: **The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair (n, k). The number of integers in the output state will be equal to the value of t, which is the number of input pairs. Each integer will be the result of the calculation 2 * k - 1 if k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, or 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1) if k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, where i is the number of iterations of the while loop and f is the value of k - g.**
