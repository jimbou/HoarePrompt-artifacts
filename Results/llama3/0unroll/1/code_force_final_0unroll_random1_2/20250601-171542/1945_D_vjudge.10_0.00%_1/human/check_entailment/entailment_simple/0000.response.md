Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads the input data, processes it according to the problem's requirements, and prints the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to not wait too long.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, and the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person.
2.  It initializes variables to store the total cost for each test case and iterates over the test cases.
3.  For each test case, it calculates the total cost by iterating over the people in the queue from the end to the maximum allowable final position. It chooses the minimum cost between `a_i` and `b_i` for each person and adds it to the total cost.
4.  After reaching the maximum allowable final position, it checks if it's more cost-effective to move to the previous position by comparing `a_i + b_{i+1}` with `a_{i+1}`. If it is, it adds `b_{i+1}` to the total cost and moves to the previous position. Otherwise, it adds `a_{i+1}` to the total cost and stops.
5.  Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input data.

Correctness: **True**
