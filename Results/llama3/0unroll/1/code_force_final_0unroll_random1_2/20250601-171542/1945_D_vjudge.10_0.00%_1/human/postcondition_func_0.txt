The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two lines of n space-separated integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). It calculates the total cost for each test case by iterating through the integers from n to m, adding the smaller of a_i and b_i to the cost, and then iterating from m to 1, adding the smaller of a_(i-1) + b_i and a_i to the cost. The function prints the total cost for each test case to the console, leaving the input stream empty and the output list (custos) empty after execution.
