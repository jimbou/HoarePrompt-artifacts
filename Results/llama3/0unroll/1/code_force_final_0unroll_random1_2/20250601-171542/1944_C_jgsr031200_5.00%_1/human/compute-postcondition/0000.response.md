Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set**

The code snippet consists of three lines, each with a distinct effect on the program state.

The first line, `nums = Counter(arr)`, creates a dictionary `nums` where the keys are the unique elements from the list `arr`, and the values are their respective counts. This line does not modify the original list `arr`.

The second line, `start = 0`, assigns the value 0 to the variable `start`. This line does not affect any other variables.

The third line, `vis = set()`, creates an empty set `vis`. This line does not affect any other variables.

After executing the entire code block, the final state includes the original list `arr` of non-negative integers, the newly created dictionary `nums` with element counts, the variable `start` with value 0, and the empty set `vis`.
