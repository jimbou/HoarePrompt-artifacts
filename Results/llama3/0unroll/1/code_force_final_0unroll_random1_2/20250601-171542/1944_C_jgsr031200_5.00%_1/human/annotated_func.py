#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: nums is updated with decremented counts for elements in arr, start is the index of the last element in arr that had a count greater than 0, vis contains all elements from arr that had a count greater than 0
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the index of the last element in arr that had a count greater than 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the index of the last element in the list that had a count greater than 0. It also updates the counts of elements in the list by decrementing them based on certain conditions. If an element at index `start + 1` has a count greater than 0, it decrements the count and moves to the next index. If not, it prints the current index `start + 1` and returns. The function also keeps track of all elements from the input list that had a count greater than 0 in a set called `vis`.
