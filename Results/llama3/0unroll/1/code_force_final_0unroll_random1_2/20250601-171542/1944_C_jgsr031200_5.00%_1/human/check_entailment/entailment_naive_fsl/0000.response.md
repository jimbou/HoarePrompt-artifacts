Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the final score of the game by simulating the optimal strategy for both players.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first counts the frequency of each number in the input array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
2. It then initializes a variable `start` to 0, which represents the current number being considered.
3. The program enters a loop that continues until it finds a number that is not present in the input array or has a frequency of 0.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `start` is present in the input array. If it is, it decrements the frequency of `start` by 1.
5. If the frequency of `start` becomes 0, it checks if the next number `start + 1` is present in the input array. If it is, it decrements the frequency of `start + 1` by 1 and increments `start` by 1.
6. If the frequency of `start + 1` is 0, it prints the value of `start + 1` as the final score and returns.
7. If the loop completes without finding a number that is not present in the input array or has a frequency of 0, it prints the value of `start` as the final score.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players, which is to alternate between choosing the smallest available number and the next smallest available number. This strategy ensures that the final score is the smallest possible number that is not present in the input array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
