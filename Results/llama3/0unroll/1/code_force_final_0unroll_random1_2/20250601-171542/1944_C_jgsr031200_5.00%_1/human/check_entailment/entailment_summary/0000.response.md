Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score in the game. The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the input list. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to the maximum number in the list, decrementing the count of the current number and the next number if it exists. If the count of the next number is 0, it prints the current index + 1, which is the MEX of the list.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate numbers, and it also correctly handles the case where the input list contains numbers that are not consecutive.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it iterates through the list once to count the occurrences of each number, and then it iterates through the numbers from 0 to the maximum number in the list, which is at most n.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), because it uses a Counter to store the counts of each number in the list, which can contain up to n elements.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
