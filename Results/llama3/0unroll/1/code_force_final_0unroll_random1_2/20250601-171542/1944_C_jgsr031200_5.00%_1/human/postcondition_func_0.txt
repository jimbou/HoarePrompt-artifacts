The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the index of the last element in the list that had a count greater than 0. It also updates the counts of elements in the list by decrementing them based on certain conditions. If an element at index `start + 1` has a count greater than 0, it decrements the count and moves to the next index. If not, it prints the current index `start + 1` and returns. The function also keeps track of all elements from the input list that had a count greater than 0 in a set called `vis`.
