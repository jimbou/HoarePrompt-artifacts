Output State: **nums is updated with decremented counts for elements in arr, start is the index of the last element in arr that had a count greater than 0, vis contains all elements from arr that had a count greater than 0**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `nums` has been updated to reflect the decremented counts of elements in the list `arr`. The variable `start` now holds the index of the last element in `arr` that had a count greater than 0. The set `vis` contains all elements from `arr` that had a count greater than 0.
