Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR prefix sum. The program calculates the XOR prefix sum of the array and stores the indices of each prefix sum in a dictionary. Then, for each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the given range that has a XOR sum equal to a given value. The program correctly handles the case where the XOR sum of the subarray is zero and also handles the case where the XOR sum is non-zero. The program uses binary search to find the indices of the prefix sum in the dictionary, which makes the program efficient.

Correctness: **True**
