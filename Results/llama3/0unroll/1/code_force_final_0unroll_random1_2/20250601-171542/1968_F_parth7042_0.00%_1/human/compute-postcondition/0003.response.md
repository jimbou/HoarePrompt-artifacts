The code prints the results of each test case, one result per line, where each result is a string stored in the `results` list.

Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of each test case, separated by newline characters.

Output: **results of each test case, one result per line (where results are the strings stored in the results list)**
