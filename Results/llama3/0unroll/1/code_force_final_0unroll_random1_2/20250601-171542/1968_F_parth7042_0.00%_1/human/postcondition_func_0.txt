This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. The function processes each test case by calculating the XOR prefix sum of the list of integers and storing the indices of each prefix sum in a dictionary. It then answers q queries by checking if there exists a subarray within the given range that has a XOR sum equal to a given value. The function prints the results of each test case, one result per line, with 'YES' indicating the existence of such a subarray and 'NO' otherwise.
