Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR prefix sum. The program calculates the XOR prefix sum of the array and stores the indices of each prefix sum in a dictionary. Then, for each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the given range that has a XOR sum equal to a given value. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the indices of the prefix sum in the dictionary, which reduces the time complexity of the program. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the XOR sum of the subarray is 0.

Correctness: **True**
