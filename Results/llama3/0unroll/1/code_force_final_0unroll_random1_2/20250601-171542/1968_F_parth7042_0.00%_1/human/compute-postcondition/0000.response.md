Output State: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers. t is an integer, idx is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings containing the first input line split into substrings.**

Explanation:
The first line reads the entire input line into the variable `data` as a list of strings, split by spaces. This means that `data` now contains the first line of input, which includes the integer `t`, and `stdin` now contains `t` test cases. The second line initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The third line converts the first element of `data` (at index 0) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The fourth line increments `idx` by 1, making it 1. The fifth line initializes an empty list called `results`. 

Note that the values of `n`, `q`, and the list of integers, as well as the pairs of integers, are not affected by this code snippet, as they are part of the input that has not been processed yet.
