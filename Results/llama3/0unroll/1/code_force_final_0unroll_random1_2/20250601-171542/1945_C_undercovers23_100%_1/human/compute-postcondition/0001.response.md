Output State: **The loop will have printed the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string s are both greater than or equal to 50%, for each of the t test cases. If no such index exists, it will have printed 0 if the percentage of ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%, and n otherwise. The values of t, n, s, pk, sl, o, z, zero, one, lst, mini, and final will have been updated for each test case, but their final values will be the ones from the last test case.**
