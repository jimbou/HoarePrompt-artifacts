Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 2*10^4). Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5), and the second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
