The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 2*10^4). This integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one line. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line.
Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line.**
