Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string are both greater than or equal to 50%. If such an index exists, it prints the smallest one; otherwise, it prints 0 if the percentage of ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%, and n otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
