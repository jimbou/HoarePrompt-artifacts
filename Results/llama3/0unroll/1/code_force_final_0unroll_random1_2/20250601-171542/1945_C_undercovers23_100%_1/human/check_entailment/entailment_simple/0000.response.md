Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string s are both greater than or equal to 50%. It also handles the edge cases where no such index exists, and prints 0 if the percentage of ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%, and n otherwise.

The program correctly calculates the percentage of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the string for each index, and checks if both percentages are greater than or equal to 50%. If they are, it adds the index to the list of possible indices. It then finds the minimum index in the list that is closest to the middle of the string.

The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the string is even or odd, and calculates the middle index accordingly.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
