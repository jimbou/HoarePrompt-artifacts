Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers. The function then calculates the value of f by subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive integers and b, for each pair of consecutive integers. If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the variable t is 0.**
