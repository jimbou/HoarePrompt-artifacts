The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, the first test case is consumed, and the remaining test cases are still in stdin. The first test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers.**
