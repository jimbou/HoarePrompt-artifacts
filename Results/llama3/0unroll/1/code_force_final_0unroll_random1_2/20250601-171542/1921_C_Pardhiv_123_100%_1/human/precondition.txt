The input contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, where n is the number of messages, f is the initial phone charge, a is the charge consumption per unit of time, and b is the consumption when turned off and on sequentially. The second line contains n integers representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.
