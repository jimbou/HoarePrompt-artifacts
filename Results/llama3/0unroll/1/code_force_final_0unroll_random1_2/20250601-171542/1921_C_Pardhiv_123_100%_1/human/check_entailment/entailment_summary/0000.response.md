Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case (n, f, a, b), and the list of message moments (ls).
2.  The program initializes the list `ls` with a 0 at the beginning, which is necessary for the subsequent calculation of differences between consecutive message moments.
3.  The program calculates the remaining charge `f` after sending all messages by iterating over the list of message moments. For each pair of consecutive moments, it subtracts the minimum of two values from `f`:

    *   `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: This represents the charge consumed by keeping the phone on during the time interval between the two moments.
    *   `b`: This represents the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on.
4.  After processing all message moments, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
5.  The program repeats this process for all test cases, as indicated by the `while` loop that continues until `t` becomes 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
