Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers.

2. The program initializes a list `ls` with `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` integers from the second line of the input. This is done to simplify the calculation of the differences between consecutive integers.

3. The program then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration `i`, it calculates the minimum of two values: `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`. The first value represents the charge consumed if the phone is kept on from the previous moment to the current moment, and the second value represents the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and then turned on at the current moment.

4. The program subtracts the minimum of these two values from `f`, which represents the remaining charge.

5. After the loop, the program checks if `f` is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without running out of charge. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. The program repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the variable `t` is 0.

Correctness: **True**
