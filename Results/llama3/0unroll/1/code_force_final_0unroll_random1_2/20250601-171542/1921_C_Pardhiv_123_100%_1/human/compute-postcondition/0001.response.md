Output State: **t is 0, and the stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` becomes 0, and the stdin (standard input) is empty because all the test cases have been read and processed. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads two lines from the stdin, processes the input, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition. After all iterations, `t` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing, and the stdin is empty because all the test cases have been consumed.
