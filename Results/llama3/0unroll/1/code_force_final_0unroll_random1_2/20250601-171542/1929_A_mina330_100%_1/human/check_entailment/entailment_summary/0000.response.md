Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by rearranging the elements in ascending order, so that the largest difference is achieved.

The given program sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This is equivalent to calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the maximum beauty.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes all input values without modifying the original input or the number of test cases.

Correctness: **True**
