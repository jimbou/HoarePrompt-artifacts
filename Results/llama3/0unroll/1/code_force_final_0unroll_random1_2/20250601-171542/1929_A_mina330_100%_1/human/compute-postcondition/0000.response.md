Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `ntest` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 100. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
