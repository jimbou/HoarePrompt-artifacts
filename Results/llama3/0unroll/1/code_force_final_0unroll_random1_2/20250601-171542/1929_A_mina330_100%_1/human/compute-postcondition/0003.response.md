Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each test case, without modifying the original input values or the number of test cases. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.**
