Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array in ascending order and then subtracting the smallest element from the largest element. This is because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and by sorting the array, we maximize these differences. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the array has duplicate elements or where the array has only two elements.
