This function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a permutation of integers. It then sorts each permutation in ascending order and prints the sorted permutation to standard output. The function iterates over each test case, comparing pairs of elements to determine the correct order, and outputs the sorted result in the format specified by the problem.
