Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**.

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t pairs of integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 99. The value of `a` is now known to be the number of pairs of integers that will be input next.
