Functionality: **This function reads a series of input pairs (x, y) from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer t. For each pair, it calculates and prints the smallest integer z such that 15z - 4y is greater than or equal to x. The function does not return any value but instead prints the calculated z values directly to the standard output.**
