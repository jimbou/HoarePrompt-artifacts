Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using this operation.

The program iterates over the array from left to right, applying the operation as many times as possible at each index. If at any point an element becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If it successfully processes the entire array without encountering any negative elements, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach is correct because the operation can only decrease the values of the elements, and if an element becomes negative, it's impossible to make all elements zero. Also, the last two elements must be zero at the end because the operation can only decrease their values.

Correctness: **True**
