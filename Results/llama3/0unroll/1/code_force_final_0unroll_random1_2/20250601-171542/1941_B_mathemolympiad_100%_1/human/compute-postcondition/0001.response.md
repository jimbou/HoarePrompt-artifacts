Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, indicating whether each test case can be solved by subtracting operations from the array elements. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the number of test cases (numTest). The values of numTest and the input test cases will remain unchanged.**
