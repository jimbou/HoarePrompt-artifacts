Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from left to right and applying the operation as many times as possible at each index. The number of operations applied at each index is determined by the value of the current element, which is subtracted from the current element, twice the value is subtracted from the next element, and the value is subtracted from the element after next.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has less than 3 elements. In such cases, the program will not be able to apply the operation and will incorrectly print "NO".

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has 3 elements. In such cases, the program will apply the operation to the first element, but it will not be able to apply the operation to the second element, which will result in an incorrect answer.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the value of an element is negative. In such cases, the program will incorrectly print "NO" without checking if the operation can be applied to make the element zero.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the values of the elements is not a multiple of 3. In such cases, the program will incorrectly print "YES" even though it is not possible to make all elements zero.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the value of the last element is not zero. In such cases, the program will incorrectly print "YES" even though it is not possible to make all elements zero.

6. The program does not correctly handle the case where the value of the second last element is not zero. In such cases, the program will incorrectly print "YES" even though it is not possible to make all elements zero.

Considering these issues, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
