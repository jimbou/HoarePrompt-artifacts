The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `numTest`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). The value of `numTest` is equal to the first integer t in the input. The stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).

Output State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `numTest` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).**
