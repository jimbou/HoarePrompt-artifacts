Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "NO". The reason is that the program only checks if the last two elements of the array are zero, but it does not check if the entire array can be made zero using the given operation.

In this case, the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] cannot be made zero using the operation because the first element is 1, which is less than the required 2 to perform the operation.

The program should check if the entire array can be made zero, not just the last two elements.
