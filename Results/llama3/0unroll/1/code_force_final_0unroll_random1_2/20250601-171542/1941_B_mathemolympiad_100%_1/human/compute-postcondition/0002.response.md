Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then attempts to solve each test case by subtracting operations from the array elements, and prints 'YES' if the test case can be solved and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case, without modifying the input values.**
