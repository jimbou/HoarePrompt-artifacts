Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'yes' or 'no' printed to the console, one for each test case. The 'yes' indicates that the given strings do not contain any adjacent '<' characters, while 'no' indicates that such adjacent '<' characters exist. The number of 'yes' or 'no' printed will be equal to the number of test cases (t). The value of t, n, a, and b will remain unchanged.**
