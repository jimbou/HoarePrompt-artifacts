Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program checks for the existence of adjacent '<' characters in the input strings a and b, which represent the arrows in the grid. If such adjacent '<' characters are found, it prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). If no such adjacent '<' characters are found, it prints 'yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The program's logic is based on the fact that if there are adjacent '<' characters in the grid, the robot will be trapped in an infinite loop and cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if there are no adjacent '<' characters, the robot can always move to the right and eventually reach the cell (2, n).

The program's implementation is correct, as it correctly checks for the existence of adjacent '<' characters in the input strings and prints the corresponding output.

Correctness: **True**
