Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, checking if there are any adjacent '<' characters in the current column and the next column. If it finds such a pair, it immediately prints 'No' and moves on to the next test case. If it doesn't find any such pairs after checking all columns, it prints 'yes'.

This logic is correct because if there are adjacent '<' characters in the current column and the next column, it means that the robot cannot move to the right in the current column, and therefore cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if there are no such adjacent '<' characters, it means that the robot can always move to the right and eventually reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
