The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two strings of length n. It checks if the strings contain any adjacent '<' characters and prints 'yes' if no such adjacent characters exist, and 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to the console, one for each test case.
