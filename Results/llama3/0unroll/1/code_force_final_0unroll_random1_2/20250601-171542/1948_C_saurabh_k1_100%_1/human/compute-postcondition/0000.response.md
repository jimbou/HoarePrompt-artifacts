Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^4, which was read from the input. The rest of the input remains the same, containing `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. The sum of `n` over all test cases still doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
