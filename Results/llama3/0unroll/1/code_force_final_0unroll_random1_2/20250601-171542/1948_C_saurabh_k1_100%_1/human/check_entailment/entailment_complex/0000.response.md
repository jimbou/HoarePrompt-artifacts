Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each pair of cells, it checks if the arrows in both cells point to the left ('<'). If it finds such a pair, it immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop, as this indicates that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

If the loop completes without finding any such pairs, it prints 'yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The program correctly handles the constraints on the input, including the fact that n is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.

Correctness: **True**
