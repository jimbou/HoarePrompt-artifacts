Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print 'yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

The program only checks if there are any '<' arrows in the even columns, but it does not consider the case where the robot can get stuck in a loop. A correct solution would need to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) without getting stuck in a loop.
