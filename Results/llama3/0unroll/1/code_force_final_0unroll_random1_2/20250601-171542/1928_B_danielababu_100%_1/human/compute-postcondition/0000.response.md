Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is an empty list, tem is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `ans` and `tem`, without modifying the existing variable `arr`. The first line creates an empty list and assigns it to `ans`, while the second line assigns the value 1 to `tem`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, as the code does not interact with it.
