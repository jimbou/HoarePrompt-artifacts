This function calculates and returns the cumulative products of a list of positive integers. It takes a list of positive integers as input, iterates through the list, and for each element, it multiplies the current cumulative product by the current element and appends the result to a new list. The function returns this new list containing the cumulative products of the input list, leaving the original input list unchanged.
