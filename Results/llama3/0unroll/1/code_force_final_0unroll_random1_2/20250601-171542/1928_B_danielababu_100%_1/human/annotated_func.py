    return int(input())
    #The program returns a non-negative integer that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers provided in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a list of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as space-separated input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were in the space-separated list of integers in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of space-separated values of any type and value.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a string representation of each value from the input string, split into separate elements by spaces. Each value in the map object is a string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of space-separated values from standard input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to a string, and returns a map object containing these string representations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters in the string that is in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings that were provided as input, sorted in ascending order. The list contains all the strings that were in the original input, each string is a separate element in the list, and the strings are arranged in alphabetical order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, splits them into individual elements, sorts them in ascending alphabetical order, and returns the sorted list of strings.

    #State: To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
    #   - `ans` is an empty list.
    #   - `tem` is 1.
    #
    #2. **Loop Analysis**:
    #   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr`.
    #   - In each iteration, `tem` is multiplied by the current element of `arr`.
    #   - The updated value of `tem` is then appended to the list `ans`.
    #
    #3. **Output State Calculation**:
    #   - After the loop finishes, `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr`.
    #   - `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` as the loop progresses. Specifically, it will hold the product of the first element, the product of the first two elements, the product of the first three elements, and so on, until the product of all elements.
    #
    #4. **Output State**:
    #   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`.
    #   - `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    #
    #**Output State**: arr remains a list of positive integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in arr, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' that contains the cumulative products of the elements in list 'arr', where 'arr' is a list of positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the cumulative products of a list of positive integers. It takes a list of positive integers as input, iterates through the list, and for each element, it multiplies the current cumulative product by the current element and appends the result to a new list. The function returns this new list containing the cumulative products of the input list, leaving the original input list unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: The list ans contains the cumulative product of the elements in arr in reverse order, and tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in arr in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of non-negative integers in reverse order and returns the result as a list. It takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the cumulative product of the input elements in reverse order. The function does not modify the original input list.
