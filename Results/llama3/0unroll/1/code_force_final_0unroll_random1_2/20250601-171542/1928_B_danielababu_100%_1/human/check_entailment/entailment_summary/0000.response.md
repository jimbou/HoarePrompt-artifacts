Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to the array. The program uses a combination of functions to read input, sort the array, and calculate the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases using `func_1()`. Then, for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` and the elements of the array using `func_3()`. The array is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.

The program then calculates the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number by iterating through the sorted array and using the `bisect_left()` function to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the current element plus `n`. The difference between this index and the current index is the number of elements that can be equal to the same number. The maximum of these values is stored in the `ans` variable.

Finally, the program prints the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number for each test case.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to be correct. The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` read input correctly, and the `sorted()` function sorts the array correctly. The `bisect_left()` function is used correctly to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the current element plus `n`. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
