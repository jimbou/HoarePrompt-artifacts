Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the provided periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and stores it in the variable `t`.

2. It then reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a) for each test case, storing them in the `test_cases` list.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases (t) and the list of test cases as input.

4. Inside the `func_1` function, the program iterates over each test case. For each test case, it initializes a variable `current_year` to 0.

5. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs (a) for the current test case. For each periodicity (ai), it checks if the current year is a multiple of ai. If it is, the next year is calculated as the current year plus ai. If it's not, the next year is calculated as the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than the current year.

6. The program updates the `current_year` variable with the calculated `next_year`.

7. After iterating over all the periodicities for the current test case, the program appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.

8. Finally, the program returns the `results` list, which contains the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case.

9. The program prints the results for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
