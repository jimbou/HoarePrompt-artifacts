Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, calculates the next occurrence of each sign, and updates the current year accordingly.

The key part of the program is the calculation of the next occurrence of each sign, which is done using the following logic:

* If the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the next occurrence is in the current year plus the periodicity.
* If the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the next occurrence is in the next multiple of the periodicity after the current year.

This logic is correctly implemented in the program using the following code:

```python
if current_year % ai == 0:
    next_year = current_year + ai
else:
    next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```

The program then updates the current year to the next occurrence of the sign and repeats this process for all signs.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
