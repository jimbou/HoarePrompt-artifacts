#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each sublist is a positive integer n, and the rest of the sublist are n positive integers.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each sublist is a positive integer `n`, and the rest of the sublist are `n` positive integers, `results` is a list of positive integers, where each integer is the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over the corresponding sublist in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over the corresponding sublist in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over each sublist in the input list of test cases. It takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The function returns a list of positive integers, where each integer represents the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over the corresponding sublist in the input test cases.
