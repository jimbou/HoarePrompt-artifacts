Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the list of sign periodicities. It correctly calculates the next year when each sign will occur by checking if the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity. If it is, the next year is the current year plus the periodicity. If it's not, the next year is the next multiple of the periodicity after the current year. The program then updates the current year to the next year and continues with the next sign. Finally, it appends the year when the last sign occurs to the results list.

Correctness: **True**
