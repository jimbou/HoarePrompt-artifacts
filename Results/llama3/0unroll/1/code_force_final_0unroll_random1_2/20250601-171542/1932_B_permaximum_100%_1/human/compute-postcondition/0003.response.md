Output State: **The program returns a list of positive integers, where each integer is the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over the corresponding sublist in `test_cases`.**

In this output state, the returned list `results` contains positive integers that represent the maximum year achievable for each sublist in `test_cases`. Each integer in `results` corresponds to the maximum year that can be achieved by iterating over the corresponding sublist in `test_cases`, where the first element of each sublist is a positive integer `n`, and the rest of the sublist are `n` positive integers.
