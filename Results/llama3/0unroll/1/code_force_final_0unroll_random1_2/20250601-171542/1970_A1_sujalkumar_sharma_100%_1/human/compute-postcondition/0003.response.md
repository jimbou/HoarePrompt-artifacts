Output State: **prefix_balance is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance of open and close parentheses, the index of the current character, and the current character itself, sorted by the balance and then by the index in descending order, balance is 0, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, result is a string consisting of the characters in prefix_balance, in the order they appear after sorting.**

In this output state, the list prefix_balance has been sorted based on the balance of open and close parentheses and the index of the current character. The balance remains 0, indicating that the string s is still a balanced parentheses sequence. The string s and its length n remain unchanged. The new variable result is a string consisting of the characters in prefix_balance, in the order they appear after sorting.
