Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle is defined as the sequence obtained by sorting the characters of the input sequence based on the balance of their prefixes, breaking ties in decreasing order of position.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns its balanced shuffle.

3. Inside the function, it first initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store the balance of each prefix, the position of each character, and the character itself.

4. It then iterates over the input string `s`, calculating the balance of each prefix by incrementing the balance when it encounters an opening parenthesis and decrementing it when it encounters a closing parenthesis.

5. After calculating the balance for each prefix, it appends a tuple containing the balance, position, and character to the `prefix_balance` list.

6. The `prefix_balance` list is then sorted based on the balance of the prefixes in ascending order, and in case of a tie, it is sorted in descending order of position.

7. Finally, it joins the characters in the sorted `prefix_balance` list to form the balanced shuffle of the input sequence and returns it.

8. The main part of the program reads a string from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and passes it to the `func_1` function. It then prints the result returned by the function.

9. The example input and output provided in the problem description match the expected behavior of the program.

10. Based on the above steps, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
