Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments. It iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to the number of test cases (t) minus 1.

3. Inside the loop, it reads the number of integers (n) and the list of integers (l) from the input. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.

4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0 and then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., it considers pairs of adjacent integers). For each pair, it adds the smaller integer (l[i]) to the `score`.

5. After processing all pairs, it prints the final `score`.

6. The program's logic is correct because it sorts the list of integers and then iterates over the sorted list in pairs, adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score. This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved, as it always chooses the smaller integer from each pair.

7. The program handles the input correctly, reading the number of test cases, the number of integers, and the list of integers for each test case.

8. The program's output is correct, as it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
