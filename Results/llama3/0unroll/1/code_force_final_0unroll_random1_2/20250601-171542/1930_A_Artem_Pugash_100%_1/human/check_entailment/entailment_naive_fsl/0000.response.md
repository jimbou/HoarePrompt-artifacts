Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `l`.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element (index 0). For each pair of elements, it adds the smaller element to the `score`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score, which is to always choose the smaller element from each pair of elements. By sorting the list, the program ensures that the smaller element is always chosen, resulting in the maximum final score.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
