Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), adding the smallest number in each pair to the `score`. This is because the problem statement allows us to choose the minimum of the two numbers in each pair, and by sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest number in each pair is always the first one.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The program correctly implements the greedy strategy described in the problem statement, which is to always choose the minimum of the two numbers in each pair to maximize the final score.

Correctness: **True**
