Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the smallest n numbers in each test case, and prints the sum for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the sum of the smallest n numbers for each case.**
