Reasoning:

The program is correct because it follows the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score. By sorting the integers in ascending order, the program ensures that the smallest n numbers are selected and added to the score. This is because the smallest number in each pair is added to the score, and by selecting the smallest n numbers, the program maximizes the total score.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The use of a for loop to iterate over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`) ensures that the smallest n numbers are selected and added to the score.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
