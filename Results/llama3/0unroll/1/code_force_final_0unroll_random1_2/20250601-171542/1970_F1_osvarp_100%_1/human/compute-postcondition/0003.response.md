Output State: **The grid is populated with n lines of input from stdin, each line split into a list of elements. The elements dictionary is updated with the positions of all non-'..' elements in the grid. The allPlayers dictionary contains all player elements from the grid with their initial state set to False. The goal list contains the positions of all 'G' elements in the grid, separated by team ('B' or 'W'). The values of n, m, and points remain unchanged. The variable t is assigned the value of an integer read from stdin.**

In this output state, the variable t is assigned the value of an integer read from stdin, while the other variables and data structures remain unchanged. The grid, elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal list, n, m, and points retain their initial values and properties.
