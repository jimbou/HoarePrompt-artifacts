Output State: **B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of integers, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of integers, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, l is 0, r is the length of B.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a new variable. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `l`, and the second line assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. These assignments do not affect the values of any existing variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial variables with their original values, and the two new variables `l` and `r` with their assigned values.
