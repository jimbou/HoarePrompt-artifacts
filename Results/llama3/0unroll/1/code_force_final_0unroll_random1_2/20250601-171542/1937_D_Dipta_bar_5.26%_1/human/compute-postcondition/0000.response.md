Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

The code first assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` consists of characters '<' and '>', the length of `s` is the number of these characters. The second line initializes an empty list `A`. The third line initializes an empty list `idx_A`. No other variables are affected.
