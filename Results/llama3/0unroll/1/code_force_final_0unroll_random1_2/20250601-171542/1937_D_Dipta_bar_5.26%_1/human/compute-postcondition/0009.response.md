Functionality: **This function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a series of numbers separated by spaces. The numbers are calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function iterates through the string, maintaining two lists `A` and `B` to keep track of the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters. It then uses these lists to calculate and print the numbers. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the calculated numbers directly.**
