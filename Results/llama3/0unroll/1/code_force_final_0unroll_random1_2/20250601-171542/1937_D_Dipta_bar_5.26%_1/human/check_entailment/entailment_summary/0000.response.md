Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two lists, A and B, to keep track of the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. It then uses these lists to calculate the numbers of seconds for each query.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the pinball is placed on the leftmost or rightmost cell, and when the string contains only '<' or only '>' characters. The program also correctly handles the case when the pinball moves to the left or right and the character at the current position is inverted.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program is correct, as it prints the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
