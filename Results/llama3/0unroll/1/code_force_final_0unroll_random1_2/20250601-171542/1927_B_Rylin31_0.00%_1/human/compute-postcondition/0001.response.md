Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then modifies each test case by replacing each number with a letter from the alphabet, determined by the count of the number in the reversed array minus one. The modified arrays are then printed out as strings, one for each test case.**
