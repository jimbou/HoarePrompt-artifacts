Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make the first and last characters of the grid the same by changing characters in the grid, without changing the characters in the first and last rows and columns. The value of `t` will remain unchanged. The input from stdin will be consumed and not available for further use.**
