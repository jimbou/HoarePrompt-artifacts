Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 500), followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' and 'B'.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which includes two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 500), followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' and 'B'.
