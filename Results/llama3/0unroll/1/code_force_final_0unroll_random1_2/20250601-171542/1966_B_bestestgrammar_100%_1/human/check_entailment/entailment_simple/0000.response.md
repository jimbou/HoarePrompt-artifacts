Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program reads the input from stdin, which contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, representing the number of rows and columns in the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' and 'B'.

The program initializes an empty list gr to store the grid, and a variable ans to store the answer, which is initially set to 'YES'. It then checks if the first and last characters of the grid are different. If they are, it sets a flag impossible to True and checks the first and last rows and columns of the grid for any adjacent characters that are different. If it finds any, it sets impossible to False. If impossible is still True after checking, it sets ans to 'NO'.

The program then prints the value of ans, which indicates whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
