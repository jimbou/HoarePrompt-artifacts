Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first reads the input and stores it in a 2D list `gr`. It then checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it checks if there is a row or column that has different colors. If such a row or column exists, it means that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing operations. If no such row or column exists, it means that it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that operations can only be performed on squares of the same color, and that the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid must be the same color in order for all squares to be the same color.

Correctness: **True**
