Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations, because there are no white squares to start with.

The program only checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and if not, it checks if there are any adjacent squares of the same color in the top or bottom row, or in the left or right column. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color. The program does not consider the case where all squares are the same color to begin with, and it does not check if there are any other possible operations that could make all squares the same color.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
