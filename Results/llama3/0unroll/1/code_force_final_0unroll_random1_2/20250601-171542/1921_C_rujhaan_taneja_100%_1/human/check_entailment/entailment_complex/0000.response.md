Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence and a, and the product of the number of remaining elements and b. It then compares this sum to f and prints 'Yes' if the sum is less than f, and 'No' otherwise.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the difference between consecutive numbers is less than b/a, in which case it appends the product of the difference and a to array2. It also handles the case when the difference is greater than or equal to b/a, in which case it does not append anything to array2.

The program also correctly calculates the sum of the values in array2 and the product of the number of remaining elements and b, and compares this sum to f.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
