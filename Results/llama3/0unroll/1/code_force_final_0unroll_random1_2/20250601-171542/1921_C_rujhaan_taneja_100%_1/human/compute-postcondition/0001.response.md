Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, indicating whether the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and b is less than f for each test case. The values of test_cases, stdin, and the initial input values remain unchanged.**
