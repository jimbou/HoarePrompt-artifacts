Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers representing a sequence of numbers. The function calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence and a, and the product of the number of remaining elements and b. It then compares this sum to f and prints 'Yes' if the sum is less than f, and 'No' otherwise. The function repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results to the console.**
