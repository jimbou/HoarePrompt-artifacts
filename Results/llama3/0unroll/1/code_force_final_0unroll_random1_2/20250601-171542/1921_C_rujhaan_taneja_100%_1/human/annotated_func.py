#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed to the console, indicating whether the sum of the calculated values in array2 plus the product of the number of remaining elements and b is less than f for each test case. The values of test_cases, stdin, and the initial input values remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n integers representing a sequence of numbers. The function calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence and a, and the product of the number of remaining elements and b. It then compares this sum to f and prints 'Yes' if the sum is less than f, and 'No' otherwise. The function repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results to the console.
