Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).**

The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. The value of `test_cases` is a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases. The state of the standard input is updated, as one integer has been read from it. The remaining test cases are still present in the standard input, each containing two lines as described in the initial state.
