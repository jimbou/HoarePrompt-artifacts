Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the total charge spent.

In the program, the total charge spent is calculated as the sum of the charge spent on turning the phone on and off (b) for each message, plus the charge spent on keeping the phone on for the time intervals where the phone is not turned off. However, this calculation is incorrect.

The correct calculation should take into account the fact that the phone loses charge at a rate of a units per unit of time, and that the phone can be turned off and on at any moment. The program should calculate the total charge spent by considering all possible scenarios of turning the phone on and off, and choosing the scenario that minimizes the total charge spent.

For example, consider the case where n = 2, f = 10, a = 1, b = 5, and the messages are sent at moments 3 and 6. The program would calculate the total charge spent as (3 * 1) + (6 - 3) * 1 + 2 * 5 = 17, which is incorrect. The correct calculation would be to turn off the phone at moment 0, turn it on at moment 3, send the first message, turn off the phone at moment 3, turn it on at moment 6, send the second message, and turn off the phone at moment 6. The total charge spent would be (3 * 1) + 5 + (6 - 3) * 1 + 5 = 15.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone, and the correctness is **False**.
