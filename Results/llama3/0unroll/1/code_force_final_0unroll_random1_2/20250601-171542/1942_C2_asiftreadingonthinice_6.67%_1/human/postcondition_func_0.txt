This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of operations required to make an array a palindrome. It takes no parameters and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations for a test case, capped at n-2. The function iterates through each test case, sorts the input array, and calculates the minimum number of operations by analyzing gaps between elements and the array's boundaries. It then prints the result for each test case.
