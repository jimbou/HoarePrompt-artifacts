Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program will try to access `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` when `i` is equal to `len(a)`, which will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

This is because the program assumes that `x` is always less than `n`, but the problem statement does not guarantee this. Therefore, the program does not handle this edge case correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that `x` is less than `n` before accessing `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
