The code `tt = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tt`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Since the first integer is accepted and assigned to `tt`, the stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains tt test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
