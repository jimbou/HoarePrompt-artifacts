Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program precomputes the sum of the numbers on the board for all possible values of n from 1 to 200000 and stores them in an array A.
3. The program then reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads the value of n and prints the corresponding sum from the precomputed array A.
4. The function func_1 calculates the sum of the digits of a given number num.
5. The program uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to 200000 and adds it to the sum.
6. The program uses the precomputed array A to print the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
