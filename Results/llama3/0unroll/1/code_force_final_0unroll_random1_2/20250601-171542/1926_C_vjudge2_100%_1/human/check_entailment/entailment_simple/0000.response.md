Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A.

The program then reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads an integer n and prints the value of A[n-1], which is the sum of the numbers on the board for the given n.

The function func_1 is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. It works by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (num % 10), adding it to the sum a, and removing the last digit from the number (num = int(num / 10)). This process continues until the number becomes 0.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the following aspects:

1.  The precomputation approach is correct because it calculates the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. This allows the program to efficiently retrieve the sum for any given n.
2.  The function func_1 is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit and adding it to the sum.
3.  The program correctly handles the input and output for each test case by reading the number of test cases t, reading an integer n for each test case, and printing the corresponding value from the precomputed array A.

Based on this analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
