Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach, where it calculates the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum for the given number n.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given positive integer. It iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to the sum, and then removes the digit from the number. This process continues until the number becomes 0.

The main program correctly uses the precomputed sums to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number n and prints the precomputed sum A[n-1].

The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, since it simply looks up the precomputed sum in the array A. This is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
