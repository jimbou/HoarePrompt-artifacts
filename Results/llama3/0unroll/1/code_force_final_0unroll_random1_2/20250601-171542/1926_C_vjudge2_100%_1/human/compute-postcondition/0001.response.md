Output State: **a is the sum of the digits of the initial value of num, num is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`. For example, if the initial value of `num` is 12345, the output state will be `a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15` and `num = 0`. The value of `num` is always 0 in the output state because the loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
