#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: a is the sum of the digits of the initial value of num, num is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the sum of the digits of the initial value of num, and since num is 0, a is also 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given positive integer. It takes an integer as input, decomposes it into its individual digits, and returns their sum. The input integer is reduced to 0 in the process.
