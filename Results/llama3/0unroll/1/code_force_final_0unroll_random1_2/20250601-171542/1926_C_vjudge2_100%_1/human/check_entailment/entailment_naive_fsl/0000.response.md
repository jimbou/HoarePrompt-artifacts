Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the results in the list A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the corresponding value from the list A.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number divided by 10 (num % 10) and adding it to the sum, and then dividing the number by 10 (int(num / 10)).

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1, 2, or 200,000. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
