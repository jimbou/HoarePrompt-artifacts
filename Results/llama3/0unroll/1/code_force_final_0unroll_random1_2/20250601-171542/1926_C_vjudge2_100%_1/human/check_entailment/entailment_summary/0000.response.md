Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to calculate the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number n.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of pre-computation allows the program to avoid redundant calculations and meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
