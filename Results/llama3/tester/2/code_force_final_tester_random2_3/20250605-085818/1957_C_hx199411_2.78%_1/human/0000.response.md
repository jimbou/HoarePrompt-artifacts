# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With a 4x4 chessboard and one move already played (1, 2), the code should output 3, which represents the three possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle larger chessboards and different move positions. With an 8x8 chessboard and one move already played (7, 6), the code should output 331, which represents the possible final configurations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle very large chessboards and multiple moves. With a 1000x1000 chessboard and four moves already played, the code should output 671968183, which represents the possible final configurations.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there are no moves played. With a 1x1 chessboard and no moves played, the code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when all possible moves have been played. With a 2x2 chessboard and two moves already played, the code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when all possible moves have been played on a larger chessboard. With a 3x3 chessboard and three moves already played, the code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000 1000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard is very large and all possible moves have been played. With a 1000x1000 chessboard and 1000 moves already played, the code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard size is 0. The code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
-1 0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid chessboard size
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard size is negative. The code should output an error message indicating that the chessboard size is invalid.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 -1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid number of moves
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of moves is negative. The code should output an error message indicating that the number of moves is invalid.
