# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string "a" is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings (each lowercase English alphabet) are subsequences of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The expected output is "NO" because not all possible strings of length 26 are subsequences of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". The expected output is "YES" because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 0 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". The expected output is "YES" because there are no possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using 0 alphabets.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
a
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of an empty string. The expected output is "NO" because there are no characters in the empty string to form a subsequence.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of an empty string. The expected output is "YES" because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
