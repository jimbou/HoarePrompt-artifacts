# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is a sequence of size 1 with the element 1, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 6 and k = 1. The expected output is a sequence of size 5 with elements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 8 and k = 8. The expected output is a sequence of size 7 with elements 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 9 and k = 3. The expected output is a sequence of size 4 with elements 7, 1, 4, and 1, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 10 and k = 7. The expected output is a sequence of size 4 with elements 1, 2, 8, and 3, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1, which is an edge case. The expected output is an empty sequence, as there is no subsequence that can satisfy the conditions.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1000000 and k = 1000000, which is an edge case. The expected output is a sequence of size 25 with elements 1, 1, 1, ..., 1, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 1, which is an edge case. The expected output is a sequence of size 1 with the element 2, which satisfies the conditions.
