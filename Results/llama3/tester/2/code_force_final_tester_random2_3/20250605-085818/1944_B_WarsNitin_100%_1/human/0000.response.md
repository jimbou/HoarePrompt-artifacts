This test case covers the basic scenario where n = 2 and k = 1. The input array a contains the integers from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6 4
1 3
```
This test case covers a larger input size (n = 6) and k = 1. The input array a contains the integers from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

**Output**: 
```
1 2

This test case covers a scenario where n = 4 and k = 1. The input array a contains the integers from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 4

This test case covers a scenario where n = 6 and k = 2. The input array a contains the integers from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**:

**Output**: 
```
1 1

This test case covers an edge case where n = 2 and k = 1, and the input array a contains duplicate integers. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2

```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4

This test case covers an edge case where n = 5 and k = 2, and the input array a contains the integers from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
This test case covers an edge case where n = 1 and k = 1, and the input array a contains only one integer. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.
