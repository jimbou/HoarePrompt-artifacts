# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a simple scenario where Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 2. The expected output is 4, which corresponds to the number of different k values that fit the given constraints (k = 2, 3, 5, 6).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the only possible k value (k = 2).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a more complex scenario where Vasya's position is 76 and the number he received is 4. The expected output is 9, which corresponds to the number of different k values that fit the given constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks an edge case where Vasya's position is 100 and the number he received is 99. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no possible k values that fit the given constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a large input scenario where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 500 million. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the only possible k value.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks an edge case where Vasya's position is 1 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no possible k values that fit the given constraints, since k > 1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks an edge case where Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the only possible k value (k = 2).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a large input scenario where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no possible k values that fit the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a large input scenario where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 999 million. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no possible k values that fit the given constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a large input scenario where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is also 1 billion. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no possible k values that fit the given constraints.
