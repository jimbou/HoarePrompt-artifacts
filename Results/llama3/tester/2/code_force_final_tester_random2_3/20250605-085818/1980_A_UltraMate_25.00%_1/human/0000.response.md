# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input string has 10 problems, but only 5 unique difficulty levels ('B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D'). The function should output 2, as Vlad needs to come up with 2 more problems of difficulty levels 'A' and 'F' to hold 1 round.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than 1. The input string has 10 problems, but only 5 unique difficulty levels ('B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D'). The function should output 5, as Vlad needs to come up with 5 more problems of difficulty levels 'A', 'F', 'A', 'F', and one more of any level to hold 2 rounds.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string has fewer problems than the number of rounds. The input string has 9 problems, but only 6 unique difficulty levels ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'). The function should output 1, as Vlad needs to come up with 1 more problem of difficulty level 'A' to hold 1 round.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string has exactly the same number of unique difficulty levels as the number of rounds. The input string has 5 problems, each with a unique difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'). The function should output 0, as Vlad already has enough problems to hold 5 rounds.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string is empty. The function should output 7, as Vlad needs to come up with 7 problems of all difficulty levels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G') to hold 1 round.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is 0. The function should output 0, as Vlad doesn't need to come up with any problems to hold 0 rounds.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than the number of unique difficulty levels in the input string. The input string has 10 problems, but only 5 unique difficulty levels ('B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D'). The function should output 7, as Vlad needs to come up with 7 more problems of all difficulty levels ('A', 'F', 'A', 'F', 'A', 'F', 'A') to hold 10 rounds.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
AAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string has only one unique difficulty level. The input string has 10 problems, all with difficulty level 'A'. The function should output 6, as Vlad needs to come up with 6 more problems of difficulty levels 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G' to hold 1 round.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BCDEFGAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string has some unique difficulty levels, but not all. The input string has 10 problems, with 6 unique difficulty levels ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A'). The function should output 1, as Vlad needs to come up with 1 more problem of difficulty level 'A' to hold 1 round.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
ABCDEFGAA
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string has all unique difficulty levels, but some are repeated. The input string has 10 problems, with 7 unique difficulty levels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'). The function should output 0, as Vlad already has enough problems to hold 1 round.
