# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has only one element, which is 0. The expected output is 0 because there is no possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [0].

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has only one element, which is 1. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [1].

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
-1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has three elements. The expected output is 0 because there is no possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2].

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
5
-1 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has five elements. The expected output is 3 because there are three possible arrays a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1].

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
5
-4 -3 -3 -2 -1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has five elements. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1].

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has two identical elements. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [1, 1].

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
2
-1 -1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has two identical negative elements. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, -1].

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has three identical elements, all of which are 0. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [0, 0, 0].

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
4
-2 -1 -1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has four elements. The expected output is 2 because there are two possible arrays a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-2, -1, -1, 0].

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
5000
-5000 -4999 -4998 ... 4998 4999 5000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array has 5000 elements, ranging from -5000 to 5000. The expected output is 1 because there is exactly one possible array a that can result in a sorted prefix sum array p = [-5000, -4999, -4998, ..., 4998, 4999, 5000].
