# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
This test case covers a basic scenario with three outcomes and multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
This test case checks a simple scenario with two outcomes and equal multipliers. The expected output is a minimal distribution of coins that still allows for a profit.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
This test case evaluates a scenario where all multipliers are the same, making it impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
This test case covers a more complex scenario with six outcomes and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
This test case checks a scenario where the multipliers are such that it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
This test case evaluates a scenario with five outcomes and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers a simple scenario with only one outcome. The expected output is a minimal distribution of coins that still allows for a profit.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This test case checks a scenario with the maximum number of outcomes (50) and equal multipliers. The expected output is a minimal distribution of coins that still allows for a profit.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
This test case evaluates a scenario with the maximum number of outcomes (50) and the maximum multiplier (20). The expected output is -1, indicating that it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers a simple scenario with only one outcome and the maximum multiplier. The expected output is a minimal distribution of coins that still allows for a profit.
