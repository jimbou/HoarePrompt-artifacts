# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array has 3 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9
```
**Output**: 
```
7 2 2 7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs. The input array has 4 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
5 10 5 16 3 3 13 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
3 5 5 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs with repeated sums. The input array has 4 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
8 10 4 6 4 20 14 14 6
```
**Output**: 
```
6 4 4 6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs with repeated sums. The input array has 4 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs with a large number of sums. The input array has 5 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
5
1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 5 5 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs with a large number of sums. The input array has 5 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
500000000 500000000 500000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large input values. The input array has 3 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle edge cases. The input array has only 1 element, and the sum of its only subarray is given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle edge cases. The input array has only 2 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000
[large input]
```
**Output**: 
```
[large output]
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large inputs. The input array has 1000 elements, and the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays are given. The function should recover the original palindrome array.
