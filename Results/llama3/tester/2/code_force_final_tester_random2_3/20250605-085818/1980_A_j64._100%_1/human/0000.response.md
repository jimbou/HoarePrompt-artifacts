# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input contains 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'E', and 'D'. The function should output 2, as Vlad needs to come up with two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than 1. The input contains the same 10 problems as in Test 1, but the number of rounds is 2. The function should output 5, as Vlad needs to come up with five problems: one of difficulty level 'A', one of difficulty level 'F', and three more problems to cover the remaining difficulties.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of problems is less than 10. The input contains 9 problems with difficulties 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'G', and 'G'. The function should output 1, as Vlad needs to come up with one problem: one of difficulty level 'A'.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
A
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of problems is 1 and the difficulty level is 'A'. The function should output 0, as Vlad already has a problem of difficulty level 'A' and does not need to come up with any new problems.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
A
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than the number of problems. The input contains 1 problem with difficulty level 'A', but the number of rounds is 5. The function should output 6, as Vlad needs to come up with six problems: one of difficulty level 'B', one of difficulty level 'C', one of difficulty level 'D', one of difficulty level 'E', one of difficulty level 'F', and one of difficulty level 'G'.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of problems is 0. The function should output 7, as Vlad needs to come up with seven problems: one of difficulty level 'A', one of difficulty level 'B', one of difficulty level 'C', one of difficulty level 'D', one of difficulty level 'E', one of difficulty level 'F', and one of difficulty level 'G'.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of problems is equal to the number of difficulty levels. The input contains 7 problems with difficulties 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. The function should output 0, as Vlad already has problems of all difficulty levels and does not need to come up with any new problems.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than 1, but the number of problems is equal to the number of difficulty levels. The input contains the same 7 problems as in Test 7, but the number of rounds is 5. The function should output 0, as Vlad already has problems of all difficulty levels and does not need to come up with any new problems.
