# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It should return 2 because removing the edge 1-3 will result in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of edges to be removed is equal to the number of edges in the tree. It should return 1 because removing the only edge will result in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree is a straight line. It should return 3 because removing the edge 3-4 will result in two connected components with at least 3 vertices each.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of edges to be removed is equal to the number of edges in the tree minus one. It should return 1 because removing the edge 1-2 will result in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4

3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree is a star. It should return 1 because removing the edges 1-2 and 1-3 will result in three connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has multiple branches. It should return 2 because removing the edges 1-2 and 4-5 will result in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.
