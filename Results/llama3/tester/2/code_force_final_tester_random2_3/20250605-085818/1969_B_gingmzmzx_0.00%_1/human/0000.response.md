# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input string "10" requires a cyclic shift to become sorted in non-descending order, which can be achieved by choosing the whole string and performing a cyclic shift, resulting in a cost of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles already sorted strings. The input string "0000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
11000
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle strings with multiple operations required to sort them. The input string "11000" requires three operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 3, resulting in a total cost of 9.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
101011
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's performance on strings with alternating 0s and 1s. The input string "101011" requires two operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 2 and 3, respectively, resulting in a total cost of 5.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
01101001
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's ability to handle longer strings with multiple operations required to sort them. The input string "01101001" requires four operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 2, 3, 3, and 3, respectively, resulting in a total cost of 11.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior on single-character strings. The input string "1" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles single-character strings with a value of 0. The input string "0" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
11111111
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance on strings consisting of only 1s. The input string "11111111" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior on strings consisting of only 0s. The input string "00000000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
01010101
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's ability to handle strings with alternating 0s and 1s. The input string "01010101" requires four operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 8.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10101010
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance on strings with alternating 0s and 1s. The input string "10101010" requires four operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 8.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10000001
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle strings with a single 1 surrounded by 0s. The input string "10000001" requires two operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 4, resulting in a total cost of 8.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
01111110
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance on strings with a single 0 surrounded by 1s. The input string "01111110" requires two operations to become sorted, each with a cost of 4, resulting in a total cost of 8.

# Test 14
**Input**:
