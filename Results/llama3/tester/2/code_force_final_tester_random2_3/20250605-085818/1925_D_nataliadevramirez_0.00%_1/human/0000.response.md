# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
55
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. There is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The teacher goes on 10 excursions, and each time the pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected sum of friendship values is 1+2+3+...+10 = 55.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**:
```
40000020
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle multiple pairs of friends with different initial friendship values. There are two pairs of friends with initial friendship values of 25 and 24, respectively. The teacher goes on 4 excursions, and the expected sum of friendship values is calculated accordingly.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there are no pairs of friends. The expected sum of friendship values is 0, as there are no friendships to increase.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle a single excursion. There is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The teacher goes on 1 excursion, and the expected sum of friendship values is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 100
1 2 10
2 3 20
3 4 30
4 5 40
5 6 50
```
**Output**:
```
<expected output>
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle multiple pairs of friends with different initial friendship values and a large number of excursions. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated accordingly.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
100000 100000 200000
<100000 pairs of friends with initial friendship values>
```
**Output**:
```
<expected output>
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance and scalability with a large number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated accordingly.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 200000
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
<expected output>
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a large number of excursions and a large initial friendship value. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated accordingly.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100 0 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when there are no pairs of friends and a large number of excursions. The expected sum of friendship values is 0, as there are no friendships to increase.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a single excursion and a large initial friendship value. The expected sum of friendship values is 1000000000.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100000 100000 1
<100000 pairs of friends with initial friendship values>
```
**Output**:
```
<expected output>
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance and scalability with a large number of children, pairs of friends, and a single excursion. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated accordingly.
