# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
2
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a simple scenario where Alice has 7 coins and Bob wants her to buy 3 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up one stall with a price of 2, allowing Alice to buy 3 jewels and have 1 coin left.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins. The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy exactly 4 jewels.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has a large number of coins (255) and Bob wants her to buy 8 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up 8 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy 1 jewel. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy 1 jewel.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels (10^18). The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy 10^18 jewels.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 10^18 - 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy one less than the maximum possible number of jewels (10^18 - 1). The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy exactly 10^18 - 1 jewels.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
10^18
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy only 1 jewel. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up one stall with a price of 10^18, allowing Alice to buy 1 jewel.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels (10^18). The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy exactly 10^18 jewels.
