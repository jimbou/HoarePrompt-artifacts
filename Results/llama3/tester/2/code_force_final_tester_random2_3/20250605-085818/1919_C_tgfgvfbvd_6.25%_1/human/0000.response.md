# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with repeated elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with all elements being the same. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with only one element. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with only two elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle empty arrays. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as the number of indices where the element in s is less than the element in t.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid input. The array is not split into two subsequences, and an error message is returned.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid input. The array is not split into two subsequences, and an error message is returned.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid input. The array is not split into two subsequences, and an error message is returned.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
[1, 2, 3]
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid input. The array is not split into two subsequences, and an error message is returned.
