# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when all possible strings of length n can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when not all possible strings of length n can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of s. It also checks if the function correctly prints a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a larger input size and checks if it correctly identifies a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the minimum possible input values.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with the maximum possible input values.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
abcdefghijabcdefghij
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a moderate input size.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 20
abcdeabcdeabcde
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a moderate input size and checks if it correctly identifies all possible strings of length n that occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the length of s is equal to n and not all possible strings of length n can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ab
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the length of s is less than n and not all possible strings of length n can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of s.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
a
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the length of s is 0 and not all possible strings of length n can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets and occur as a subsequence of s.
