# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
This test case covers a basic scenario where there is only one pair of friends with a friendship value of 1. The teacher goes on 10 excursions, and each time the pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
This test case covers a scenario where there are two pairs of friends with different friendship values. The teacher goes on 4 excursions, and the expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there are no pairs of friends. The teacher goes on 24 excursions, but since there are no friends, the expected value of the sum of friendship values remains 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there is only one pair of friends and the teacher goes on only 1 excursion. The expected value of the sum of friendship values is simply the initial friendship value of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10^5 10^5 2*10^5
```
**Output**: 
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions are at their maximum limits. The expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated and then taken modulo (10^9+7) to ensure the result fits within the specified range.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10^9
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of excursions is at its maximum limit, and the friendship value is initially 1. The expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated and then taken modulo (10^9+7) to ensure the result fits within the specified range.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^5 0 2*10^5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there are no pairs of friends, and the teacher goes on the maximum number of excursions. The expected value of the sum of friendship values remains 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 10^9
```
**Output**: 
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the friendship value is initially at its maximum limit, and the teacher goes on 2 excursions. The expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated and then taken modulo (10^9+7) to ensure the result fits within the specified range.
