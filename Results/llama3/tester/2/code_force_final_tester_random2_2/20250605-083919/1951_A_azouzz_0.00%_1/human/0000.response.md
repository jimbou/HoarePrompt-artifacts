# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input string "10101" represents a configuration where lamps 1, 3, and 5 are turned on, and lamps 2 and 4 are turned off. The function should return "YES" because we can reach this configuration by turning on lamps 1 and 3, and then lamps 3 and 5.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string has two consecutive '1's. The function should return "NO" because we cannot turn on lamps 1 and 2 simultaneously.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string has three consecutive '1's. The function should return "NO" because we cannot turn on lamps 1, 2, and 3 simultaneously.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string has two consecutive '1's and the number of lamps is 2. The function should return "NO" because we cannot turn on lamps 1 and 2 simultaneously.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string has only one '1' and the number of lamps is 1. The function should return "NO" because we cannot turn on lamp 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string has only one '0' and the number of lamps is 1. The function should return "YES" because we can reach this configuration by not turning on any lamps.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string is empty. The function should return "YES" because we can reach this configuration by not turning on any lamps.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
5
10101
3
111
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the function with multiple test cases. The first test case is the same as Test 1, and the second test case is the same as Test 3. The function should return "YES" for the first test case and "NO" for the second test case.
