# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
24
```
**Output**: 
```
aav
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is 24, which can be decoded as "aav" (1 + 22 + 1 = 24).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
70
```
**Output**: 
```
rzz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs. The input is 70, which can be decoded as "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle the smallest possible input. The input is 3, which can only be decoded as "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
55
```
**Output**: 
```
czz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs that have multiple possible decodings. The input is 55, which can be decoded as "czz" (3 + 26 + 26 = 55) or "bzy" (2 + 25 + 28 = 55), but "czz" is the lexicographically smallest.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
48
```
**Output**: 
```
auz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle inputs that have multiple possible decodings. The input is 48, which can be decoded as "auz" (1 + 21 + 26 = 48) or "avx" (1 + 22 + 25 = 48), but "auz" is the lexicographically smallest.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
78
```
**Output**: 
```
zzz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle the largest possible input. The input is 78, which can only be decoded as "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input out of range
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs. The input is 0, which is outside the specified range of 3 to 78.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
79
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input out of range
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs. The input is 79, which is outside the specified range of 3 to 78.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input out of range
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs. The input is -1, which is outside the specified range of 3 to 78.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input is not an integer
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs. The input is "abc", which is not an integer.
