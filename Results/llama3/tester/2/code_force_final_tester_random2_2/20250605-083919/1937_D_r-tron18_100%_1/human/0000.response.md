# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3
> <<
```
**Output**:
```
3 6 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The pinball is placed on each cell, and the output should match the expected number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4
<<<<
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all characters are '<'. The pinball should move to the left, and the output should match the expected number of seconds.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
6
< > << >
```
**Output**:
```
1 4 7 10 8 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a more complex scenario with a mix of '<' and '>' characters. The pinball's movement should be correctly calculated, and the output should match the expected number of seconds.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
>
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the grid has only one cell. The pinball should leave the grid immediately, and the output should be 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
<
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the grid has only one cell and the character is '<'. The pinball should leave the grid immediately, and the output should be 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
>>>>>
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all characters are '>'. The pinball should move to the right, and the output should match the expected number of seconds.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
5
<<<<<
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all characters are '<'. The pinball should move to the left, and the output should match the expected number of seconds.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2
3
> <<
4
<<<<
```
**Output**:
```
3 6 5
1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple test cases. The code should correctly handle each test case separately and produce the expected output for each one.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
(no output)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the grid has zero cells. The code should not produce any output.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
(no output)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the grid has a negative number of cells. The code should not produce any output.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
100000
> <
```
**Output**:
```
(very large numbers)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has a large number of cells. The code should correctly handle this case and produce the expected output.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
100000
3
> <<
4
<<<<
...
```
**Output**:
```
(many outputs)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are a large number of test cases. The code should correctly handle each test case separately and produce the expected output for each one.
