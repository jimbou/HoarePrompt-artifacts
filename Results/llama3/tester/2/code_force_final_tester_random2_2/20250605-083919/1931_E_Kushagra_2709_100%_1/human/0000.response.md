# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the game. Anna reverses the integer 2, and Sasha concatenates the integers 2 and 14, resulting in 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the game when Anna has multiple options to reverse the integers. Anna reverses the integer 9, and Sasha concatenates the integers 9 and 56, resulting in 956, which is less than 10^5 = 100000.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Sasha has multiple options to concatenate the integers. Anna reverses the integer 1, and Sasha concatenates the integers 2007 and 800, resulting in 2007800, which is greater than 10^10 = 10000000000.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the game when Anna has multiple options to reverse the integers. Anna reverses the integer 5000, and Sasha concatenates the integers 5000 and 123, resulting in 5000123, which is greater than 10^5 = 100000.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when there are multiple integers with the same number of digits. Anna reverses the integer 6, and Sasha concatenates the integers 6 and 4, resulting in 64, which is less than 10^10 = 10000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the game when there is only one integer. Anna reverses the integer 6, and Sasha cannot make a move, resulting in Anna winning.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when there is only one integer and it is greater than or equal to 10^m. Anna reverses the integer 10, and Sasha wins since the resulting integer is greater than or equal to 10^1 = 10.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the game when there are multiple integers with the same number of digits. Anna reverses the integer 1, and Sasha concatenates the integers 1 and 2, resulting in 12, which is less than 10^9 = 1000000000.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when all integers have the same number of digits. Anna reverses the integer 10, and Sasha concatenates the integers 10 and 10, resulting in 1010, which is greater than 10^5 = 100000.
