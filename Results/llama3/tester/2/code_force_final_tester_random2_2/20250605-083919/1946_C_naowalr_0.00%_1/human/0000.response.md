# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 5 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edge between vertices 1 and 3 results in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 2 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing the edge between the two vertices results in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 6 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 3, as removing the edge between vertices 3 and 4 results in two connected components with at least 3 vertices each.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 3 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing the edge between vertices 1 and 2 results in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4

3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 8 vertices and 2 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, and between vertices 3 and 6 results in four connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 6 vertices and 2 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, and between vertices 4 and 5 results in three connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the tree has only 1 vertex and 0 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as there is only one connected component with 1 vertex.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the tree has 100000 vertices and 99999 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing all but one edge results in 99999 connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the tree has 100000 vertices and 0 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 100000, as there is only one connected component with 100000 vertices.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Cannot remove 1 edge from a tree with only 1 vertex
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the tree has only 1 vertex and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is an error message, as it is not possible to remove an edge from a tree with only 1 vertex.
