**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It includes four test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The first test case has an array of length 4, the second test case has an array of length 5, the third test case has an array of length 6, and the fourth test case has an array of length 1.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
L
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element. The program should output 0 because the product of a single element is the element itself, and the remainder of 1 divided by 1 is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```

R
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element and the remainder is 0. The program should output 0 because the product of a single element is the element itself, and the remainder of 10 divided by 10 is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 10
1 1
LR
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has two elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 because the product of the two elements is 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```

2 10
10 1
RL
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has two elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 because the product of the two elements is 10, and the remainder of 10 divided by 10 is 0, but after removing the last element, the product becomes 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```

1 1 1
LLL
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 1 because the product of the three elements is 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
3 10
1 1 1
RRR
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 1 because the product of the three elements is 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```

LRL
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 1 because the product of the three elements is 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```

1 1 1
RLR
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements and the remainder is 1. The program should output 1 1 1 because the product of the three elements is 1, and the remainder of 1 divided by 10 is 1.
