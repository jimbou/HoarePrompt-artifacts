# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the median is not the smallest element. The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the second and third elements to 4, the median becomes 4, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains a single element. The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing it to 1000000001, the median becomes 1000000001, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the median is not the smallest element and there are multiple elements with the same value as the median. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the median is not the smallest element and there are multiple elements with the same value as the median. The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements to 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains only two elements. The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains only two elements with the same value. The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains only elements with the same value. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array is empty. The median of an empty array is undefined, so the function should return 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains the maximum possible integer value. The median of the array [2147483647] is 2147483647. By increasing it to 2147483648, the median becomes 2147483648, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
-2147483648
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains the minimum possible integer value. The median of the array [-2147483648] is -2147483648. By increasing it to -2147483647, the median becomes -2147483647, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains a large number of elements with the same value. The median of the array [1, 1, ..., 1] is 1. By increasing the first element to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains a large number of elements with the same value and the value is the maximum possible integer. The median of the array [1000000000, 1000000000, ..., 1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the first element to 1000000001, the median becomes 1000000001, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
-1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input array contains a large number of elements with the same value and the value is the minimum possible integer. The median of the array [-1000000000, -1000000000, ..., -1000000000] is -1000000000. By increasing the first element to -1000000001, the median becomes -1000000001, which is greater than the original median.
