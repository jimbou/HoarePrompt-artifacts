# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = 3. The expected output is 2, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of 3 sub-problems.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is equal to n. In this case, the only possible way to break up the problem is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, resulting in a balance of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
420 69
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is a large number and n is also a large number. The expected output is 6, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 420 into a problemset of 69 sub-problems.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is equal to 1 and n is also equal to 1. In this case, the only possible way to break up the problem is to have a single sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, resulting in a balance of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is equal to 1. In this case, the only possible way to break up the problem is to have a single sub-problem with a difficulty equal to x, resulting in a balance equal to x.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is equal to n. In this case, the only possible way to break up the problem is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, resulting in a balance of 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: x cannot be 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is equal to 0. This is an invalid input, and the function should return an error message.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: n cannot be 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is equal to 0. This is an invalid input, and the function should return an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: x cannot be negative
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is a negative number. This is an invalid input, and the function should return an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 -3
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: n cannot be negative
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is a negative number. This is an invalid input, and the function should return an error message.
