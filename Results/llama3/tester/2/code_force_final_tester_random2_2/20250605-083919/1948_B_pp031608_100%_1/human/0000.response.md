# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function. It includes three test cases, each with a different input array. The first test case has an array that can be sorted by splitting the first element, the second test case has an array that cannot be sorted, and the third test case has an array that is already sorted.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and the first element is 10. The function should be able to split the first element and sort the array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array is already sorted. The function should return YES without modifying the array.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array is in reverse order. The function should return NO because it is not possible to sort the array by splitting elements.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element, and that element is 10. The function should be able to split the element and return YES.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element, and that element is 0. The function should return YES because the array is already sorted.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has two elements, and the second element is 10. The function should be able to split the second element and sort the array.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has two elements, and the first element is 10. The function should be able to split the first element and sort the array.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements, and the second element is 10. The function should be able to split the second element and sort the array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has three elements, and the first element is 10. The function should be able to split the first element and sort the array.
