# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case covers a basic scenario where the desired configuration has an odd number of lamps turned on, which is achievable by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case covers a basic scenario where the desired configuration has an even number of lamps turned on, but they are adjacent, which is not achievable by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there is only one lamp, and it is turned on. Since we can't turn on two non-adjacent lamps, this configuration is not achievable.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there are only two lamps, and both are turned on. Since they are adjacent, this configuration is not achievable by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
10101010101010101010101010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case covers a large input scenario where the desired configuration has an alternating pattern of turned-on and turned-off lamps. This is achievable by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case covers a large input scenario where the desired configuration has all lamps turned off. This is achievable by not performing any operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
11111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case covers a large input scenario where the desired configuration has all lamps turned on. Since we can't turn on two non-adjacent lamps to achieve this, this configuration is not achievable.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where there are no lamps. This is considered an achievable configuration since there are no lamps to turn on.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Invalid input
```
This test case covers an invalid input scenario where the number of lamps is negative. This should result in an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
Invalid input
```
This test case covers an invalid input scenario where the number of lamps is a non-numeric character. This should result in an error message.
