# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when both n and m are equal to 1. In this case, there are no valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n and m are small. In this case, the only valid pair is (2, 2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are relatively small. In this case, the only valid pair is (3, 3).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when n and m are moderate in size. In this case, the valid pairs are (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are larger. In this case, there are 423 valid pairs.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when n and m are very large. In this case, there are 5933961 valid pairs.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when m is the maximum possible value (2^31 - 1). In this case, there are no valid pairs.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
2147483647 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when n is the maximum possible value (2^31 - 1). In this case, there are no valid pairs.

# Test 9 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are 0. In this case, the function should raise an error or exception since the input values are invalid.

# Test 10 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when both n and m are negative. In this case, the function should raise an error or exception since the input values are invalid.
