# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a simple scenario where Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 2. The function should return 4, which are the possible values of k (2, 3, 5, 6).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 1. The function should return 1, which is the only possible value of k (2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs. The input is a scenario where Vasya's position is 76 and the number he received is 4. The function should return 9, which are the possible values of k.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 100 and the number he received is 99. The function should return 0, as there are no possible values of k.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle very large inputs. The input is a scenario where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 500 million. The function should return 1, which is the only possible value of k.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1 and the number he received is 1. The function should return 0, as there are no possible values of k.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 1. The function should return 1, which is the only possible value of k (2).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 1. The function should return 0, as there are no possible values of k.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 999 million. The function should return 0, as there are no possible values of k.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1 billion and the number he received is 1 billion. The function should return 0, as there are no possible values of k.
