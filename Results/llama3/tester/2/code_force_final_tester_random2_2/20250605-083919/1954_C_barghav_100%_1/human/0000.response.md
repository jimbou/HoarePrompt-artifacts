# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
73
31
```
**Output**: 
```
71
33
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where the input numbers have different digits at the same position, and swapping them results in a larger product.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2
```
This test case covers the scenario where the input numbers have different digits at the same position, but swapping them does not result in a larger product.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3516
3982
```
**Output**: 
```
3912
3586
```
This test case covers the scenario where the input numbers have multiple digits and swapping them results in a larger product.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
111
111
```
**Output**: 
```
111
111
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are identical, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
123456789
987654321
```
**Output**: 
```
987654321
123456789
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers have a large number of digits and swapping them results in a larger product.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
9
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are single-digit and identical, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
123
321
```
**Output**: 
```
321
123
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers have a small number of digits and swapping them results in a larger product.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
999
999
```
**Output**: 
```
999
999
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are identical and consist of only 9's, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100
100
```
**Output**: 
```
100
100
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are identical and consist of only 1's and 0's, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 10
