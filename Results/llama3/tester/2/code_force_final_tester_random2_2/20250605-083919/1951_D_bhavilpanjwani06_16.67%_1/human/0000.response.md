# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
2
```
This test case verifies that the function can handle a simple scenario where Alice has 7 coins and Bob wants her to buy 3 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 2, allowing Alice to buy 3 jewels and spend all her coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins. The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy exactly 4 jewels.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
This test case verifies that the function can handle a scenario where Alice has a large number of coins (255) and Bob wants her to buy 8 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up 8 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy 1 jewel. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy 1 jewel.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case verifies that the function can handle a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels (10^18). The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy 10^18 jewels.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
10^18
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy only 1 jewel. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 10^18, allowing Alice to buy 1 jewel.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels (10^18). The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy 10^18 jewels with only 1 coin.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 10^18-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
2
1 10^18-1
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels minus 1 (10^18-1). The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up 2 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 10^18-1 jewels.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 10^18+1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy more jewels than the maximum possible number (10^18+1). The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy more than 10^18 jewels.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has 0 coins and Bob wants her to buy 1 jewel. The expected output is "NO" because Alice cannot buy any jewels with 0 coins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
0
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has 0 coins and Bob wants her to buy 0 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up 0 stalls, allowing Alice to buy 0 jewels.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
0
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins (10^18) and Bob wants her to buy 0 jewels. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up 0 stalls, allowing Alice to buy 0 jewels.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10^18+1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy more jewels than the maximum possible number (10^18+1). The expected output is "NO" because no matter how Bob sets up the stalls, Alice will not be able to buy more than 10^18 jewels.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18+1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
10^18+1
```
This test case checks that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has more coins than the maximum possible number (10^18+1) and Bob wants her to buy 1 jewel. The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 10^18+1, allowing Alice to buy 1 jewel.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18+1 10^18+1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where Alice has more coins than the maximum possible number (10^18+1) and Bob wants her to buy the maximum possible number of jewels plus 1 (10^18+1). The expected output is "YES" because Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy 10^18+1 jewels.

Note: The above test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the function's correctness and robustness.
