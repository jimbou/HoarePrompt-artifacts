# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 5 and there are 4 queries. The queries cover different subarrays, including the entire array, a single element, and a subarray with a mix of small and large numbers.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has only one element. In this case, the subarray is not good because there is no other element to swap with.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has only two elements, both of which are 1. In this case, the subarray is not good because there is no way to make the sum of the subarray equal to the sum of the original array without using the same elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 3 and there is 1 query. The query covers the entire array, which is good because the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the original array and all elements in the subarray are greater than 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4
1 4
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 4 and there are 2 queries. The queries cover different subarrays, including the entire array and a subarray with a mix of small and large numbers.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
2 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
NO
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has a length of 5 and all elements are 1. In this case, none of the subarrays are good because there is no way to make the sum of the subarray equal to the sum of the original array without using the same elements.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 6
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 6 and there are 2 queries. The queries cover different subarrays, including the entire array and a subarray with a mix of small and large numbers.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 7 and there is 1 query. The query covers the entire array, which is good because the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the original array and all elements in the subarray are greater than 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 8
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 8 and there are 2 queries. The queries cover different subarrays, including the entire array and a subarray with a mix of small and large numbers.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 9
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 9 and there is 1 query. The query covers the entire array, which is good because the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the original array and all elements in the subarray are greater than 0.
