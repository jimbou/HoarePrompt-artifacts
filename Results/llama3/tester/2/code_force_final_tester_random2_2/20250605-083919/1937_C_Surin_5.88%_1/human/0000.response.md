# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It tests the program with two different inputs, one with n=4 and another with n=2. The program should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where n=2. The program should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where n=1. The program should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2
4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
? 0 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 0 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the program needs to ask more than 3n queries to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where n is large (n=10000). The program should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized within the allowed number of queries (3n).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where n is large (n=10000) and the program needs to ask the maximum allowed number of queries (3n) to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where n is large (n=10000) and the program needs to ask more than the maximum allowed number of queries (3n) to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program should terminate immediately and return a Wrong Answer verdict.
