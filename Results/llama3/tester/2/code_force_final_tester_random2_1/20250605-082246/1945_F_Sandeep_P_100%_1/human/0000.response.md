# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
16 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array `v` has three elements, and the permutation `p` is also of length three. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
9 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the permutation `p` is the same as the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
8 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the permutation `p` is the reverse of the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
5
1 4 6 10 10
2 1 4 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there are duplicate elements in the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
4
2 2 5 5
4 2 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
5 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there are duplicate elements in the input array `v` and the permutation `p`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
5
1 2 9 10 10
1 4 2 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there are duplicate elements in the input array `v` and the permutation `p`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array `v` has only one element. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array `v` has two elements and the permutation `p` is the same as the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array `v` has two elements and the permutation `p` is the reverse of the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
200000
1 1 1 ... 1
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
200000 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array `v` has a large number of elements and the permutation `p` is the same as the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
200000
1 1 1 ... 1
200000 199999 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
200000 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array `v` has a large number of elements and the permutation `p` is the reverse of the input array `v`. The function should return the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.
