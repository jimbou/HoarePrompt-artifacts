# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input contains four numbers, and the function should return 4 because each number has a unique binary representation.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where two numbers have complementary binary representations. The function should return 1 because these two numbers can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input size. The function should return 3 because there are three groups of numbers with unique binary representations.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a smaller input size. The function should return 2 because there are two groups of numbers with unique binary representations.

```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a mix of small and large numbers. The function should return 2 because there are two groups of numbers with unique binary representations.

0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where there are duplicate numbers. The function should return 2 because there are two groups of numbers with unique binary representations.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where there are duplicate numbers. The function should return 2 because there are two groups of numbers with unique binary representations.
