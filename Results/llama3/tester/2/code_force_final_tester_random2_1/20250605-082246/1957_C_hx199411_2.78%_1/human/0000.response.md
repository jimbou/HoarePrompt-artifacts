# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It's a 4x4 chessboard with one move already played (1, 2). The code should output 3, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**: 
```
331
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a larger chessboard (8x8) with one move already played (7, 6). The code should output 331, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**: 
```
671968183
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a very large chessboard (1000x1000) with four moves already played. The code should output 671968183, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a 1x1 chessboard with no moves already played. The code should output 1, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a 2x2 chessboard with two moves already played, where the second move is the mirror of the first move. The code should output 1, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a 3x3 chessboard with three moves already played, where each move is on the diagonal. The code should output 1, which is the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
(modulo 10^9+7)
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a very large chessboard (1000000x1000000) with no moves already played. The code should output the number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle an invalid input (0x0 chessboard). The code should output an error or throw an exception.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle an invalid input (negative size chessboard). The code should output an error or throw an exception.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle an invalid input (negative number of moves). The code should output an error or throw an exception.
