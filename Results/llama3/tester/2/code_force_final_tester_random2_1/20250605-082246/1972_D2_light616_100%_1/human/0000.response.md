# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a simple input. The function should return 0 because there are no pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle small inputs. The function should return 1 because there is one pair (2, 2) that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle slightly larger inputs. The function should return 1 because there is one pair (3, 3) that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs. The function should return 6 because there are six pairs (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8) that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large inputs. The function should return 423 because there are 423 pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle very large inputs. The function should return 5933961 because there are 5933961 pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle an input where one of the numbers is very large and the other is very small. The function should return 0 because there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle an input where one of the numbers is very large and the other is very small. The function should return 0 because there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle an input where both numbers are very large. The function should return 5933961 because there are 5933961 pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases. The function should return 0 for both test cases because there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.
