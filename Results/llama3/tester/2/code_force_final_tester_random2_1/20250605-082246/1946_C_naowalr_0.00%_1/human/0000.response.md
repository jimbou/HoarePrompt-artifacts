# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the tree has 5 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edge between vertices 1 and 3 will result in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the tree has only 2 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing the edge between the two vertices will result in two connected components with at least 1 vertex each.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the tree has 6 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 3, as removing the edge between vertices 3 and 4 will result in two connected components with at least 3 vertices each.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the tree has 3 vertices and 1 edge needs to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing any edge will result in two connected components with at least 1 vertex each.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the tree has 8 vertices and 2 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing any two edges will result in two connected components with at least 1 vertex each.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the tree has 6 vertices and 2 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, and between vertices 4 and 5 will result in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where the tree has only 1 vertex and no edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as there is only one connected component with 1 vertex.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
1
100000 99999
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where the tree has 100000 vertices and 99999 edges need to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing almost all edges will result in many connected components with at least 1 vertex each.

# Test 9 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where the tree has 100000 vertices and no edges need to be removed. The expected output is 100000, as there is only one connected component with 100000 vertices.
