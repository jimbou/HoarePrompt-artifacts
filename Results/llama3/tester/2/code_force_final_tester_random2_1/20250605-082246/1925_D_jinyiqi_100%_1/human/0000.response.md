# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
100 0 24
2 1 10
1 2 1
3 1 2
2 1 1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**:
```
0
55
777777784
40000020
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the code. It includes four test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The first test case has no pairs of friends, so the expected output is 0. The second test case has one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1, and the expected output is the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1+2+3+...+10 = 55). The third test case has two pairs of friends with initial friendship values of 25 and 24, and the expected output is the sum of the first 4 natural numbers multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends (7/9). The fourth test case has two pairs of friends with initial friendship values of 25 and 24, and the expected output is the sum of the first 4 natural numbers multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends (40000020).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one pair of friends and only one excursion. The expected output is the initial friendship value of the pair (1).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no pairs of friends and only one excursion. The expected output is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
100000 100000 200000
```
**Output**:
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions are at their maximum limits. The expected output is a very large number.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 200000
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of excursions is at its maximum limit and there is only one pair of friends. The expected output is a very large number.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
100000 0 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no pairs of friends and the number of excursions is at its maximum limit. The expected output is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the initial friendship value of the pair is 0. The expected output is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the initial friendship value of the pair is at its maximum limit. The expected output is the initial friendship value (1000000000).
