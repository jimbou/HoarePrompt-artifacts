# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where there are constraints of all three types, and the answer is a positive integer.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the constraints are contradictory (k >= 5 and k <= 4), resulting in no possible integers satisfying all constraints.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
This test case covers a more complex scenario with multiple constraints of each type, including some that are redundant or overlapping.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers another edge scenario where the constraints are contradictory (k >= 9 and k <= 2), resulting in no possible integers satisfying all constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers a scenario where all possible integers are excluded by the constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
This test case covers a scenario with very large numbers and a mix of constraint types.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 1
2 2
3 1
4
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
This test case covers multiple test cases in a single input, with the first test case having a simple constraint and the second test case having contradictory constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers a scenario where the constraints are equal (k >= 1 and k <= 1), resulting in only one possible integer satisfying all constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers a scenario where the constraints are equal (k >= 0 and k <= 0), resulting in only one possible integer satisfying all constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers a scenario with only one constraint, resulting in only one possible integer satisfying all constraints.
