# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the basic functionality of the function when the number of buns (n) is less than the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). The expected output is 17, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 4 buns.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of buns (n) is equal to the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). The expected output is 35, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 5 buns.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of buns (n) is greater than the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). The expected output is 100, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 10 buns.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b) is greater than the number of buns (n). The expected output is 45, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 5 buns.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with large input values. The expected output is 1000000000000000000, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 1000000000 buns.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with large input values and a small price for the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). The expected output is 1000000000000000000, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 1000000000 buns.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior with a large number of buns (n) and a small usual price of a bun (a). The expected output is 500500, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 1000 buns.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with zero buns (n). The expected output is 0, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling no buns.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a zero usual price of a bun (a). The expected output is 0, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns at zero price.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior with a zero price for the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). The expected output is 100, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all 10 buns at the usual price.
