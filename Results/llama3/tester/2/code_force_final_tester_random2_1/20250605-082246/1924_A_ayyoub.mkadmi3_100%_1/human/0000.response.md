# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aa
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abb". Since "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb", it prints "NO" and the string "aa".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
ccc
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "aabbccabab". Since "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab", it prints "NO" and the string "ccc".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 26 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Since there are 26! possible strings, it is not possible for all of them to occur as subsequences of a string of length 26.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0 26 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Since there is only one possible string of length 0 (the empty string), it occurs as a subsequence of any string.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
26 0 26
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 0 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Since there are no lowercase English alphabets, there are no possible strings, and the function should return "YES".

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of an empty string. Since there are no characters in the string, no strings can occur as subsequences, and the function should return "NO".
