# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the functionality when the median is not the smallest element in the array. The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the second and third elements to 4, the median becomes 4, which is greater than the original median. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the functionality when the array contains only one element. The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the element to 1000000001, the median becomes 1000000001, which is greater than the original median. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case checks the functionality when the median is the same as the majority of the elements in the array. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median. This requires 3 operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the functionality when the median is not the same as the majority of the elements in the array. The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements to 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the functionality when the array contains only two elements. The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the functionality when the array contains two identical elements. The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case checks the functionality when the array contains all identical elements. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median. This requires 3 operations.
