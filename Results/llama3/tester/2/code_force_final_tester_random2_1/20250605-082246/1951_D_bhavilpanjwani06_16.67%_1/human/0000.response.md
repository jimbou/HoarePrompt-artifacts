# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. Alice has 7 coins and wants to buy 3 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 1 stall with a price of 2, allowing Alice to buy 3 jewels.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels. Alice has 6 coins and wants to buy 4 jewels, but no combination of stall prices can achieve this.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a larger input. Alice has 255 coins and wants to buy 8 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 8 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Alice has only 1 coin and wants to buy 1 jewel. The code should output "YES" and set up 1 stall with a price of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a very large input. Alice has 10^18 coins and wants to buy 10^18 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 1 stall with a price of 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
2
2 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a moderate input. Alice has 10 coins and wants to buy 5 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 5 jewels.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Alice has 0 coins and wants to buy 1 jewel. The code should output "NO" because it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 1 jewel with 0 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Alice has 1 coin and wants to buy 0 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 0 stalls because Alice does not need to buy any jewels.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a moderate input. Alice has 10 coins and wants to buy 10 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 1 stall with a price of 1.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000000000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Alice has 10^18 coins and wants to buy 0 jewels. The code should output "YES" and set up 0 stalls because Alice does not need to buy any jewels.
