# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the basic scenario where n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is an array with two elements, both being 1, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**:
```
69420 69 420
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the scenario where n = 3 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with three elements, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where n = 3 and k = 2. Since it is not possible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length 3, the expected output is -1.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the edge case where n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with a single element, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where n = 10 and k = 10. The expected output is an array with ten elements, all being 1, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the scenario where n = 10 and k = 5. Since it is not possible to have exactly 5 sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length 10, the expected output is -1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000 1000
```
**Output**:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (1000 times)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where n = 1000 and k = 1000. The expected output is an array with 1000 elements, all being 1, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000 500
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the scenario where n = 1000 and k = 500. Since it is not possible to have exactly 500 sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length 1000, the expected output is -1.
