# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships a large number of times, but the total durability of the ships is small.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 7
5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships a large number of times, and the total durability of the ships is moderate.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the scenario where there is only one ship.

```
1
1 1000000000000000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ship a very large number of times.
