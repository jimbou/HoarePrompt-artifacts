# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It should return 4, as there are 4 possible values of k (2, 3, 5, 6) that fit the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is small. It should return 1, as there is only 1 possible value of k (2) that fits the given constraints.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a larger input. It should return 9, as there are 9 possible values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is close to n. It should return 0, as there are no possible values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is very large. It should return 1, as there is only 1 possible value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 1. It should return 0, as there are no possible values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 2. It should return 1, as there is only 1 possible value of k (2) that fits the given constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is equal to n. It should return 0, as there are no possible values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is 0. It should return 0, as there are no possible values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 0. It should return 0, as there are no possible values of k that fit the given constraints.
