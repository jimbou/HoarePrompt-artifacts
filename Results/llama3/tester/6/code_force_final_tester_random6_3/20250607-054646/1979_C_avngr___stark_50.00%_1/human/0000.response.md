# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**:
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of outcomes is 2 and both multipliers are 3. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all multipliers are the same (5). In this case, it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**:
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario with a larger number of outcomes (6) and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where one of the multipliers is less than 3. In this case, it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**:
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario with a moderate number of outcomes (5) and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there is only one outcome. In this case, the expected output is a single coin bet.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of outcomes is the maximum allowed (50) and all multipliers are the minimum allowed (2). In this case, it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of outcomes is the maximum allowed (50) and all multipliers are the maximum allowed (20). In this case, it's impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.
