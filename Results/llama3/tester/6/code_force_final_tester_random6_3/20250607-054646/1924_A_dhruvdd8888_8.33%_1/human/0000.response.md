# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the given string "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the given string "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb". The second line of the output is "aa", which is a string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', and 'c') occur as a subsequence of the given string "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab". The second line of the output is "ccc", which is a string of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("a") is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
b
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". The expected output is "NO" because the string "b" is not a subsequence of "a". The second line of the output is "b", which is a string of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "a".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 2
aa
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the given string "aa". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("aa") is a subsequence of "aa".

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 2
ab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
bb
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the given string "ab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "bb" is not a subsequence of "ab". The second line of the output is "bb", which is a string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "ab".

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 3
abc
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', and 'c') occur as a subsequence of the given string "abc". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aaa" is not a subsequence of "abc". The second line of the output is "aaa", which is a string of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "abc".

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 4 4
abcd
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aaaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 4 that can be formed using the first 4 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c', and 'd') occur as a subsequence of the given string "abcd". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aaaa" is not a subsequence of "abcd". The second line of the output is "aaaa", which is a string of length 4 that can be formed using the first 4 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "abcd".

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
5 5 5
abcde
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aaaaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 5 that can be formed using the first 5 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e') occur as a subsequence of the given string "abcde". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aaaaa" is not a subsequence of "abcde". The second line of the output is "aaaaa", which is a string of length 5 that can be formed using the first 5 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "abcde".
