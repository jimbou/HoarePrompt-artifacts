```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is a single character 'a' as it is the only possible string of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is a string 'aa' as it is the only possible string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is a string 'baab' as it contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbac
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is a string 'abcbac' as it contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 26. The expected output is a string containing all 26 lowercase English alphabets as it is the only possible string of length 1 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
26 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 26 and k = 1. The expected output is a string containing 26 'a's as it is the only possible string of length 26 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 26 and k = 26. The expected output is a string containing all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(Empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 0 and k = 1. The expected output is an empty string as there are no possible strings of length 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
(Empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 0. The expected output is an empty string as there are no possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using 0 lowercase English alphabets.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
(Empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 0 and k = 0. The expected output is an empty string as there are no possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using 0 lowercase English alphabets.
