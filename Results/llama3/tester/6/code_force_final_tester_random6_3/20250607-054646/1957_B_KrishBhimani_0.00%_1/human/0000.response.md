# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 1 and k = 5. The expected output is a single integer 5, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
2
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is a sequence of two integers, 1 and 2, which sum up to 3 and have two 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
5
```
**Output**:
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 5. The expected output is a sequence of two integers, 5 and 0, which sum up to 5 and have two 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
6
51
```
**Output**:
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 6 and k = 51. The expected output is a sequence of six integers, 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, and 12, which sum up to 51 and have five 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is a single integer 1, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 0. The expected output is a single integer 0, which satisfies the conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
2
1
```
**Output**:
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is a sequence of two integers, 1 and 0, which sum up to 1 and have one 1 in their binary representation.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2
0
```
**Output**:
```
0 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 0. The expected output is a sequence of two integers, 0 and 0, which sum up to 0 and have no 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
100000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
// A sequence of 100000 integers that sum up to 1000000000 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is large (100000) and k is also large (1000000000). The expected output is a sequence of 100000 integers that sum up to 1000000000 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
200000
1
```
**Output**:
```
// A sequence of 200000 integers that sum up to 1 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n is large (200000) and k is small (1). The expected output is a sequence of 200000 integers that sum up to 1 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.
