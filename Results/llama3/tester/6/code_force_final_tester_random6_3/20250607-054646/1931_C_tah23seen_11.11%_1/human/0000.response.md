# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The array has 6 elements, and the function should return 4, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all elements in the array are already equal. The function should return 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple segments of equal elements. The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has only one element. The function should return 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has only two elements. The function should return 1, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has three distinct elements. The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has multiple segments of equal elements and some single-element segments. The function should return 6, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has multiple segments of equal elements and some single-element segments. The function should return 7, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has a large number of elements. The function should return 199999, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has a large number of equal elements. The function should return 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 1 2 ... 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has a large number of alternating elements. The function should return 100000, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has a large number of equal elements and a single different element at the end. The function should return 199999, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.
