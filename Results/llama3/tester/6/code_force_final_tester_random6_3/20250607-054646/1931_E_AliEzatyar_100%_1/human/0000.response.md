# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Anna has two options to reverse the digits of either 14 or 2. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has three options to reverse the digits of 9, 56, or 1. If she reverses 9, Sasha can concatenate 65 and 1 to form 651, which is less than 10^5. If she reverses 56, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 1 to form 91, which is also less than 10^5. If she reverses 1, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 65 to form 965, which is still less than 10^5. Therefore, Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Sasha has four options to concatenate two numbers. Regardless of Anna's move, Sasha can always find a way to concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^10.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has four options to reverse the digits of 5000, 123, 30, or 4. If she reverses 5000, Sasha can concatenate 321 and 4 to form 4321, which is greater than 10^5. If she reverses 123, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 4 to form 50004, which is also greater than 10^5. If she reverses 30, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 123 to form 5000123, which is still greater than 10^5. If she reverses 4, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 321 to form 5000321, which is also greater than 10^5. Therefore, Sasha wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has ten options to reverse the digits of any number. Regardless of Sasha's move, Anna can always find a way to reverse a number to make the remaining number less than 10^10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has only one option to reverse the digits of 6. Since the resulting number 6 is less than 10^1, Anna wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has only one option to reverse the digits of 10. Since the resulting number 01 is less than 10^1, Anna wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has eight options to reverse the digits of any number. Regardless of Sasha's move, Anna can always find a way to reverse a number to make the remaining number less than 10^9.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Sasha has four options to concatenate two numbers. Regardless of Anna's move, Sasha can always find a way to concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^5.
