**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It includes three test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The first test case has 4 vertices, the second has 4 vertices, and the third has 2 vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
! 2 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 2. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
? 1
? 0
! 3 2 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 3. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 99999
? 99998
...
? 1
! 100000 ... 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 100000. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
! 2 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 2 and there are no removed edges. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
? 1
? 0
! 3 2 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 3 and there are two removed edges. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1

...
99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 99999
? 99998
...
? 1
! 100000 ... 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the number of vertices is 100000 and there are 99999 removed edges. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.
