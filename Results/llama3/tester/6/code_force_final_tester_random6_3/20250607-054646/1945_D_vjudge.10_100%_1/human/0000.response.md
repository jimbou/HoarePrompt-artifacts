**2. Edge Test Cases**

# Test 5
**Input**:
```

1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there is only 1 person in the queue, and Kirill needs to reach the first position (which is already occupied by himself).

# Test 6

[1] * 200000
[1] * 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the queue is extremely large (200,000 people), and Kirill needs to reach the first 200,000 positions (i.e., the entire queue).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
4 4
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**:
```
