# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The chessboard is 4x4, and one move has been made. The code should calculate the number of possible final configurations after this move.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle larger chessboards and different move positions.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large chessboards and multiple moves.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there are no moves made.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when all possible moves have been made.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when all possible moves have been made on a larger chessboard.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000 1000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard is very large and all possible moves have been made.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard size is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
-1 0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid chessboard size
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the chessboard size is negative.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 -1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid number of moves
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of moves is negative.
