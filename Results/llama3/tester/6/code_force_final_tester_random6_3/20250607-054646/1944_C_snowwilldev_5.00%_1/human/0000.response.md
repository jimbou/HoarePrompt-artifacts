# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, and Bob chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is already sorted. Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 2, and Bob chooses the element 3. The final array c is [0, 2], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only one element. Alice chooses the element 1, and Bob has no choice but to choose the same element 1. The final array c is [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only one element, which is 0. Alice chooses the element 0, and the game ends. The final array c is [0], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of the same element. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the remaining element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of different elements. Alice chooses the element 2, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 1, and Bob chooses the remaining element 2. The final array c is [2, 0, 1], which has a MEX of 3.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 0 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of the same element and a single occurrence of another element. Alice chooses the element 2, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the remaining element 1, and Alice chooses the remaining element 0. The final array c is [2, 0, 1, 0], which has a MEX of 3.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of the same element and multiple occurrences of another element. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the remaining element 1, Alice chooses the remaining element 0, and Bob chooses the remaining element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 1, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of the same element and multiple occurrences of another element, with the first element having more occurrences. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the remaining element 1, Alice chooses the remaining element 0, Bob chooses the remaining element 0, and Alice chooses the remaining element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has multiple occurrences of the same element and multiple occurrences of another element, with the first element having more occurrences. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the remaining element 1, Alice chooses the remaining element 0, Bob chooses the remaining element 0, Alice chooses the remaining element 0, and Bob chooses the remaining element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.
