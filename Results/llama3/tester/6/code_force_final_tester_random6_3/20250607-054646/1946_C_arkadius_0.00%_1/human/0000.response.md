# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The tree has 5 vertices and 1 edge to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edge between vertices 1 and 3 results in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 2 vertices and 1 edge to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing the edge between the two vertices results in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a linear structure. The expected output is 3, as removing the edge between vertices 3 and 4 results in two connected components with at least 3 vertices each.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 3 vertices and 1 edge to be removed. The expected output is 1, as removing any edge results in two connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a star structure. The expected output is 1, as removing any two edges results in multiple connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a complex structure. The expected output is 2, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, and between vertices 4 and 5 results in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 1 vertex and 0 edges to be removed. The expected output is 1, as there are no edges to remove.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has 0 vertices and 0 edges to be removed. The expected output is 0, as there are no vertices or edges.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
4 6
5 7
6 8
7 9
8 10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a large number of vertices and edges to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, between vertices 1 and 3, between vertices 2 and 4, between vertices 3 and 5, and between vertices 4 and 6 results in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100 50
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
...
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a very large number of vertices and edges to be removed. The expected output is 2, as removing the edges between vertices 1 and 2, between vertices 1 and 3, and so on, results in two connected components with at least 2 vertices each.
