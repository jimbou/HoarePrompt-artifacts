# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a simple scenario where the array has three elements and x is 1. The expected output is 2, as we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 3] with XOR values 1 and 2 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 1, which is less than or equal to x.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle a scenario where the array has two elements and x is 2. The expected output is 2, as we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 2] with XOR values 1 and 1 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 1, which is less than or equal to x.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where the array has two elements and x is 2. The expected output is 1, as we cannot divide the array into two segments with XOR values that have a bitwise OR less than or equal to x.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 3
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle a scenario where the array has two elements and x is 3. The expected output is 2, as we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 2] with XOR values 0 and 0 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 0, which is less than or equal to x.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3 2
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where the array has three elements and x is 2. The expected output is 3, as we can divide the array into three segments [1, 1], [2, 2], and [3, 3] with XOR values 0, 0, and 1 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 1, which is less than or equal to x.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
4 2
1 3 3 7
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle a scenario where the array has four elements and x is 2. The expected output is -1, as we cannot divide the array into segments with XOR values that have a bitwise OR less than or equal to x.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a scenario where the array has two elements and x is 2. The expected output is 1, as we cannot divide the array into two segments with XOR values that have a bitwise OR less than or equal to x.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5 0
0 1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can handle a scenario where the array has five elements and x is 0. The expected output is 2, as we can divide the array into two segments [1, 3] and [4, 5] with XOR values 3 and 3 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 3, which is not less than or equal to x, but we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 5] with XOR values 0 and 6 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 6, which is not less than or equal to x, but we can divide the array into two segments [1, 2] and [3, 5] with XOR values 3 and 4 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 7, which is not less than or equal to x, but we can divide the array into two segments [1, 4] and [2, 5] with XOR values 6 and 2 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 6, which is not less than or equal to x, but we can divide the array into two segments [1, 5] and [2, 4] with XOR values 6 and 6 respectively, and their bitwise OR is 6, which is not less than or equal to x.
