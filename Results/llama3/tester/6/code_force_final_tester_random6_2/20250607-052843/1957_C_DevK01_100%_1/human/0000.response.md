# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With a 4x4 chessboard and one move already played (1, 2), the code should output 3, which represents the three possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle larger chessboards and different move positions. With an 8x8 chessboard and one move already played (7, 6), the code should output 331, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large chessboards and multiple moves. With a 1000x1000 chessboard and four moves already played, the code should output 671968183, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle edge cases, specifically when the chessboard size is 1x1 and no moves have been played. The code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle edge cases, specifically when the chessboard size is 3x3 and three moves have been played, resulting in a situation where no more moves are possible. The code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle edge cases, specifically when the chessboard size is 2x2 and one move has been played, resulting in a situation where no more moves are possible. The code should output 1, which represents the only possible final configuration.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle very large chessboards. The code should output a very large number, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle invalid input, specifically when the chessboard size is 0x0. The code should output an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
-1 0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle invalid input, specifically when the chessboard size is negative. The code should output an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 -1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle invalid input, specifically when the number of moves is negative. The code should output an error message.
