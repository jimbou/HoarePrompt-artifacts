# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input is a small number. The expected output is an array with a single element, which is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a slightly larger number. The expected output is an array with three elements, which are 0, 1, and 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a moderate-sized number. The expected output is an array with five elements, which are 2, 2, 3, 4, and 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a large number. The expected output is an array with seven elements, which are -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, and -1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 1, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a negative number, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a very large number that exceeds the limit specified in the problem statement. The expected output is -1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there are multiple test cases. The expected output is two arrays, one with a single element 0, and the other with three elements 0, 1, and 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there are a large number of test cases. The expected output is an array with a single element 0, repeated 1000 times.
