```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It's a simple tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges. The stone is initially placed on node 3, which is a leaf node. Ron makes the first move, and since there's only one possible move (to node 1), he wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the tree has more nodes. The stone is initially placed on node 5, which is a leaf node. Ron makes the first move, but since there are multiple possible moves, Hermione can win by making a strategic move.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the tree has only 2 nodes. The stone is initially placed on node 1, and Ron makes the first move. Since there's only one possible move (to node 2), Ron wins.

4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
