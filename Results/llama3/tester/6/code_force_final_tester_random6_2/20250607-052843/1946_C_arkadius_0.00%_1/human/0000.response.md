```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It creates a tree with 5 vertices and removes 1 edge. The expected output is 2, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of vertices is 2 and the number of edges to be removed is 1. The expected output is 1, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 1.

```
**Description**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a larger tree. It creates a tree with 6 vertices and removes 1 edge. The expected output is 3, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of vertices is 3 and the number of edges to be removed is 1. The expected output is 1, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 1.

**Description**: This test case checks the functionality of the code with a larger tree and more edges to be removed. It creates a tree with 6 vertices and removes 2 edges. The expected output is 2, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of vertices is 1 and the number of edges to be removed is 0. The expected output is 1, as the size of each remaining connected component should be at least 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of vertices is 0 and the number of edges to be removed is 0. The expected output is 0, as there are no vertices or edges.
