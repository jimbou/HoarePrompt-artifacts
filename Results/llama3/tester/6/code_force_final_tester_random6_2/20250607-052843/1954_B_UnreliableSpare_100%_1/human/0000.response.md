# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an array with all identical elements, which cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's ability to identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful when there are alternating elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case ensures the function correctly handles an array with a single element, which cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful when there is a single element different from the others.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's ability to handle a larger array with alternating elements.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case ensures the function correctly handles an array with all identical elements, which cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful when there are multiple different elements.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's ability to handle an array with a single element different from the others.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger array with alternating elements.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case ensures the function correctly handles an array with only two elements, which cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
