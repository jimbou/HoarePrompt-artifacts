# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
ab
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 1 and k = 2. The expected output is "ab" because all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ("a" and "b") occur as a subsequence of "ab".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is "aa" because there is only one string of length 2 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet ("a"), and it is present in "aa" as a subsequence.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is "baab" because all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ("aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb") occur as a subsequence of "baab".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbac
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is "abcbac" because all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ("aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", and "cc") occur as a subsequence of "abcbac".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is "a" because there is only one string of length 1 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet ("a"), and it is present in "a" as a subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (26 times)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 26 and k = 26. The expected output is a string of 26 lowercase English alphabets repeated 26 times because all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of this string.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 0 and k = 1. The expected output is an empty string because there are no strings of length 0 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
(empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 1 and k = 0. The expected output is an empty string because there are no strings of length 1 that can be formed using no lowercase English alphabets.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(error message)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = -1 and k = 1. The expected output is an error message because n cannot be negative.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
(error message)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 1 and k = -1. The expected output is an error message because k cannot be negative.
