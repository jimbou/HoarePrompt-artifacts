# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the function by rearranging the elements of the array to maximize the beauty.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
69 69 69
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case evaluates the function's behavior when all elements in the array are equal, resulting in a beauty of 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**: 
```
57
```
This test case verifies the function's ability to handle a larger array with varying elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when there are duplicate elements in the array.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a small array size.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
100
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
This test case checks the function's scalability with a large array size.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case evaluates the function's behavior when all elements in the array are equal.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
-1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the function's behavior with negative numbers in the array.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
5
10^9 10^9 10^9 10^9 10^9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case evaluates the function's behavior with extremely large numbers in the array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
10^9 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10^9 - 1
```
This test case checks the function's behavior with a large difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
