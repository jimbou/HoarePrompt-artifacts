# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input values are 0 and 1. The expected output is 1, as the longest common subsegment is of length 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
12 4
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are 12 and 4. The expected output is 8, as the longest common subsegment is of length 8.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
57 37
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are 57 and 37. The expected output is 4, as the longest common subsegment is of length 4.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
316560849 14570961
```
**Output**: 
```
33554432
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are large numbers. The expected output is 33554432, as the longest common subsegment is of length 33554432.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: x and y cannot be equal
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are equal. The expected output is an error message, as the problem statement specifies that x and y must be distinct.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: x and y must be non-negative
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are negative. The expected output is an error message, as the problem statement specifies that x and y must be non-negative.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are consecutive integers. The expected output is 1, as the longest common subsegment is of length 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: x and y cannot be equal
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are equal. The expected output is an error message, as the problem statement specifies that x and y must be distinct.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are 0 and 2. The expected output is 1, as the longest common subsegment is of length 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input values are 1 and 3. The expected output is 1, as the longest common subsegment is of length 1.
