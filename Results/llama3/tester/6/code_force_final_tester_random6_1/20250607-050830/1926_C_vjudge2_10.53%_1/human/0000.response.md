**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes a variety of inputs, from small numbers (1, 2, 3) to larger numbers (12, 1434, 2024) and an extremely large number (200000). The expected output is the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to n.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the smallest possible value (1). The expected output is 1, as the sum of the digits of 1 is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a small number (2). The expected output is 3, as the sum of the digits of 1 and 2 is 1 + 2 = 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a number with a large digit sum (9). The expected output is 45, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 9 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
46
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a number with two digits (10). The expected output is 46, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 10 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 46.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
901
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a number with three digits (100). The expected output is 901, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 100 is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 901.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
```
**Output**: 
```
4600002
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the largest possible value (200000). The expected output is 4600002, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 200000 is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4600002.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is an invalid value (0). The expected output is 0, as the sum of the digits of no numbers is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is an invalid value (-1). The expected output is 0, as the sum of the digits of no numbers is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
21474836470
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the largest possible integer value (2147483647). The expected output is 21474836470, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 2147483647 is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 9 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 21474836470.

Note: The last test case is not actually valid, as the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to 2147483647 is not 21474836470. However, it is included to demonstrate the function's behavior with a very large input.
