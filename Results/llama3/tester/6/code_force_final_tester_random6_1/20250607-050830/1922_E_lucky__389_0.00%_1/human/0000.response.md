# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input is a small number. The expected output is an array with a single element, which is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a slightly larger input. The expected output is an array with three elements, where the first and last elements are 0, and the middle element is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a moderate-sized input. The expected output is an array with five elements, where the first and last elements are 2, and the middle elements are 2, 3, and 4.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input. The expected output is an array with seven elements, where the first two elements are -1, the next two elements are 0, and the last three elements are 2, 3, and -1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 1, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a very large number. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a negative number, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2.5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a non-integer number, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a non-numeric string, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find the required array.
