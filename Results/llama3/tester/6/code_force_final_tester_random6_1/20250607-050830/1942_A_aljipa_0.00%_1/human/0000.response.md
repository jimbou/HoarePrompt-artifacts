# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Description**: Test case with n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is an array with two elements, both equal to 1, as this satisfies the condition of having exactly k = 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
69420 69 420
```
**Description**: Test case with n = 3 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with three elements, where the first element is greater than the second, and the second is less than the third, resulting in exactly k = 1 sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: Test case with n = 3 and k = 2. Since it's impossible to have exactly k = 2 sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length n = 3, the expected output is -1, indicating that no such array exists.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with a single element, which inherently satisfies the condition of having exactly k = 1 sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 10 and k = 10. The expected output is an array with ten elements, all equal to 1, as this satisfies the condition of having exactly k = 10 sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
[Array of 1000 elements with the first element being 1 and the rest being 2]
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 1000 and k = 1. The expected output is an array of 1000 elements, where the first element is 1 and the rest are 2, resulting in exactly k = 1 sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
[Array of 1000 elements with all elements being 1]
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 1000 and k = 1000. The expected output is an array of 1000 elements, all equal to 1, as this satisfies the condition of having exactly k = 1000 sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 0 and k = 0. Since the problem statement specifies that n and k should be positive integers, the expected output is -1, indicating that no such array exists.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = -1 and k = -1. Since the problem statement specifies that n and k should be positive integers, the expected output is -1, indicating that no such array exists.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1.5 1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: Edge case with n = 1.5 and k = 1.5. Since the problem statement specifies that n and k should be integers, the expected output is -1, indicating that no such array exists.
