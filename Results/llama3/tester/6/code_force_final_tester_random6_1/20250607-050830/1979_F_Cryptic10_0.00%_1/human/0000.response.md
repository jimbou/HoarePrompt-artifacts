**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It includes three test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The first test case has 4 vertices, the second has 4 vertices, and the third has 2 vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 2 vertices in the graph. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 3 vertices in the graph. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 99999
? 99998
...
? 1
! 100000 ... 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are 100000 vertices in the graph. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 2 vertices in the graph and no edges are removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 3 vertices in the graph and no edges are removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 99999
? 99998
...
? 1
! 100000 ... 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are 100000 vertices in the graph and no edges are removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0
! 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 2 vertices in the graph and one edge is removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only 3 vertices in the graph and two edges are removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 99999
? 99998
...
? 1
! 100000 ... 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where there are 100000 vertices in the graph and 99998 edges are removed. The program should be able to handle this case correctly.
