# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array is [1, 2, 3] and the value of x is 1. The function should return 2 because we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 3] such that (1) | (2 ^ 3) = 1.

**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has only two elements. The function should return 2 because we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 2] such that (1) | (1) = 1.

# Test 3

2 3
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has only two elements and the value of x is 3. The function should return 2 because we can divide the array into two segments [1, 1] and [2, 2] such that (0) | (0) = 0.

```
1
3 2
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has three elements and the value of x is 2. The function should return 3 because we can divide the array into three segments [1, 1], [2, 2], and [3, 3] such that (0) | (0) | (1) = 1.

```
1
2 2
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has only two elements and the value of x is 2. The function should return -1 because we cannot divide the array into two segments such that (2) | (3) = 3 > 2.

1
5 0
0 1 2 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has five elements and the value of x is 0. The function should return 1 because we cannot divide the array into two segments such that (0) | (1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 1) = 0.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has only one element. The function should return 1 because we can divide the array into one segment [1, 1] such that (1) = 1.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array has only one element and the value of x is 0. The function should return -1 because we cannot divide the array into one segment such that (1) = 0.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array is empty. The function should return -1 because we cannot divide an empty array into segments.

```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the case where the input array is empty and the value of x is 1. The function should return -1 because we cannot divide an empty array into segments.
