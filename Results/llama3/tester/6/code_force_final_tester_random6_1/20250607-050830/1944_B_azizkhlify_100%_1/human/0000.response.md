# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where n = 2 and k = 1. The input array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6 4
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a larger input size (n = 6) and k = 1. The input array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where n = 4 and k = 1. The input array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where n = 6 and k = 2. The input array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
2 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where n = 2 and k = 1, but the input array contains duplicate elements. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where n = 1 and k = 1. The input array contains only one element, which is repeated twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 1
2 3 4 5 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where n = 5 and k = 3. The input array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The expected output is two arrays l and r, each of length 2k, such that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.
