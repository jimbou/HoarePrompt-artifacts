# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. The input string "10101" has two non-adjacent '1's, which can be turned on by the given operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has two adjacent '1's, which cannot be turned on by the given operation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where there is only one lamp. Since there are no two non-adjacent lamps, the operation cannot be performed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where there are only two lamps. Since the two lamps are adjacent, the operation cannot be performed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input string consists of all '0's. In this case, the operation can be performed zero times, and the configuration can be reached.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input string consists of all '1's. Since there are no two non-adjacent '0's, the operation cannot be performed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has alternating '1's and '0's. The operation can be performed to turn on the '1's.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has alternating '0's and '1's. The operation can be performed to turn on the '1's.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has two non-adjacent '1's separated by a large number of '0's. The operation can be performed to turn on the '1's.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input string consists of all '0's. In this case, the operation can be performed zero times, and the configuration can be reached.
