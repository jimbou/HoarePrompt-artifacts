# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array consists of identical elements. In this case, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the input array has alternating elements. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has only one element. In this case, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the input array has a single element that is different from the rest. In this case, removing three elements is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array consists of identical elements and has a large size. In this case, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the input array has only two elements. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has alternating elements and has an even size. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the input array has alternating elements and has an odd size. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has a single element that is different from the rest and has a small size. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 1 1 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the input array has a single element that is different from the rest and has a medium size. In this case, removing one element is sufficient to make the array not beautiful.
