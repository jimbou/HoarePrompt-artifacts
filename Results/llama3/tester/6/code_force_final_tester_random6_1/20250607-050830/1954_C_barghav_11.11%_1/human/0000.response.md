# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
73
31
```
**Output**: 
```
71
33
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where the input numbers have different digits at the same position, and swapping them would result in a larger product.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2
```
This test case covers the scenario where the input numbers have different digits at the same position, but swapping them would not result in a larger product.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3516
3982
```
**Output**: 
```
3912
3586
```
This test case covers the scenario where the input numbers have multiple digits and swapping some of them would result in a larger product.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1111
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1111
1111
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are identical, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
123456789
987654321
```
**Output**: 
```
987654321
123456789
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers have the maximum possible length (9 digits) and swapping all digits would result in a larger product.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers are single-digit numbers, and no swapping is needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
999999999
999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
999999999
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input numbers have the maximum possible value (all 9's) and no swapping is needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
73
31
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
71
33
5
2
```
This test case covers the scenario where there are multiple test cases, and the function should handle them correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
0
```
**Output**: 
```
(no output)
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where there are no test cases, and the function should not produce any output.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000
73
31
...
```
**Output**: 
```
71
33
...
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where there are a large number of test cases (up to 1000), and the function should handle them correctly.
