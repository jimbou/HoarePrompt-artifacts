```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has two negative numbers and k=2. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the empty subarray twice, which is (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11, modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3 3
2 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
96
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has three positive numbers and k=3. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the entire array three times, which is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1 7
7
```
**Output**:
```
17
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has one positive number and k=7. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the empty subarray seven times, which is 7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7, modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
**Output**:
```
17
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has five numbers with different signs and k=1. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the subarray consisting of the first three numbers at the beginning of the array, which is 10 + 4 - 2 + 8 - 12 + 9 = 17.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
7 4
8 14 -9 6 0 -1 3
```
**Output**:
```
351
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has seven numbers with different signs and k=4. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the entire array four times, which is 8 + 14 - 9 + 6 + 0 - 1 + 3 + 21 + 42 + 84 + 168 = 351.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
7 100
5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3
```
**Output**:
```
716455332
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has seven numbers with different signs and k=100. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the entire array 100 times, which is a large number modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
6 1000
-1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has six large negative numbers and k=1000. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the empty subarray 1000 times, which is -6 \* (10^9 + 7) + 42 = -6\,000\,000\,000, modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2 1
1000000000 8
```
**Output**:
```
1000000008
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has two large positive numbers and k=1. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the entire array once, which is 1000000000 + 8 + 1000000008 = 2000000008, modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
5 4
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has five zeros and k=4. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the empty subarray four times, which is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
6 10
48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984
```
**Output**:
```
897909241
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has six large numbers with different signs and k=10. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the entire array 10 times, which is a large number modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
7 1
-1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the array has seven numbers with alternating signs and k=1. The expected output is the sum of the array after inserting the sum of the empty subarray once, which is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
10 10050
408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045
