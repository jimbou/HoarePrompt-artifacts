```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function with three test cases. The first test case has a square with corners at (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), and (4, 2). The second test case has a square with corners at (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (-1, -1). The third test case has a square with corners at (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), and (17, 39). The expected output is the area of each square, which is 9, 4, and 784 respectively.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where all corners of the square are at the same point (0, 0). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is zero.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 -1000
-1000 1000
1000 -1000
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
4000000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the square has the maximum possible area, with corners at (-1000, -1000), (-1000, 1000), (1000, -1000), and (1000, 1000). The expected output is 4000000, which is the maximum possible area of a square with integer coordinates.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where all corners of the square are at the same point (1, 1). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is zero.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 -1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the square has a small area, with corners at (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), and (1, 1). The expected output is 4, which is the area of the square.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1000
1000 1000
1000 1000
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where all corners of the square are at the same point (1000, 1000). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is zero.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 1000
-1000 -1000
1000 1000
1000 -1000
```
**Output**: 
```
4000000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the square has the maximum possible area, with corners at (-1000, 1000), (-1000, -1000), (1000, 1000), and (1000, -1000). The expected output is 4000000, which is the maximum possible area of a square with integer coordinates.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the square has a small area, with corners at (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), and (-1, 1). The expected output is 4, which is the area of the square.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 -1000
1000 1000
-1000 -1000
-1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
4000000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the square has the maximum possible area, with corners at (1000, -1000), (1000, 1000), (-1000, -1000), and (-1000, 1000). The expected output is 4000000, which is the maximum possible area of a square with integer coordinates.
