5
1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2
```
This test case covers a basic scenario where the input array has a mix of small and large numbers. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
**Output**:
```
11 7 6
```
This test case covers a scenario where the input array has numbers that are close to each other. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
3 2
```
This test case covers a basic scenario where the input array has only two elements. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000001
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array has only one element, which is the maximum possible value. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
4 3 2
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal to 1. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000005 1000000004 1000000003 1000000002 1000000001
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal to the maximum possible value. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
5 4 3
5 4 3
```
This test case covers a scenario where there are multiple test cases. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations for each test case.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
(no output)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array is empty. The expected output is no output, as there are no elements to process.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000
1 1 1 ... (1000000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1000001 1000000 ... (1000000 times)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements. The expected output is the lexicographically largest array that can be constructed by following the given operations.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3
-1 -2 -3
```
**Output**:
```
(error message)
```
This test case covers an edge scenario where the input array has negative numbers. The expected output is an error message, as the problem statement specifies that the input array should have non-negative integers.
