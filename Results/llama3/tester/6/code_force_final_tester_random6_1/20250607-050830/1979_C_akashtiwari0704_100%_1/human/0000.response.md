# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**:
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input contains 3 outcomes with multipliers 3, 2, and 7. The expected output is a distribution of coins such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all multipliers are the same. The input contains 2 outcomes with multipliers 3 and 3. The expected output is a distribution of coins such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all multipliers are the same and it's not possible to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**:
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a larger number of outcomes and varying multipliers.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when it's not possible to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**:
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a larger number of outcomes and varying multipliers.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a single outcome.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a large number of outcomes and all multipliers being the same.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a large number of outcomes and varying multipliers.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (number of outcomes is 0).

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (number of outcomes is negative).

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (multiplier is negative).

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (multiplier is 0).

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (multiplier is 1).

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input (number of multipliers does not match the number of outcomes).
