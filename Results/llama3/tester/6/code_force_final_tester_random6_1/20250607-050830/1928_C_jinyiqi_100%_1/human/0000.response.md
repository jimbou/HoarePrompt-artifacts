# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a single test case with n = 10 and x = 2. The expected output is 4, which corresponds to the values of k that fit the given constraints (k = 2, 3, 5, 6).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is small (n = 3). The input is a single test case with n = 3 and x = 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints (k = 2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a larger input. The input is a single test case with n = 76 and x = 4. The expected output is 9, which corresponds to the values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is close to n (x = 99, n = 100). The input is a single test case with n = 100 and x = 99. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is very large (n = 10^9). The input is a single test case with n = 1000000000 and x = 500000000. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 1. The input is a single test case with n = 1 and x = 1. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints, since k > 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 2. The input is a single test case with n = 2 and x = 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints (k = 2).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is equal to n (x = 10, n = 10). The input is a single test case with n = 10 and x = 10. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where x is 0. The input is a single test case with n = 10 and x = 0. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints, since x must be a positive integer.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 0. The input is a single test case with n = 0 and x = 1. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints, since n must be a positive integer.
