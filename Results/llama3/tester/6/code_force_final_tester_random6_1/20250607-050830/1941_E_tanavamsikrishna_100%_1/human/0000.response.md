```
1
4 4 2 1
0 3 3 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
0 3 3 0
```
**Output**:
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the function when building multiple bridges. The optimal solution is to build bridges on the second and third rows.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 5 2 5
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the function when the maximum distance between supports is large. The optimal solution is to build bridges along the river banks.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 8 1 1
0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the function when there is only one row. The optimal solution is to build a bridge with supports at each cell.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
4 5 3 2
0 8 4 4 0
0 3 4 8 0
0 8 1 10 0
0 10 1 5 0
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the function when building multiple bridges with different maximum distances between supports.
