# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5
10010
00001
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The initial state is "10010" and the desired state is "00001". The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is the same as the desired state. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3
000
111
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is all zeros and the desired state is all ones. The function should return 3, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4
0101
1010
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is a mix of zeros and ones, and the desired state is also a mix of zeros and ones. The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
100
101
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is almost the same as the desired state, but with a small difference. The function should return 1, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
8
10011001
11111110
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is a mix of zeros and ones, and the desired state is also a mix of zeros and ones, but with a larger difference. The function should return 4, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input is an empty string. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input is a single character. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100000
000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input is a large string of zeros and ones. The function should return 1, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
111111
111111
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the input is a large string of ones. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.
