# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With a 4x4 chessboard and one move already played (1, 2), there are three possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a larger chessboard (8x8) and one move already played (7, 6).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's scalability with a large chessboard (1000x1000) and four moves already played.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the chessboard size is 1x1 and no moves have been played.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when all possible moves have been played on a 3x3 chessboard.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's performance when a move is played on a 2x2 chessboard, resulting in no valid moves remaining.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
5 0
```
**Output**:
```
3125
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a 5x5 chessboard with no moves played.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
300000 0
```
**Output**:
```
(modulo 10^9+7)
```
**Explanation**: This test case pushes the code's scalability to its limit with a large chessboard (300000x300000) and no moves played.
