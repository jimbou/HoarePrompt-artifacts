# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a win in any outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of outcomes is 2 and the multipliers are both 3. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a win in any outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where all multipliers are the same (5). In this case, it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that ensures a win in any outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Description**: This test case covers a more complex scenario with 6 outcomes and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a win in any outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case covers another edge scenario where the multipliers are not all the same, but it is still impossible to distribute the coins in a way that ensures a win in any outcome. The expected output is -1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario with 5 outcomes and varying multipliers. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a win in any outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there is only one outcome. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a win in that outcome.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of outcomes is the maximum allowed (50) and all multipliers are the same (2). In this case, it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that ensures a win in any outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of outcomes is the maximum allowed (50) and all multipliers are the maximum allowed (20). In this case, it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that ensures a win in any outcome, so the expected output is -1.
