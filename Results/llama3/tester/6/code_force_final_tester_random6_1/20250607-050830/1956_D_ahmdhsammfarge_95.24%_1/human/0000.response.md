# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The input array is [0, 1] of length 2. The expected output is 4, which is the maximum sum of elements that can be achieved by performing the operation once, and the operation details (1 2).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the code correctly handles cases where no operation is needed to achieve the maximum sum. The input array is [1, 3, 9] of length 3. The expected output is 13, which is the sum of the elements in the array, and 0 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to perform multiple operations to achieve the maximum sum. The input array is [1, 100, 2, 1] of length 4. The expected output is 105, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing two operations, and the operation details (3 3 and 3 4).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior for an array of length 1. The input array is [0] of length 1. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing one operation, and the operation details (1 1).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
171 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large arrays. The input array is [0, 0, ..., 0] of length 18. The expected output is 171, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing one operation, and the operation details (1 18).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the code correctly handles cases where the input array is already in the optimal state. The input array is [1, 2, ..., 10] of length 10. The expected output is 55, which is the sum of the elements in the array, and 0 operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
25 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to perform an operation to achieve the maximum sum. The input array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] of length 5. The expected output is 25, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing one operation, and the operation details (1 5).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
15
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
120 1
1 15
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle arrays with repeated elements. The input array is [1, 1, ..., 1] of length 15. The expected output is 120, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing one operation, and the operation details (1 15).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
20
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```
**Output**: 
```
210 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the code correctly handles cases where the input array is already in the optimal state. The input array is [0, 1, ..., 19] of length 20. The expected output is 210, which is the sum of the elements in the array, and 0 operations.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
12
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
144 1
1 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle arrays with repeated elements. The input array is [1, 1, ..., 1] of length 12. The expected output is 144, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing one operation, and the operation details (1 12).
