# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb". The second line of the output is the string "aa" which is not a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', and 'c') occur as a subsequence of the string "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab". The second line of the output is the string "ccc" which is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("a") is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
b
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "NO" because the string "b" is not a subsequence of "a". The second line of the output is the string "b" which is not a subsequence of "a".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings are subsequences of the given string.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
NO
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The expected output is "NO" because the string "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" is not a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The second line of the output is the string "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" which is not a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 26 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
b
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "NO" because the string "b" is not a subsequence of "a". The second line of the output is the string "b" which is not a subsequence of "a".

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
26 1 1000
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the string "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") is a subsequence of "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "NO" because the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" is not a subsequence of "a". The second line of the output is the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" which is not a subsequence of "a".
