# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
2
```
This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the number of coins is 7 and the number of jewels to be bought is 3. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to set up a single stall with a price of 2, allowing Alice to buy 3 jewels and be left with 1 coin.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks that the function returns "NO" when it is impossible to set up stalls to buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the number of coins is 255 and the number of jewels to be bought is 8. The expected output is "YES" with 8 stalls, each with a price that allows Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel at each stall, leaving her with 0 coins at the end.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when both the number of coins and the number of jewels to be bought are 1. The expected output is "YES" with a single stall having a price of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10^18 10^18
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case evaluates the function's handling of the maximum possible input values. The expected output is "YES" with a single stall having a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy all her coins' worth of jewels.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10^18 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
10^18
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of coins is at its maximum, but the number of jewels to be bought is 1. The expected output is "YES" with a single stall having a price equal to the number of coins, allowing Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 10^18
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly returns "NO" when the number of coins is 1, but the number of jewels to be bought is at its maximum, making it impossible to fulfill the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks the function's handling of invalid input where the number of coins is 0, but the number of jewels to be bought is 1. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to buy jewels without any coins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of coins is 1, but the number of jewels to be bought is 0. The expected output is "YES" with 0 stalls, as there is no need to set up any stalls to buy 0 jewels.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
This test case checks the function's handling of the edge case where both the number of coins and the number of jewels to be bought are 0. The expected output is "YES" with 0 stalls, as there is no need to set up any stalls to buy 0 jewels.
