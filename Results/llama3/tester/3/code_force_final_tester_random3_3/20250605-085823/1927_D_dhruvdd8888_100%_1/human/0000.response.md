**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. It includes multiple test cases with different array lengths, query counts, and query ranges. The expected output is provided for each test case.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and the query range is the entire array. The expected output is `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1

1 2
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and the query range is the entire array. The expected output is `1 2` because there are two different elements in the array.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1

1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element, and the query range is the entire array. The expected output is `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the array.

# Test 5

1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and there are multiple queries with the same range. The expected output is `-1 -1` for each query because there are no two different elements in the array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1

1 2
2
1 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and there are multiple queries with different ranges. The expected output is `-1 -1` for the first query and `1 2` for the second query.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1

**Output**: 
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element, and there are multiple queries with the same range. The expected output is `-1 -1` for each query because there are no two different elements in the array.

```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1

```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements, and there are multiple queries with different ranges. The expected output is `-1 -1` for the first query and `1 2` for the second and third queries.

# Test 10
