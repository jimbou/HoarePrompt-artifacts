# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It should return 4 because k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is small. It should return 1 because k = 2 is suitable.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a larger input. It should return 9 because there are 9 different k that fit under the given constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where x is very close to n. It should return 0 because there are no k that fit under the given constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is very large. It should return 1 because there is only one k that fits under the given constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 1. It should return 0 because there are no k that fit under the given constraints.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 2. It should return 1 because k = 2 is suitable.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where x is equal to n. It should return 0 because there are no k that fit under the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It should return 4 because k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
49
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a larger input. It should return 49 because there are 49 different k that fit under the given constraints.
