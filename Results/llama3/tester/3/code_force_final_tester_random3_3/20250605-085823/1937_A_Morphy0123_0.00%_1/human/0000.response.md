```
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has four elements. The swap operations are performed as described in the problem statement, and the position of 1 is updated accordingly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has five elements. The swap operations are performed as described in the problem statement, and the position of 1 is updated accordingly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
120240229
```
**Output**: 
```
67108864
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a large number of elements. The swap operations are performed as described in the problem statement, and the position of 1 is updated accordingly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has three elements. The swap operations are performed as described in the problem statement, and the position of 1 is updated accordingly.
