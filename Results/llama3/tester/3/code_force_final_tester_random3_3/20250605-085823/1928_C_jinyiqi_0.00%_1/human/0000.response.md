# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
10 2
3 1
76 4
100 99
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1
9
0
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the code. It includes five different test cases with varying inputs for n and x.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is equal to 1. According to the problem description, settling does not exist for k = 1, so the output should be 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is equal to 2. In this case, k should be equal to 2, which is the only possible value.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is a large number (10^9) and x is 1. In this case, k should be equal to 2, which is the only possible value.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is a large number (10^9) and x is close to n. In this case, there should be no possible values for k.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where x is equal to n. According to the problem description, x should be less than n, so the output should be 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where x is 0. According to the problem description, x should be a positive integer, so the output should be 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 0. According to the problem description, n should be a positive integer, so the output should be 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where n is a negative number. According to the problem description, n should be a positive integer, so the output should be 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where x is a negative number. According to the problem description, x should be a positive integer, so the output should be 0.
