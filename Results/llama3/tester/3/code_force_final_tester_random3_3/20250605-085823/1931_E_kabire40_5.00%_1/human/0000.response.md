# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Anna has two options to reverse the digits of either 14 or 2. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^2, thus winning the game.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has three options to reverse the digits of 9, 56, or 1. If she reverses 9, Sasha can concatenate 65 and 1 to form 651, which is less than 10^5. If she reverses 56, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 1 to form 91, which is also less than 10^5. If she reverses 1, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 65 to form 965, which is again less than 10^5. Therefore, Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has four options to reverse the digits of 1, 2007, 800, or 1580. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining three numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^10, thus winning the game.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has four options to reverse the digits of 5000, 123, 30, or 4. If she reverses 5000, Sasha can concatenate 321 and 30 to form 32130, which is greater than or equal to 10^5. If she reverses 123, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 30 to form 500030, which is also greater than or equal to 10^5. If she reverses 30, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 321 to form 5000321, which is again greater than or equal to 10^5. If she reverses 4, Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 123 to form 5000123, which is greater than or equal to 10^5. Therefore, Sasha wins.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has ten options to reverse the digits of 6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, or 7. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining nine numbers to form a number less than 10^10, thus Anna wins.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has only one option to reverse the digits of 6. Since there is only one number, Sasha cannot concatenate any numbers, and the game ends with Anna winning.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has only one option to reverse the digits of 10. Since there is only one number, Sasha cannot concatenate any numbers, but the number 10 is greater than or equal to 10^1, thus Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Anna has eight options to reverse the digits of 1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, or 2. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining seven numbers to form a number less than 10^9, thus Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**:
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Anna has four options to reverse the digits of 10, 10, 10, or 10. Regardless of her choice, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining three numbers to form a number greater than or equal to 10^5, thus Sasha wins.
