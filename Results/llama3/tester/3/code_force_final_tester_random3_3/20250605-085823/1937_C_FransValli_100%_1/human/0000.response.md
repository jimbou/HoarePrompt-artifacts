Here are the test cases for the given problem:

**Test 1: Basic Test Case**
**Input**:
```
2
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
< 
? 1 1 2 3
= 
? 1 2 0 3
> 
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. The input is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the output is a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

**Test 2: Edge Test Case - n = 2**
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where n = 2. In this case, the permutation is either [0, 1] or [1, 0], and the output is a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

**Test 3: Edge Test Case - n = 10^4**
**Input**:
```
1
10000
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 9999 9998 9997
< 
? 1 1 9999 9998
= 
? 1 9999 0 9998
> 
! 9999 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where n = 10^4. In this case, the permutation is a large array of integers from 0 to n-1, and the output is a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

**Test 4: Edge Test Case - Duplicate Elements**
**Input**:
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
< 
? 1 1 2 3
= 
? 1 2 0 3
> 
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation contains duplicate elements. In this case, the output is a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

**Test 5: Edge Test Case - Negative Numbers**
**Input**:
```
1
4
-1 0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
< 
? 1 1 2 3
= 
? 1 2 0 3
> 
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation contains negative numbers. In this case, the output is a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.

Note: The output for each test case is not exhaustive, but rather a sample output to demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
