# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input sequence contains one of each number (1, 2, 3, and 0). The expected output is 1, indicating that Bob can win once.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the input sequence contains one 1, no 2s, one 3, and two 4s. The expected output is 1, indicating that Bob can win once.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input sequence contains two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, and no 4s. The expected output is 3, indicating that Bob can win three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the input sequence contains three 1s, three 2s, two 3s, and no 4s. The expected output is 3, indicating that Bob can win three times.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input sequence contains no 1s, nine 2s, nine 3s, and nine 4s. The expected output is 12, indicating that Bob can win 12 times.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the input sequence contains no numbers. The expected output is 0, indicating that Bob cannot win.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**: 
```
200
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input sequence contains the maximum number of each number (200). The expected output is 200, indicating that Bob can win 200 times.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the input sequence contains one of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). The expected output is 1, indicating that Bob can win once.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input sequence contains two of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). The expected output is 3, indicating that Bob can win three times.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the input sequence contains three of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). The expected output is 3, indicating that Bob can win three times.
