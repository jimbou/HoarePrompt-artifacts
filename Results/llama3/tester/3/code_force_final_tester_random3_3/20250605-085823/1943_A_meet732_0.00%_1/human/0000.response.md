# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, and Bob chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final array c is [0, 1, 2, 3], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only one element. Alice chooses the element 1, and Bob chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the input array contains only one element, which is 0. Alice chooses the element 0, and the final array c is [0], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array contains duplicate elements. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 0, and Alice chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0, 1], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final array c is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array contains multiple duplicate elements. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final array c is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array contains multiple duplicate elements. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final array c is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which has a MEX of 1.
