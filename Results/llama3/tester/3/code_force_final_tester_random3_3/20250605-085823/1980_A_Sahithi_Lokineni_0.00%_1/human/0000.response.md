# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input string contains 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'E', and 'D'. The function should output 2, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 2 more problems of difficulty levels 'A' and 'F' to hold 1 round.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than 1. The input string contains the same 10 problems as in Test 1, but the number of rounds is 2. The function should output 5, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 5 more problems of difficulty levels 'A', 'F', 'A', 'F', and one more of any difficulty level to hold 2 rounds.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string contains fewer problems than the number of rounds. The input string contains 9 problems with difficulties 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'G', and 'G'. The function should output 1, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 1 more problem of difficulty level 'A' to hold 1 round.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string contains exactly the same number of problems as the number of rounds, and all difficulty levels are present. The input string contains 5 problems with difficulties 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. The function should output 0, indicating that Vlad does not need to come up with any more problems to hold 5 rounds.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string is empty. The function should output 7, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 7 problems of all difficulty levels to hold 1 round.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is 0. The function should output 0, indicating that Vlad does not need to come up with any problems to hold 0 rounds.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is greater than the number of problems in the input string. The function should output 7, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 7 more problems of all difficulty levels to hold 10 rounds.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string contains a large number of problems. The input string contains 50 problems with difficulties 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', repeated 7 times. The function should output 0, indicating that Vlad does not need to come up with any more problems to hold 5 rounds.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of rounds is equal to the number of problems in the input string. The input string contains 50 problems with difficulties 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', repeated 7 times. The function should output 0, indicating that Vlad does not need to come up with any more problems to hold 50 rounds.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
7000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input string is empty and the number of rounds is large. The function should output 7000, indicating that Vlad needs to come up with 7000 problems of all difficulty levels to hold 1000 rounds.
