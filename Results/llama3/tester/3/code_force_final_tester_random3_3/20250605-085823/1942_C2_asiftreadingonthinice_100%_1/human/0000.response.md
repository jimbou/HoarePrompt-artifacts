2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4), and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999000000
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's scalability by using the maximum allowed number of sides (10^9) and the maximum allowed number of vertices Bessie can choose (2 \* 10^5).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd, and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's behavior when Bessie has chosen two adjacent vertices.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd, and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices.

```
1
6 4 1
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even, and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9 5 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is odd, and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices.
