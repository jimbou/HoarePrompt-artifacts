# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. The input string "10101" has non-adjacent lamps that can be turned on, so the expected output is "YES".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has adjacent lamps that are turned on. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where there is only one lamp. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to turn on a single lamp by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where there are only two lamps. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to turn on both lamps by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a large number of lamps. The `has_close_elements` function should return "YES" because it's possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has all lamps turned off. The `has_close_elements` function should return "YES" because it's possible to reach this configuration by not turning on any lamps.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has all lamps turned on. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has an alternating pattern of turned on and off lamps. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a large number of lamps turned off, with only two lamps turned on at the beginning and end. The `has_close_elements` function should return "YES" because it's possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a large number of lamps turned off, with only one lamp turned on at the end. The `has_close_elements` function should return "NO" because it's not possible to reach this configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.
