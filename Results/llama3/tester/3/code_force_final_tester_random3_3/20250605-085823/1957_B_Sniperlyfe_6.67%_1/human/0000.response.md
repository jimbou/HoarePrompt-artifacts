# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 1. The function should return a single integer that is equal to k.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2. The function should return two integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k is odd. The function should return two integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6
51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is large and k is also large. The function should return a sequence of integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 1 and k = 1. The function should return a single integer that is equal to k.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n = 2 and k = 1. The function should return two integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
100000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
// A sequence of 100000 integers that sum up to 1000000000 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is very large and k is also very large. The function should return a sequence of integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
200000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
// A sequence of 200000 integers that sum up to 1 and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is very large and k is very small. The function should return a sequence of integers that sum up to k and have the maximum number of 1s in their binary representation.
