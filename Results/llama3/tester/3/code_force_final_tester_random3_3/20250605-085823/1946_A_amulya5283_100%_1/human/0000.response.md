# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the median is not the smallest element in the array. The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the first two elements to 4 and 4, the median becomes 4, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains a single element. The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the element to 1000000001, the median becomes 1000000001, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the median is not unique in the array. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, 6, and 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the median is not the smallest element in the array and there are multiple elements less than the median. The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first two elements to 3 and 3, the median becomes 3, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains only two elements. The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains two identical elements. The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements to 2, the median becomes 2, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains all identical elements. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements to 6, 6, and 6, the median becomes 6, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array is empty. The median of an empty array is undefined, so the function should return 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains the maximum possible integer value. The median of the array [2147483647] is 2147483647. By increasing the element to 2147483648, the median becomes 2147483648, which is greater than the original median.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1
-2147483648
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains the minimum possible integer value. The median of the array [-2147483648] is -2147483648. By increasing the element to -2147483647, the median becomes -2147483647, which is greater than the original median.
