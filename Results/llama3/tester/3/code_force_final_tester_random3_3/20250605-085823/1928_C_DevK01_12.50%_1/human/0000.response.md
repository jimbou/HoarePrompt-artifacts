# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a simple case where Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 2. The expected output is 4, which corresponds to the values of k that fit the given constraints (2, 3, 5, 6).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints (2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a larger input. The input is a case where Vasya's position is 76 and the number he received is 4. The expected output is 9, which corresponds to the values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 100 and the number he received is 99. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1000000000 and the number he received is 500000000. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 2. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1000000000 and the number he received is 1. The expected output is 1, which corresponds to the value of k that fits the given constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where Vasya's position is 1000000000 and the number he received is 1000000000. The expected output is 0, which indicates that there are no values of k that fit the given constraints.
