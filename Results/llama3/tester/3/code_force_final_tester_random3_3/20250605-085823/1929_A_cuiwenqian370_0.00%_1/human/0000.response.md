# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0
57
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has a mix of increasing and decreasing elements. The expected output is the maximum beauty that can be obtained by rearranging the elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only two elements, both of which are the same. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array is already sorted in ascending order. The expected output is the maximum beauty that can be obtained, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array is already sorted in descending order. The expected output is the maximum beauty that can be obtained, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has negative elements. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
-10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has all negative elements. The expected output is the maximum beauty that can be obtained, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal to 1. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal to 10. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has all elements equal to -1. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty.
