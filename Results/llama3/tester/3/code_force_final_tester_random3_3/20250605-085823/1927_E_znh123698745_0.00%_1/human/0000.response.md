# Test 1
**Input**:
```
5
2 2
3 2
10 4
13 4
7 4
```
**Output**:
```
2 1
1 3 2
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
1 6 3 7 2 5 4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem, where we have different values of n and k, and we need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n and k are both 2, which is the minimum possible value for k.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 3 2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 3 and k is 2, which is a small but valid input.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**:
```
1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 10 and k is 4, which is a moderate-sized input.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
13 4
```
**Output**:
```
4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 13 and k is 4, which is a larger input.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
7 4
```
**Output**:
```
1 6 3 7 2 5 4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 7 and k is 4, which is another moderate-sized input.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
200000 2
```
**Output**:
```
(should generate a valid k-level permutation of length 200000)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is at its maximum value (200000) and k is 2, which is an extreme case.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000
```
**Output**:
```
(should generate a valid k-level permutation of length 200000)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n and k are both at their maximum value (200000), which is an extreme case.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 200000
```
**Output**:
```
(should generate an error or handle this invalid input)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 2 and k is 200000, which is an invalid input since k cannot be greater than n.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200001
```
**Output**:
```
(should generate an error or handle this invalid input)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where n is 200000 and k is 200001, which is an invalid input since k cannot be greater than n.
