1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two distinct stick lengths, and multiple combinations of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where all sticks have the same length, and many combinations of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input size is at its maximum limit, and the function should be able to handle it efficiently.

3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where all sticks have length 0, and one combination of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
