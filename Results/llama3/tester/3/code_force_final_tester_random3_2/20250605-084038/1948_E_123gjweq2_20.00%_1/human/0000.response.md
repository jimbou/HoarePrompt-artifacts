# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a small graph (2 vertices) and a moderate value of k (3). It verifies that the code can assign distinct integers to each vertex and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**:
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a slightly larger graph (5 vertices) and a moderate value of k (4). It checks that the code can handle a graph with more vertices and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
8 16
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case examines the code's behavior with a larger graph (8 vertices) and a large value of k (16). It verifies that the code can handle a graph with many vertices and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior with a small graph (2 vertices) and a small value of k (1). It verifies that the code can handle a graph with a small value of k and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
40 40
```
**Output**:
```

```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a large graph (40 vertices) and a large value of k (40). It checks that the code can handle a graph with many vertices and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior with a graph containing only one vertex and a value of k equal to 1. It verifies that the code can handle a graph with a single vertex and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case examines the code's behavior with a small graph (2 vertices) and a moderate value of k (2). It verifies that the code can handle a graph with a moderate value of k and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 8

```
1
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
1
1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a small graph (3 vertices) and a moderate value of k (3). It checks that the code can handle a graph with more vertices and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.

# Test 9
**Input**:

1
4 4
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case examines the code's behavior with a small graph (4 vertices) and a moderate value of k (4). It verifies that the code can handle a graph with more vertices and still partition it into the minimum number of cliques.
