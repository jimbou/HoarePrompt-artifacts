3 3 4
1 3 5
2 4 6
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when the arrays have different lengths.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 5 4
1 4
7 3 4 4 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when one array has only two elements.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 1 4 3
2 5 2
3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is not possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when one array has only two elements.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
6 4 4 2
1 5 2
3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is not possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when one array has only two elements.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000 400000
[1-200000]
[1-200000]
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when the arrays have a large number of elements.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000 400000
[1-200000]
[200001-400000]
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is not possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when the arrays have a large number of elements.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000 400000
[1-199999, 200001]
[1-200000]
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can correctly identify that it is not possible to choose elements from both arrays to include all numbers from 1 to k, even when the arrays have a large number of elements and one array is missing one element.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000 400000
[1-200000]
[1-199999, 200001]
