# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the matrix size is 1x1. The maximum sum that can be achieved is 1, and it can be done in 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
**Description**: This test case covers a slightly larger matrix size of 2x2. The maximum sum that can be achieved is 7, and it can be done in 3 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
500
```
**Output**: 
```
125250000 1000
... (1000 operations)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the maximum matrix size of 500x500. The maximum sum that can be achieved is 125250000, and it can be done in 1000 operations.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
500

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
1 1
1 1 1
...
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input contains 500 test cases, each with a matrix size of 1x1. The maximum sum that can be achieved for each test case is 1, and it can be done in 1 operation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the matrix size is 0x0. The maximum sum that can be achieved is 0, and it can be done in 0 operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Matrix size cannot be negative
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the matrix size is negative. The function should output an error message.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Matrix size must be an integer
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the matrix size is a non-integer. The function should output an error message.
