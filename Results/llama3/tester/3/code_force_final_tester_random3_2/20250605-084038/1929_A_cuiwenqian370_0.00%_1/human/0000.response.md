# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array is [2, 1, 3]. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2, 3]. The beauty is calculated as (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
69 69 69
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all elements in the array are the same. The beauty of the array is 0 because there is no difference between any two elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**: 
```
57
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger array with varying elements. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is calculated as (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are duplicate elements in the array. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [3, 3, 3, 4]. The beauty is calculated as (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has only two elements. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2]. The beauty is calculated as (2 - 1) = 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where both elements in the array are the same. The beauty of the array is 0 because there is no difference between the two elements.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array has only one element. The beauty of the array is 0 because there are no pairs of elements to calculate the difference.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input. Array length must be at least 2.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array is empty. The function should return an error message because the array length must be at least 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input. Array length must be a positive integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array length is a negative number. The function should return an error message because the array length must be a positive integer.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input. Array length must be an integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array length is a floating-point number. The function should return an error message because the array length must be an integer.
