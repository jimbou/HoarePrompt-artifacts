# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
3 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The sequence a is [3, 5] and there is only one value n = 5. The function should return the number of players declared as winners, which is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 3
2 4 6 7 9
1 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a is longer than the number of players. The sequence a is [2, 4, 6, 7, 9] and the values of n are [1, 3, 5]. The function should return the number of players declared as winners for each value of n.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 4
3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 2 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has consecutive integers. The sequence a is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and the values of n are [1, 2, 3, 4]. The function should return the number of players declared as winners for each value of n.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 3
69 96
1 10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
1 10 68
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has large integers. The sequence a is [69, 96] and the values of n are [1, 10, 100]. The function should return the number of players declared as winners for each value of n.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
100
50
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has only one integer. The sequence a is [100] and the value of n is 50. The function should return the number of players declared as winners.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
10 20 30
1 10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
1 9 9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has large integers and the values of n are also large. The sequence a is [10, 20, 30] and the values of n are [1, 10, 100]. The function should return the number of players declared as winners for each value of n.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has only two integers and the value of n is 1. The sequence a is [1, 2] and the value of n is 1. The function should return the number of players declared as winners.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has only one integer and the value of n is also 1. The sequence a is [1] and the value of n is 1. The function should return the number of players declared as winners.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
100 100
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has large integers and the value of n is 1. The sequence a is [100, 100] and the value of n is 1. The function should return the number of players declared as winners.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
100
100
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the sequence a has only one integer and the value of n is also 100. The sequence a is [100] and the value of n is 100. The function should return the number of players declared as winners.
