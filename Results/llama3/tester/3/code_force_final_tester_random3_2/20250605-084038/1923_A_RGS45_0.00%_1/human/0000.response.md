```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function. It includes five different test cases with varying numbers of cells and chip distributions. The expected output is provided for each test case.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there is only one chip and one free cell. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chip to the closest free cell to the left.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there is only one chip and one free cell, but the chip is at the rightmost position. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chip to the closest free cell to the left.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there is only one cell and it contains a chip. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chip to the closest free cell to the left.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there is only one cell and it is free. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chip to the closest free cell to the left.

# Test 6
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all cells contain chips. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chips to the closest free cell to the left.

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all cells are free. The expected output is 0, as no operations are needed to move the chips to the closest free cell to the left.

# Test 8

```
**Output**: 
```
24
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the cells contain alternating chips and free cells. The expected output is 24, as 24 operations are needed to move the chips to the closest free cell to the left.
