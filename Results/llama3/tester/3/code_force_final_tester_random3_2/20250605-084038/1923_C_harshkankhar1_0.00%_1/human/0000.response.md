# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 5 and there are 4 queries. The queries cover different subarrays, and the expected output is based on whether each subarray is good or not.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has a length of 1 and there is only 1 query. Since the subarray has only one element, it cannot be good.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has a length of 2 and there is only 1 query. Since the subarray has only two elements and both are 1, it cannot be good.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 3 and there is only 1 query. The subarray from index 1 to 3 is good because the sum of its elements is 6, which can be achieved with a different array b (e.g., [2, 2, 2]).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 3 and there are 2 queries. Both subarrays are good because their sums can be achieved with different arrays b.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 1 1 1
1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array c has a length of 4 and there is only 1 query. The subarray from index 1 to 4 is not good because the sum of its elements is 4, and it is not possible to achieve this sum with a different array b where all elements are greater than 0 and different from the original array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2 1 4 5
1 3
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 5 and there are 2 queries. Both subarrays are good because their sums can be achieved with different arrays b.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2 1 4 5 6
1 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 6 and there is only 1 query. The subarray from index 1 to 6 is good because the sum of its elements is 19, which can be achieved with a different array b (e.g., [2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 1]).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
7 1
1 2 1 4 5 6 7
1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 7 and there is only 1 query. The subarray from index 1 to 7 is good because the sum of its elements is 26, which can be achieved with a different array b (e.g., [2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 1]).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 1
1 2 1 4 5 6 7 8
1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the array c has a length of 8 and there is only 1 query. The subarray from index 1 to 8 is good because the sum of its elements is 34, which can be achieved with a different array b (e.g., [2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1]).
