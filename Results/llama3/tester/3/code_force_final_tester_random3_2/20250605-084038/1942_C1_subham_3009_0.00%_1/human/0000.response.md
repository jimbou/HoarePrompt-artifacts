# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
6
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is less than or equal to the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
999999
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is large (200000) and the number of sides of the polygon is also large (1000000).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is small (2) and the number of sides of the polygon is also small (4).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
8 8 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is equal to the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 1 0
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 1, which is the minimum possible value.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
4 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is equal to the number of sides of the polygon, and all vertices are chosen.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
8 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 0, and the number of sides of the polygon is large.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 1 less than the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 999999 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
999998
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 1 less than the number of sides of the polygon, and the number of sides of the polygon is large.
