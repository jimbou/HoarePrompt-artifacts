50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a large input size (n = 50). In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's behavior when the input contains duplicate values. In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the input contains consecutive values. In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

**Input**: 
```
1
4
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the input contains values in reverse order. In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's behavior when the input contains values in reverse order with an odd number of friends. In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the input contains values in reverse order with an even number of friends. In this scenario, the function should still be able to determine the minimum number of invitations required.
