# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only one element. The expected output is 1, as there are no operations to be performed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the function's behavior for a small input array. The expected output is 4, as shown in the problem description.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for a slightly larger input array. The expected output is 4, as the element 1 will be swapped to the 4th position.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
120240229
```
**Output**: 
```
67108864
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for a large input array. The expected output is 67108864, as the element 1 will be swapped to this position after performing the operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for the smallest possible input array with more than one element. The expected output is 2, as the element 1 will be swapped to the 2nd position.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for the maximum possible input value. The expected output is 536870912, as the element 1 will be swapped to this position after performing the operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for a small input array. The expected output is 2, as the element 1 will be swapped to the 2nd position.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for a moderate-sized input array. The expected output is 8, as the element 1 will be swapped to this position after performing the operations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100
```
**Output**: 
```
64
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for a larger input array. The expected output is 64, as the element 1 will be swapped to this position after performing the operations.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
512
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for an even larger input array. The expected output is 512, as the element 1 will be swapped to this position after performing the operations.
