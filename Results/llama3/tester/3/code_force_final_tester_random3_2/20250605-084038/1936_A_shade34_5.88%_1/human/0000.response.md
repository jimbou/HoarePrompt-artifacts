# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It provides two test cases with different values of n (4 and 2). The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 2. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is 1. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? ... (multiple queries)
! i j
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where n is large (10000). The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized within the allowed number of queries (3n).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [0, 1]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [1, 0]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 3 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 2 3 1
? 1 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [0, 3, 1, 2]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 1 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
? ... (multiple queries)
! i j
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [2, 1, 3, 0]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
? ... (multiple queries)
! i j
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [3, 0, 2, 1]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
? ... (multiple queries)
! i j
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the permutation p is [1, 2, 0, 3]. The code should be able to find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.
