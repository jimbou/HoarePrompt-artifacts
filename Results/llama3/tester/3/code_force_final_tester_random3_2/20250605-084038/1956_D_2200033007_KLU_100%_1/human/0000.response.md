# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The input array is [0, 1] of length 2. The expected output is 4 (maximum sum) and 1 (number of operations). The operation is to replace the subarray [0, 1] with [2, 2] which gives the maximum sum.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the code handles cases where no operations are needed. The input array is [1, 3, 9] of length 3. The expected output is 13 (maximum sum) and 0 (number of operations) since the array already has the maximum sum.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's ability to perform multiple operations. The input array is [1, 100, 2, 1] of length 4. The expected output is 105 (maximum sum) and 2 (number of operations). The operations are to replace the subarray [2] with [0] and then replace the subarray [0, 1] with [2, 2] which gives the maximum sum.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's handling of arrays of length 1. The input array is [0] of length 1. The expected output is 1 (maximum sum) and 1 (number of operations). The operation is to replace the subarray [0] with [1] which gives the maximum sum.

**Description**: This test case checks the code's handling of large arrays. The input array is [0, 0, ..., 0] of length 18. The expected output is 171 (maximum sum) and 17 (number of operations). The operations are to replace each subarray [0] with [1], [2], ..., [18] which gives the maximum sum.

# Test 6
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
180000000 0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's handling of large numbers. The input array is [10000000, 10000000, ..., 10000000] of length 18. The expected output is 180000000 (maximum sum) and 0 (number of operations) since the array already has the maximum sum.

**Description**: This test case checks the code's handling of arrays with distinct elements. The input array is [0, 1, 2, ..., 17] of length 18. The expected output is 171 (maximum sum) and 17 (number of operations). The operations are to replace each subarray [i] with [i+1] which gives the maximum sum.
