# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the game. Anna can reverse the integer 2, then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and 14, obtaining the integer 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Anna has more options to reverse the integers. Anna can reverse the integer 9, then Sasha can concatenate the integers 9 and 56, obtaining the integer 956, which is less than 10^5 = 100000.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Sasha has more options to concatenate the integers. Sasha can concatenate the integers 2007 and 1580, obtaining the integer 20071580, which is greater than 10^10 = 10000000000.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Anna has more options to reverse the integers. Anna can reverse the integer 5000, then Sasha can concatenate the integers 5000 and 123, obtaining the integer 5000123, which is greater than 10^5 = 100000.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Anna has more options to reverse the integers. Anna can reverse the integer 6, then Sasha can concatenate the integers 6 and 4, obtaining the integer 64, which is less than 10^10 = 10000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when there is only one integer. Anna can reverse the integer 6, then Sasha can't make a move, so Anna wins.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when there is only one integer and it is greater than or equal to 10^m. Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when Anna has more options to reverse the integers. Anna can reverse the integer 1, then Sasha can concatenate the integers 1 and 2, obtaining the integer 12, which is less than 10^9 = 1000000000.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the game when all integers are the same. Sasha can concatenate the integers 10 and 10, obtaining the integer 1010, which is greater than 10^5 = 100000.
