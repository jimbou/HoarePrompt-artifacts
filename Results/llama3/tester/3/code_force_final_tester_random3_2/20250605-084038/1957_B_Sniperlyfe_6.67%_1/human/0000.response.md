# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 1 and k = 5. The expected output is 5, as it is the only possible sequence that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is 1 2, as it is one of the possible sequences that maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 5. The expected output is 5 0, as it is one of the possible sequences that maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6
51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 6 and k = 51. The expected output is 3 1 1 32 2 12, as it is one of the possible sequences that maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is 1, as it is the only possible sequence that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 0. The expected output is 0, as it is the only possible sequence that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is 1 0, as it is one of the possible sequences that maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 0. The expected output is 0 0, as it is the only possible sequence that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
(maximum possible sequence of 1s and 0s)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is large (100000) and k is also large (1000000000). The expected output is a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
200000
2000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
(maximum possible sequence of 1s and 0s)
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n is very large (200000) and k is also very large (2000000000). The expected output is a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.
