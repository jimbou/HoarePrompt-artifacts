# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array contains duplicate elements and the optimal strategy for Alice is to choose the smallest available number that will maximize the MEX of her array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only one element, which is 0. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the only available number, resulting in a MEX of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains two elements, 0 and 1. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smaller number (0) first, and then Bob will choose the larger number (1), resulting in a MEX of 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains three consecutive numbers, 0, 1, and 2. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest available number (0) first, and then Bob will choose the next smallest number (1), and finally Alice will choose the largest number (2), resulting in a MEX of 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains duplicate elements and the optimal strategy for Alice is to choose the smallest available number that will maximize the MEX of her array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains a large number of consecutive elements. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest available number (0) first, and then Bob will choose the next smallest number (1), and so on, resulting in a MEX of 10.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains a very large number of consecutive elements. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest available number (0) first, and then Bob will choose the next smallest number (1), and so on, resulting in a MEX of 200000.
