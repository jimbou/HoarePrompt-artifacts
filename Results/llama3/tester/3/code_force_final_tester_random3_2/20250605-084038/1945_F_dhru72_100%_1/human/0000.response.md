```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there is only one mushroom with a magic power of 1. The expected output is 1 1, indicating that the maximum strength of the elixir is 1, and the minimum number of mushrooms needed is 1.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
