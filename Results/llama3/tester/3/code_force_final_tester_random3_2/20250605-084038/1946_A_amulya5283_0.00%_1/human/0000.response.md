# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element by 1, the median becomes 3, which is the desired output.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the median is not the smallest element in the array. The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the second and third elements by 1, the median becomes 4, which is the desired output.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains a single element. The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing this element by 1, the median becomes 1000000001, which is the desired output.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the median is not unique in the array. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements by 1, the median becomes 6, which is the desired output.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains duplicate elements. The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements by 1, the median becomes 3, which is the desired output.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the input array contains only two elements. The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element by 1, the median becomes 2, which is the desired output.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains two identical elements. The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements by 1, the median becomes 2, which is the desired output.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the input array contains all identical elements. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements by 1, the median becomes 6, which is the desired output.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array is empty. The median of an empty array is undefined, so the function should return 0.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1
-1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the input array contains a negative number. The median of the array [-1000000000] is -1000000000. By increasing this element by 1, the median becomes -1000000001, which is the desired output.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains a zero. The median of the array [0] is 0. By increasing this element by 1, the median becomes 1, which is the desired output.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the input array contains the maximum possible integer value. The median of the array [2147483647] is 2147483647. By increasing this element by 1, the median becomes 2147483648, which is the desired output.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1
-2147483648
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains the minimum possible integer value. The median of the array [-2147483648] is -2147483648. By increasing this element by 1, the median becomes -2147483647, which is the desired output.
