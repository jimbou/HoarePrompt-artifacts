# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there is only one stick available, which is not enough to form any polygon.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that two sticks of the same length are not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are enough sticks to form a square (4 sticks of the same length).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that it is possible to form multiple polygons (a pentagon and a square) using the available sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all sticks have the same length, allowing for the formation of multiple polygons.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that sticks of different lengths cannot be used to form a polygon.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
8
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are enough sticks to form multiple polygons (two squares).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that three sticks of the same length can be used to form a triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are enough sticks to form a hexagon.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that four sticks of the same length can be used to form a square.
