# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a simple case where the desired configuration is achievable by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
11011
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies an unachievable configuration due to adjacent lamps being turned on.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This edge case tests the function's behavior when there is only one lamp, which cannot be turned on as per the problem's rules.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This edge case checks the function's response when there are only two lamps and both are turned on, which is not achievable as they are adjacent.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with the maximum number of lamps (50) and a configuration where no lamps are turned on, which is achievable.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's ability to handle the maximum number of lamps (50) with all lamps turned on, which is not achievable due to the adjacency constraint.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a small configuration where the desired state can be achieved by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior with a configuration where two adjacent lamps are turned on, making it unachievable.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with an alternating pattern of on and off lamps, which is achievable.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
20
11111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's response to a larger configuration where all lamps are turned on, which is not achievable due to the adjacency constraint.
