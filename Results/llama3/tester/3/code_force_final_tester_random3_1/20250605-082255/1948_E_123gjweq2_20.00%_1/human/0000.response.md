# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer (2 and 1), and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a slightly larger graph with n = 5 and k = 4. The expected output is a graph with five vertices, each assigned a distinct integer (3, 1, 5, 2, and 4), and two cliques: one containing vertices 1 and 2, and another containing vertices 3, 4, and 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a larger graph with n = 8 and k = 16. The expected output is a graph with eight vertices, each assigned a distinct integer (1 to 8), and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 4 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer (1 and 2), and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
40 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 40
20
1 1 2 2 3 3 ... 20 20
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where n = 40 and k = 2. The expected output is a graph with 40 vertices, each assigned a distinct integer (1 to 40), and 20 cliques, each containing two vertices.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge case where n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is a graph with a single vertex, assigned the integer 1, and a single clique containing that vertex.
