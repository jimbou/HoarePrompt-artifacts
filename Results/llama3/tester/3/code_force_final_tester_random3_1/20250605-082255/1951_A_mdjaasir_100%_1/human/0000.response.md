# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a simple case where the desired configuration is achievable by turning on two non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
11011
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a case where the desired configuration is not achievable because it requires turning on adjacent lamps.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle an edge case where there is only one lamp, and it's turned on.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle an edge case where there are only two lamps, and both are turned on.

11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a large input size with all lamps turned on.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a case where the desired configuration is achievable by turning on two non-adjacent lamps, with an even number of lamps.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1010101011
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a case where the desired configuration is not achievable because it requires turning on adjacent lamps, with an even number of lamps.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
11
10101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function can handle a case where the desired configuration is achievable by turning on two non-adjacent lamps, with an odd number of lamps.
