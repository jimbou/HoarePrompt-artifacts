# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [2, 4, 5] and t = [1, 3], resulting in a penalty of 3.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [8, 3, 1] and t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3], resulting in a penalty of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with identical elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [] and t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with a single element. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [] and t = [1], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with two elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [2] and t = [1], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle empty arrays. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [] and t = [], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with large elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [] and t = [2147483647], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
-2147483648
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with negative elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [] and t = [-2147483648], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with negative elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [-1] and t = [-1], resulting in a penalty of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with identical elements. The array is split into two subsequences, s and t, and the penalty is calculated as p(s) + p(t). In this case, s = [1] and t = [1], resulting in a penalty of 0.
