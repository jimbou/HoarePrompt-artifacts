# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
2
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. Alice has 7 coins and wants to buy 3 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the price for the stall should be 2, so Alice buys 3 jewels and is left with 1 coin.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks the edge case where it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels. Alice has 6 coins and wants to buy 4 jewels, but there is no way to set up the stalls to make this happen.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins is large. Alice has 255 coins and wants to buy 8 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the prices for the stalls should be 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, so Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins and the number of jewels are both 1. The code should output "YES" and the price for the stall should be 1, so Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins is very large. Alice has 10^18 coins and wants to buy 10^18 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the price for the stall should be 1, so Alice buys 10^18 jewels and is left with 0 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
2
2 5
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins is not a multiple of the number of jewels. Alice has 10 coins and wants to buy 5 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the prices for the stalls should be 2 and 5, so Alice buys 5 jewels and is left with 0 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1000000000000000000
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins is very large and the number of jewels is 1. Alice has 10^18 coins and wants to buy 1 jewel. The code should output "YES" and the price for the stall should be 10^18, so Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 10^18 - 1 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks the edge case where the number of coins is 1 and the number of jewels is very large. Alice has 1 coin and wants to buy 10^18 jewels. The code should output "NO" because it is impossible to set up the stalls to make this happen.
