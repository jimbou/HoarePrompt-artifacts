# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an array where all elements are the same. In this case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be -1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing one element (e.g., the last one) makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an array with only one element. In this case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be -1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing three elements (e.g., the first three) makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an array with only two elements that are the same. In this case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be -1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an array with a large number. In this case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be -1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... 1 (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a large array with all elements being the same. In this case, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be -1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 (150000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 3 ... 300000 (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. In this case, removing no elements makes the array not beautiful.
