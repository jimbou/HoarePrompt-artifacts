# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has two elements. The expected output is the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations required to achieve it.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has three elements and the maximum sum is already achieved without any operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has four elements and requires two operations to achieve the maximum sum.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only one element, which is 0. The expected output is the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations required to achieve it.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
324 17
1 1
2 2
3 3
...
18 18
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has the maximum possible length (18) and all elements are 0. The expected output is the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations required to achieve it.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
180000000 0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has the maximum possible length (18) and all elements are the maximum possible value (10^7). The expected output is the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations required to achieve it, which is 0 since the maximum sum is already achieved.
