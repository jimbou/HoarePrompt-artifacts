# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can correctly identify a template that matches strings a and b but not c when all strings have different characters.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
aaa
bbb
ccc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function returns "NO" when all strings have the same characters, making it impossible to find a template that matches a and b but not c.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
hello
world
horld
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to find a template that matches strings a and b but not c when there are some similarities between the strings.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where all strings are identical, making it impossible to find a distinguishing template.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
abcdefghij
klmnopqrst
abcdefghij
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with longer strings and verifies its ability to find a template that matches a and b but not c.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
z
y
z
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with strings containing the last letter of the alphabet and ensures it can find a template that distinguishes between a, b, and c.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
xyz
xyz
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's ability to find a template that matches a and b but not c when a and b are identical but different from c.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
aaaaa
bbbbb
ccccc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with strings consisting of repeated characters and ensures it can find a template that matches a and b but not c.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
ab
cd
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where a and c are identical but different from b, making it impossible to find a distinguishing template.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8
abcdefgh
ijklmnop
qrstuvwx
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with longer strings and verifies its ability to find a template that matches a and b but not c.
