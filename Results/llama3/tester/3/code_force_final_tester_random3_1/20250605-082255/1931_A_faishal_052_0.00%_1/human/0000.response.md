# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
24
```
**Output**: 
```
aav
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a single integer 24, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "aav".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
70
```
**Output**: 
```
rzz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a larger input. The input is a single integer 70, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "rzz".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a small input. The input is a single integer 3, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "aaa".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
55
```
**Output**: 
```
czz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a medium-sized input. The input is a single integer 55, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "czz".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
48
```
**Output**: 
```
auz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with another medium-sized input. The input is a single integer 48, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "auz".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
78
```
**Output**: 
```
zzz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the maximum possible input. The input is a single integer 78, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "zzz".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a duplicate input. The input is a single integer 3, which is the encoded word. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, which is "aaa".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input out of range
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an invalid input. The input is a single integer 0, which is outside the valid range of 3 to 78. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is out of range.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
79
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input out of range
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with another invalid input. The input is a single integer 79, which is outside the valid range of 3 to 78. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is out of range.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input is not an integer
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a non-integer input. The input is a string "abc", which is not a valid integer. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is not an integer.
