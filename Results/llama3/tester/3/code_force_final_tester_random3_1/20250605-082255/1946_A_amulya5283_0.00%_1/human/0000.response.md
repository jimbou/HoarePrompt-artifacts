# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element by 1, the median becomes 3, which is an increase.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple elements less than the median. The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the first two elements by 1, the median becomes 4, which is an increase.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large numbers. The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the element by 1, the median becomes 1000000001, which is an increase.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple elements equal to the median. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements by 1, the median becomes 6, which is an increase.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple elements less than the median. The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first two elements by 1, the median becomes 3, which is an increase.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with only two elements. The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element by 1, the median becomes 2, which is an increase.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with only two elements equal to the median. The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements by 1, the median becomes 2, which is an increase.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with all elements equal to the median. The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first three elements by 1, the median becomes 6, which is an increase.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle empty arrays. The median of an empty array is undefined, so the function should return 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with only one element. The median of the array [1] is 1. By increasing the element by 1, the median becomes 2, which is an increase.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle arrays with negative numbers. The median of the array [-1] is -1. By increasing the element by 1, the median becomes 0, which is an increase.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large numbers. The median of the array [2147483647] is 2147483647. By increasing the element by 1, the median becomes 2147483648, which is an increase.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
-2147483648
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large negative numbers. The median of the array [-2147483648] is -2147483648. By increasing the element by 1, the median becomes -2147483647, which is an increase.
