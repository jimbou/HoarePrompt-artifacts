# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array has 5 elements, and the maximum imbalance is 6 (between 20 and 26). By adding a new element with complexity 21 (16 + 5), the imbalance can be reduced to 5.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 6 5
1 4 7 10 18 21 22
2 3 5 7 4 2
6 8 9 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input array. The maximum imbalance is 8 (between 10 and 18), but by adding a new element with complexity 14 (7 + 7), the imbalance can be reduced to 4.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 6 5
1 4 7 10 18 21 22
2 3 5 7 4 2
6 8 13 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a slightly different input array. The maximum imbalance is 8 (between 10 and 18), but by adding a new element with complexity 15 (7 + 8), the imbalance can be reduced to 5.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 3
2 10 13 20 25
11 6 10 16 14 5
6 17 15
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a smaller input array. The maximum imbalance is 10 (between 13 and 23), but by adding a new element with complexity 18 (11 + 7), the imbalance can be reduced to 8.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
11 12 14 15
19 14
10 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a very small input array. The maximum imbalance is 3 (between 12 and 15), but by adding a new element with complexity 13 (11 + 2), the imbalance can be reduced to 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30
9 13 16 15
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input array with a smaller maximum imbalance. The maximum imbalance is 9 (between 21 and 30), but by adding a new element with complexity 25 (16 + 9), the imbalance can be reduced to 7.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7 6 5
2 4 7 10 18 21 22
4 21
4 15 14 5
20 1 15 1 12 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input array with a larger maximum imbalance. The maximum imbalance is 13 (between 10 and 23), but by adding a new element with complexity 18 (4 + 14), the imbalance can be reduced to 11.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a very small input array with only two elements. The maximum imbalance is 1 (between 1 and 2), and adding a new element with complexity 1 (1 + 0) does not change the imbalance.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 1000000000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a very large input array with a very large maximum imbalance. The maximum imbalance is 999999999 (between 1 and 1000000000), and adding a new element with complexity 1 (1 + 0) does not change the imbalance.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a very small input array with two identical elements. The maximum imbalance is 0 (between 1 and 1), and adding a new element with complexity 1 (1 + 0) does not change the imbalance.
