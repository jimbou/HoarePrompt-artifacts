# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where there is one 1, one 2, one 3, and no 4s. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there is one 1, no 2s, one 3, and two 4s. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there are two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, and no 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there are three 1s, three 2s, two 3s, and no 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there are no 1s, nine 2s, nine 3s, and nine 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there are no 1s, no 2s, no 3s, and no 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**: 
```
200
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there are 200 1s, 200 2s, 200 3s, and 200 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there is one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there are two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, and two 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where there are three 1s, three 2s, three 3s, and three 4s. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins.
