**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes four test cases with different grid sizes and arrow configurations. The first two test cases have a path to the target cell (2, n), while the third test case does not. The fourth test case has a more complex grid with multiple possible paths.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2

>>
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple grid with only two columns. The robot can move directly to the target cell (2, 2).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
<<
<<
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple grid with only two columns, but the arrows point to the left, making it impossible for the robot to reach the target cell (2, 2).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a grid with four columns, but the arrows form a cycle, making it impossible for the robot to reach the target cell (2, 4).

# Test 5

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a grid with six columns, but the arrows form a cycle, making it impossible for the robot to reach the target cell (2, 6).

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
<>
<>
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple grid with only two columns, and the arrows point in opposite directions. The robot can move to the target cell (2, 2) by moving down and then following the arrow.

# Test 7

**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple grid with only two columns, and the arrows point in opposite directions. The robot cannot move to the target cell (2, 2) because the arrows point away from the target.
