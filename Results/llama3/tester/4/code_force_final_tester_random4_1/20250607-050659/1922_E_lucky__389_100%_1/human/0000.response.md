# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a small input value (X = 2). The expected output is an array with a single element, 0, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing only the element 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a slightly larger input value (X = 5). The expected output is an array with three elements: 0, 1, and 0. This array has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, the subsequence containing only the element 0, the subsequence containing only the element 1, the subsequence containing both elements 0 and 1, and the subsequence containing all three elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input value (X = 13). The expected output is an array with five elements: 2, 2, 3, 4, and 2. This array has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a large input value (X = 37). The expected output is an array with seven elements: -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, and -1. This array has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is 1, which is not a valid input according to the problem description. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem description. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 0 increasing subsequences.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is the maximum allowed value (10^18). The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 10^18 increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is negative (-1), which is not a valid input according to the problem description. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly -1 increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2^64
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is larger than the maximum allowed value (2^64). The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 2^64 increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input value is a non-integer (1.5), which is not a valid input according to the problem description. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1.5 increasing subsequences.
