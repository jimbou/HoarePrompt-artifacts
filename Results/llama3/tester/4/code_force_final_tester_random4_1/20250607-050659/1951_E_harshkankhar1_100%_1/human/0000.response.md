# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
sinktheyacht
llllllllll
uwuowouwu
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
sinktheyacht
NO
YES
3
uw uow ouwu
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes three test cases: one where the input string is already a non-palindrome, one where the input string consists of all the same characters, and one where the input string can be partitioned into non-palindromes.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string is a single character. Since a single character is always a palindrome, the output should be "NO".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
ab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
ab
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string is a two-character string. Since a two-character string is not a palindrome, the output should be "YES" with a single partition.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
aaa
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string consists of all the same characters. Since any substring of this string is a palindrome, the output should be "NO".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
abcdefghij
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string is a long string with no repeated characters. Since this string is not a palindrome, the output should be "YES" with a single partition.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
ababababab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
2
ab abababab
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string consists of alternating characters. Since this string can be partitioned into non-palindromes, the output should be "YES" with two partitions.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
aaaaaaaaaaab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
2
aaaaaaaaaaa b
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string consists of a long sequence of the same character followed by a different character. Since this string can be partitioned into non-palindromes, the output should be "YES" with two partitions.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
abababababab
```
**Output**:
```
YES
3
ab ababab abab
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input string consists of alternating characters with an odd length. Since this string can be partitioned into non-palindromes, the output should be "YES" with three partitions.
