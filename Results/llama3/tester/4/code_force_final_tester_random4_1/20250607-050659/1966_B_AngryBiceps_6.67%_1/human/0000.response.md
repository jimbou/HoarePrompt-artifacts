# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to change the color of any square with an operation when there are only two squares of different colors.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can handle a larger grid and correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color after a sequence of operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a single square, which should always return YES since there's only one color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a small grid with all squares of the same color.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a grid with alternating colors.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can handle a grid with two distinct colors that are not alternating.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a grid that has a mix of colors and verifies that it correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a grid with a single row and a mix of colors, identifying that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
