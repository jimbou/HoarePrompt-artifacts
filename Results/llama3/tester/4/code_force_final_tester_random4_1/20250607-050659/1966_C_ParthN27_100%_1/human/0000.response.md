# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which will empty all of the piles at once.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there is a pile of size 1, so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the piles have different sizes. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will empty the smallest pile, and then Bob will be unable to make a move.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the piles have consecutive sizes. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will empty the smallest pile, and then Bob will be unable to make a move.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the piles have different sizes and some piles have the same size. Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there is a pile of size 1, so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=4.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the piles have different sizes and some piles have the same size. Alice can win by choosing k=2 on her first turn, which will empty the smallest pile, and then Bob will be unable to make a move.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there is only one pile with a large size. Alice can win by choosing k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty the pile at once.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Number of piles must be a positive integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of piles is 0. The function should return an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Number of piles must be a positive integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of piles is a negative integer. The function should return an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Pile size must be a positive integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the size of a pile is 0. The function should return an error message.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Pile size must be a positive integer.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the size of a pile is a negative integer. The function should return an error message.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Pile size must be at most 10^9.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the size of a pile exceeds the maximum allowed value. The function should return an error message.
