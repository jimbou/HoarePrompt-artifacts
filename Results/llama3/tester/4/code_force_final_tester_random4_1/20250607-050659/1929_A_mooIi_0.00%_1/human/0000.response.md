```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes five test cases with different array lengths and elements. The expected output is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where all elements in the array are the same. In this case, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array contains negative numbers. The maximum beauty of the array is still calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array has only one element. In this case, the maximum beauty of the array is 0.

```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array has a large number of elements. The maximum beauty of the array is still calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array contains very large numbers. The maximum beauty of the array is still calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

# Test 7

-1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array contains very large negative numbers. The maximum beauty of the array is still calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
