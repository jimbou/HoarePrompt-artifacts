# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array contains two 0s and two 1s. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, and finally Bob chooses 1. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0] is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the input array contains consecutive integers from 0 to 3. Alice should choose 0 first, then Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, and finally Bob chooses 3. The MEX of the resulting array [0, 2] is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input array contains only one element. Alice should choose 1, and then Bob chooses the remaining 1. The MEX of the resulting array [1] is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input array contains only one element, which is 0. Alice should choose 0, and then the game ends. The MEX of the resulting array [0] is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the input array contains two 0s, two 1s, and one 2. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, and finally Alice chooses 2. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2] is 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input array contains two pairs of identical elements. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, and finally Bob chooses 2. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2] is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the input array contains two 0s, two 1s, two 2s, and one 3. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 2, and finally Alice chooses 3. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2, 3] is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input array contains two pairs of identical elements and one additional element. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 2, Alice chooses 3, and finally Bob chooses 3. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2, 3] is 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the input array contains two 0s, two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, and one 4. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 2, Alice chooses 3, Bob chooses 3, and finally Alice chooses 4. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] is 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the input array contains two pairs of identical elements and two additional elements. Alice should choose 1 first, then Bob chooses 0, Alice chooses 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, Bob chooses 2, Alice chooses 3, Bob chooses 3, Alice chooses 4, and finally Bob chooses 4. The MEX of the resulting array [1, 0, 2, 3, 4] is 2.
