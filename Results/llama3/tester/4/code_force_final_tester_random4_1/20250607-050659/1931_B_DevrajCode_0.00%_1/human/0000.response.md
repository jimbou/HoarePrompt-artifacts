```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a single container with any amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function returns "NO" when it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a scenario where it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function returns "NO" when the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a scenario where it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same due to the large difference in water amounts.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a scenario where it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same despite the large difference in water amounts.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an empty container.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles two empty containers.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles three empty containers.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
100000
999999999 999999999 999999999 ... (100000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a large number of containers with a large amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
100000
1 1 1 ... (99999 times) 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a large number of containers with a small amount of water and one container with a large amount of water.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
100000
999999999 1 1 ... (99999 times)
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a large number of containers with a small amount of water and one container with a large amount of water.
