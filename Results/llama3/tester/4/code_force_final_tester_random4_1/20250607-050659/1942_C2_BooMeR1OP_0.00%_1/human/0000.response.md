7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
6

2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4) and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the maximum allowed (10^9) and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5), but no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd (7) and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices (3).

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even (8) and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (4).

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 3
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (5) and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2), but additional vertices can be chosen (y = 3).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even (10) and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (5), but no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
9 4 1
1 3 6 8
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd (9) and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (4).

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 2
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even (6) and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices (3).

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1 999999999
1
```
**Output**:
```
499999999
```
**Description**: This test case tests the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the maximum allowed (10^9) and Bessie has chosen only one vertex, but a large number of additional vertices can be chosen (y = 999999999).
