# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("a") is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
b
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "a". The expected output is "NO" because the string "b" is not a subsequence of "a".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
aa
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet occur as a subsequence of "aa". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("aa") is a subsequence of "aa".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "ab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "ab".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abc". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aaa" is not a subsequence of "abc".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
abcd
```
**Output**:

**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 4 that can be formed using the first 4 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of "abcd". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aaaa" is not a subsequence of "abcd".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
abcde
```
**Output**:
