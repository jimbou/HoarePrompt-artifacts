**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It includes five test cases with different permutations and target values. The first test case has a sorted permutation, the second test case has a permutation that requires one swap to sort, the third test case has a permutation that requires two swaps to sort, and the last two test cases have permutations that require two swaps to sort.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has only one element.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has only two elements and the target value is the first element.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has only two elements and the target value is the second element.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
200000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements and the target value is the last element.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements and the target value is the first element.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
100000 100001 ... 200000 1 ... 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
100000 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements and the target value is in the middle of the permutation.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
1 2 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
199999 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements and the target value is the last element, but the permutation is almost sorted.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
200000 1 2 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements and the target value is the first element, but the permutation is almost sorted.
