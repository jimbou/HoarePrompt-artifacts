# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the simplest case where the strings have only one character. The function should return "YES" because the template "C" can be used to match strings "a" and "b" but not "c".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
bb
aa

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle longer strings. The function should return "YES" because the template "CODEforces" can be used to match strings "mathforces" and "luckforces" but not "adhoccoder".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the case where the strings have different characters in the same positions. The function should return "NO" because there is no template that can match strings "acc" and "abd" but not "abc".

# Test 5

```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**:

```
1
1
a
b
a

```
1
20

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
b
```
**Output**: 
```
