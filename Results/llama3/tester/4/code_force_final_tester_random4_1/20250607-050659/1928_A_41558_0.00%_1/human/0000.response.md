# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a square (1x1). According to the problem description, a square cannot be cut into two rectangles, so the output should be "No".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x1 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the output should be "No".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x6 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 3x2 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x2 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x4 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a 6x3 rectangle. According to the problem description, a 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 6x1 rectangles or two 3x3 rectangles, but neither of these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the output should be "No".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a large square (1000000000x1000000000). According to the problem description, a large square can be cut into two smaller rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a very long and thin rectangle (1x1000000000). According to the problem description, a very long and thin rectangle can only be cut into two smaller rectangles of the same width, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the output should be "No".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input rectangle is a very long and thin rectangle (1000000000x1). According to the problem description, a very long and thin rectangle can only be cut into two smaller rectangles of the same width, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle, so the output should be "No".
