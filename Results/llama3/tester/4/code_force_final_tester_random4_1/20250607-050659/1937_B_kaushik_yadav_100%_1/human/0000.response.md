**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes three test cases with different grid sizes and binary strings. The first test case has a grid size of 2x2 with all zeros, the second test case has a grid size of 4x2 with a mix of zeros and ones, and the third test case has a grid size of 8x2 with a mix of zeros and ones.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
11
```
**Output**: 
```
111
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where all elements in the grid are ones. The lexicographically smallest string is "111" and there is only one path that yields this string.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
00
11
```
**Output**: 
```
001
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the first row has all zeros and the second row has all ones. The lexicographically smallest string is "001" and there are two paths that yield this string.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10
01
```
**Output**: 
```
100
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the first row has a mix of zeros and ones and the second row has a mix of zeros and ones. The lexicographically smallest string is "100" and there are two paths that yield this string.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 1x2 with all zeros. The lexicographically smallest string is "0" and there is only one path that yields this string.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 1x2 with all ones. The lexicographically smallest string is "1" and there is only one path that yields this string.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**: 
```
 
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 0x2. This is an edge case where the input is invalid.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
 
 
```
**Output**: 
```
 
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 2x2 but the binary strings are empty. This is an edge case where the input is invalid.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
00
```
**Output**: 
```
 
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 2x2 but only one binary string is provided. This is an edge case where the input is invalid.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
00
00
00
```
**Output**: 
```
 
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the grid size is 2x2 but three binary strings are provided. This is an edge case where the input is invalid.
