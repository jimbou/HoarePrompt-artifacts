```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers a larger graph with n = 8 and k = 16. The expected output is a graph with eight vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge case where n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
1
1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers another edge case where n = 3 and k = 2. The expected output is a graph with three vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

**Input**: 
```
1
40 80
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 40
1
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers a large graph with n = 40 and k = 80. The expected output is a graph with 40 vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge case where n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is a graph with a single vertex, assigned the integer 1, and a single clique containing that vertex.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers another edge case where n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers a small graph with n = 4 and k = 4. The expected output is a graph with four vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 10
1
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Description**: This test case covers a medium-sized graph with n = 10 and k = 20. The expected output is a graph with 10 vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.
