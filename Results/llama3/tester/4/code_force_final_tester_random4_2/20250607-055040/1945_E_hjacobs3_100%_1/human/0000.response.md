# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input array is already sorted and the target element is in its correct position.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function can correctly identify the need for one swap operation to bring the target element to its correct position.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where two swap operations are required to bring the target element to its correct position.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the target element is not in its correct position and two swap operations are necessary.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle small input arrays and identify the need for one swap operation.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior with a single-element input array.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a two-element input array and identify the need for one swap operation.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a two-element input array where the target element is at the beginning.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1
200000 199999 199998 ... 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2 200000
1 200000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large input arrays and identify the need for two swap operations.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior with a large input array where the target element is already in its correct position.
