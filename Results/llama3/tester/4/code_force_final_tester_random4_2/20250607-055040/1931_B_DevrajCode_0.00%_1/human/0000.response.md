# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a single container with any amount of water. Since there's only one container, it's always possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 43 units).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle two containers with different amounts of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (1+3=4, 4/2=2), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (4+5+2+1+3=15, 15/5=3), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 3 units).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (1+2+3=6, 6/3=2), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (4+5+5+0+6+4+4=28, 28/7=4), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (6+5+5+1+3+4+4=28, 28/7=4), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 4 units).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a single container with zero water. Since there's only one container, it's always possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 0 units).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with zero water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (0+0=0, 0/2=0), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 0 units).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle multiple containers with zero water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (0+0+0=0, 0/3=0), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 0 units).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
100000
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with the same amount of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (1+1+...+1=100000, 100000/100000=1), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 1 unit).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
100000
0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with zero water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (0+0+...+0=0, 0/100000=0), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 0 units).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
100000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with a large amount of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers (1000000000+1000000000+...+1000000000=100000000000000, 100000000000000/100000=1000000000), it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, 1000000000 units).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
100000
-1 -1 -1 ... -1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with negative water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (-1-1-...-1=-100000, -100000/100000=-1), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

-1000000000 -1000000000 ... -1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with a large negative amount of water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (-1000000000-1000000000-...-1000000000=-100000000000000, -100000000000000/100000=-1000000000), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with a mix of positive and negative water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (1+1+...+1-1000000000=-999999000, -999999000/100000=-9999), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

# Test 16

**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a large number of containers with a mix of large positive and negative water. Since the sum of the water in the containers is not divisible by the number of containers (1000000000+1000000000+...+1000000000-1000000000=99999900000000, 99999900000000/100000=999999000), it's not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
