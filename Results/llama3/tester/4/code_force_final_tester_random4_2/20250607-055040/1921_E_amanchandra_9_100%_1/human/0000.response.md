# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (2, 2) and Bob's chip is at position (5, 3). Alice can move her chip to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3), and Bob can move his chip to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4). Alice can win by moving her chip to (3, 2) and then to (4, 2), capturing Bob's chip.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (2, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (4, 1). Alice can move her chip to (3, 1), and Bob can move his chip to (3, 1), capturing Alice's chip.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has only one row. Alice's chip is at position (1, 3) and Bob's chip is at position (1, 1). Since the board has only one row, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chips, resulting in a draw.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has an odd number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at position (1, 4) and Bob's chip is at position (5, 2). Since the board has an odd number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can capture the other's chip, resulting in a draw.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has an even number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at position (1, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (4, 4). Since the board has an even number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can capture the other's chip, resulting in a draw.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (1, 6) and Bob's chip is at position (10, 8). Alice can move her chip to (2, 6), (2, 5), or (2, 7), and Bob can move his chip to (9, 8), (9, 7), or (9, 9). Alice can win by moving her chip to (2, 6) and then to (3, 6), capturing Bob's chip.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at position (2, 6) and Bob's chip is at position (10, 7). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can capture the other's chip, resulting in a draw.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at position (9, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (8, 1). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can capture the other's chip, resulting in a draw.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (8, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (10, 2). Alice can move her chip to (9, 1), and Bob can move his chip to (9, 2), capturing Alice's chip.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (1, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (2, 1). Alice can move her chip to (2, 1), capturing Bob's chip.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. Alice's chip is at position (1, 3) and Bob's chip is at position (4, 1). Alice can move her chip to (2, 3), (2, 2), or (2, 4), and Bob can move his chip to (3, 1), (3, 0), or (3, 2). Alice can win by moving her chip to (2, 3) and then to (3, 3), capturing Bob's chip.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the functionality of the `has_close_elements` function when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at position (3, 1) and Bob's chip is at position (1, 1). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can capture the other's chip, resulting in a draw.
