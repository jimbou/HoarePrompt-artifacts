# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only element, and Bob has no elements to multiply by -1.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+1+2-4=2.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes all elements, and Bob has no elements to multiply by -1.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest element (32). Bob multiplies the next largest element (15) by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+7+3+3-15=1. However, since Alice can remove at most k elements, she removes the next largest element (7), resulting in a sum of 3+3+3-15=-6. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+3-3-15=-12. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the two largest elements (32 and 15), resulting in a sum of 3+7+3+3=16. Then, Bob multiplies the next largest element (7) by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+3+3-7=2. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+3-3-7=-4. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the three largest elements (32, 15, and 7), resulting in a sum of 3+3+3=9. Then, Bob multiplies the next largest element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of 3+3-3=3.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
**Output**:
```
-5
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the two largest elements (9 and 9). Bob multiplies the next three largest elements (5, 5, and 3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
10 6 4
1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200
```
**Output**:
```
-9
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest element (200). Bob multiplies the next four largest elements (9, 9, 8, and 5) by -1, resulting in a sum of -9-9-8-5+3+3+3+2+1=-24. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the two largest elements (200 and 9), resulting in a sum of 1+8+2+3+3+4+5+3=29. Then, Bob multiplies the next four largest elements (9, 8, 5, and 4) by -1, resulting in a sum of -9-8-5-4+3+3+3+2+1=-14. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -9-8-5-4+3+3-3+2+1=-21. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the three largest elements (200, 9, and 9), resulting in a sum of 1+8+2+3+3+4+5+3=29. Then, Bob multiplies the next four largest elements (8, 5, 4, and 3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -8-5-4-3+3+3+2+1=-11. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -8-5-4-3+3+3-3+2+1=-18. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the four largest elements (200, 9, 9, and 8), resulting in a sum of 1+2+3+3+4+5+3=21. Then, Bob multiplies the next four largest elements (5, 4, 3, and 3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -5-4-3-3+3+3+2+1=-6. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -5-4-3-3+3+3-3+2+1=-13. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the five largest elements (200, 9, 9, 8, and 5), resulting in a sum of 1+2+3+3+4+3=16. Then, Bob multiplies the next four largest elements (4, 3, 3, and 2) by -1, resulting in a sum of -4-3-3-2+3+3+1=-5. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the largest remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -4-3-3-2+3+3-3+1=-9.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
2 2 1
4 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the largest element (4). Bob multiplies the remaining element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -3.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
2 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies the largest element (3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -3+1=-2. But since Bob can multiply at most x elements by -1, he multiplies the remaining element (1) by -1, resulting in a sum of -3-1=-4. However, this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is for Alice to remove the largest element (3), resulting in a sum of 1. Then, Bob multiplies the remaining element (1) by -1, resulting in a sum of -1.
