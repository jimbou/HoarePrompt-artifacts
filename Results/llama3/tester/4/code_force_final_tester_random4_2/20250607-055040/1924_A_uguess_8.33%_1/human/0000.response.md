abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
b
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "a". Since "b" is not a subsequence of "a", the output is "NO" followed by the string "b".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

2 2 2
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "ab". Since "aa" is not a subsequence of "ab", the output is "NO" followed by the string "aa".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abc". Since "aaa" is not a subsequence of "abc", the output is "NO" followed by the string "aaa".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4
abcd
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aaaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 4 that can be formed using the first 4 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string "abcd". Since "aaaa" is not a subsequence of "abcd", the output is "NO" followed by the string "aaaa".

# Test 10
