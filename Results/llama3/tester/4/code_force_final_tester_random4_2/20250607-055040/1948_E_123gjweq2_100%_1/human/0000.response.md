# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
This test case covers a slightly larger graph with n = 5 and k = 4. The expected output is a graph with five vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and two cliques, each containing two or three vertices.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This test case covers a larger graph with n = 8 and k = 16. The expected output is a graph with eight vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all eight vertices.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
This test case covers an edge case where n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is a graph with two vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing both vertices.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
40 2
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to 40]
[minimum number of cliques]
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers an edge case where n = 40 and k = 2. The expected output is a graph with 40 vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and the minimum possible number of cliques.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2n
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to n]
1
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers an edge case where n = 2 and k = 2n. The expected output is a graph with n vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
n 1
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to n]
n
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers an edge case where k = 1. The expected output is a graph with n vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and n cliques, each containing a single vertex.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
n n
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to n]
1
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers an edge case where k = n. The expected output is a graph with n vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
n 2n
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to n]
1
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers an edge case where k = 2n. The expected output is a graph with n vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and a single clique containing all vertices.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
n k (where k is not a multiple of n)
```
**Output**: 
```
[distinct integers from 1 to n]
[minimum number of cliques]
[clique assignments for each vertex]
```
This test case covers a scenario where k is not a multiple of n. The expected output is a graph with n vertices, each assigned a distinct integer, and the minimum possible number of cliques.
