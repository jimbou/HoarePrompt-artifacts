**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the code. It includes six test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for both installations is the same and the time the firework is visible in the sky is also the same.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with extremely large input values.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for both installations is the same and the time the firework is visible in the sky is extremely large.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is extremely large and the time the firework is visible in the sky is the same.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is the same and the time the firework is visible in the sky is extremely large.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with extremely large input values for all parameters.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the time the firework is visible in the sky is zero.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is zero, which is an invalid input.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is zero, which is an invalid input.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the time the firework is visible in the sky is negative, which is an invalid input.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is negative, which is an invalid input.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 -1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the frequency of launching for one installation is negative, which is an invalid input.
