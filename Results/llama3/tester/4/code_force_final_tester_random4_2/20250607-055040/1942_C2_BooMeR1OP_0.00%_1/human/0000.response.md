**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints. The output should match the expected results provided in the problem description.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4), and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2). The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is also at its maximum (2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's performance when the number of sides of the polygon is at its maximum (10^9), and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5). The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0, which should result in no additional triangular pieces.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is an odd number (7), and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices (3). The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is an even number (8), and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (4). The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1 999999
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's performance when the number of sides of the polygon is at its maximum (10^9), and Bessie has chosen only 1 vertex. The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is at its maximum (n - x), but since x is 1, no additional triangular pieces can be formed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4), and Bessie has chosen 2 adjacent vertices. The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is an odd number (7), and Bessie has chosen 3 adjacent vertices. The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is an even number (8), and Bessie has chosen 4 non-adjacent vertices. The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 3 5 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's performance when the number of sides of the polygon is at its maximum (10^9), and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5) in a non-adjacent pattern. The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0, which should result in no additional triangular pieces.
