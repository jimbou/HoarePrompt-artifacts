# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to change the color of any square with an operation when there are only two rows and one column.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function can handle a larger grid and correctly determines that it's possible to make all squares the same color after a sequence of operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a grid of size 1x1, where the single square is already the same color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that all squares are already the same color in a 2x2 grid.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a grid where the colors alternate in a pattern.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that all squares can be made the same color in a grid with alternating colors.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a grid where it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color in a grid with a single row and alternating colors.
