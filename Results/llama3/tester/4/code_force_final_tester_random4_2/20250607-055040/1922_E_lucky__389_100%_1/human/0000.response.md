# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input is a small number (2). The expected output is an array with a single element (0), which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing only the element 0).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a slightly larger number (5). The expected output is an array with three elements (0, 1, 0), which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a moderate-sized number (13). The expected output is an array with five elements (2, 2, 3, 4, 2), which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a larger number (37). The expected output is an array with seven elements (-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1), which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 1, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 0 increasing subsequences.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
200
... (an array of 200 elements)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the maximum allowed value (10^18). The expected output is an array with 200 elements, which has exactly 10^18 increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 + 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is larger than the maximum allowed value (10^18). The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 10^18 + 1 increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1000
2
5
13
37
...
```
**Output**: 
```
... (1000 outputs, each corresponding to the input)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a large number of test cases. The expected output is a large number of arrays, each corresponding to the input and having the correct number of increasing subsequences.
