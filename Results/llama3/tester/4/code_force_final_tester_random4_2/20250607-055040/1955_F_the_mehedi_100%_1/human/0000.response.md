```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is one 1, one 3, and two 4s in the sequence. Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, resulting in a sequence with only two 4s, which means Bob wins.

**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s in the sequence. Eve can remove one 1, one 2, and one 3, resulting in a sequence with only one 1, one 2, and one 3, which means Bob wins.

```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the sequence contains the maximum number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Eve can remove 100 numbers of each type, resulting in a sequence with only 100 numbers of each type, which means Bob wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one 1 in the sequence. Since there are no other numbers to remove, Bob cannot win.
