# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
7 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. Alice has 7 coins and Bob wants her to buy 3 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the price per jewel for the first stall, which is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. Alice has 6 coins and Bob wants her to buy 4 jewels, but there is no way to set up the stalls to achieve this.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
255 8
```
**Output**:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has a large number of coins and Bob wants her to buy a large number of jewels. The code should output "YES" and the prices per jewel for each stall.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has only 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy only 1 jewel. The code should output "YES" and the price per jewel for the first stall, which is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has a very large number of coins and Bob wants her to buy the same number of jewels. The code should output "YES" and the price per jewel for the first stall, which is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has no coins and Bob wants her to buy 1 jewel. The code should output "NO" because it is impossible for Alice to buy any jewels.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has 1 coin and Bob wants her to buy 0 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the number of stalls, which is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000000000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has a very large number of coins and Bob wants her to buy 0 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the number of stalls, which is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has no coins and Bob wants her to buy 0 jewels. The code should output "YES" and the number of stalls, which is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
2
7 3
6 4
```
**Output**:
```
YES
1
2
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple test cases. The code should output the results for each test case separately.
