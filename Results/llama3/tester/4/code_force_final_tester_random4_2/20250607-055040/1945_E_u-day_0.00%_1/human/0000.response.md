# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a scenario where the target element is already in its correct position in the sorted array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies if the function can correctly identify the need for one swap operation to place the target element in its correct position.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a scenario where two swap operations are necessary to place the target element in its correct position.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance when the target element is not in its correct position and requires two swap operations to be placed correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the target element is in the first position of the array and requires one swap operation to be placed correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's handling of an array with a single element.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle an array with two elements where the target element is not in its correct position.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's handling of an array with two elements where the target element is already in its correct position.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the target element is already in its correct position in an array with three elements.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
2 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's performance when the target element is in the last position of an array with three elements and requires two swap operations to be placed correctly.
