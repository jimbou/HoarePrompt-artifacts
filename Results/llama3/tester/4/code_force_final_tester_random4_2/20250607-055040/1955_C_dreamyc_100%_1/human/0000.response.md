# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. It simulates the Kraken's attack on 4 ships with different durability values. The expected output is 2, as two ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is greater than the number of ships. The expected output is 3, as three ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is much greater than the number of ships. The expected output is 5, as all ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is less than the number of ships. The expected output is 0, as no ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is much greater than the number of ships, and the durability of the ships is very different. The expected output is 2, as both ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 7
5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is greater than the number of ships, and the durability of the ships is very different. The expected output is 2, as both ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there is only one ship. The expected output is 1, as the ship will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there is only one ship and the number of attacks is greater than the durability of the ship. The expected output is 1, as the ship will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of attacks is extremely large. The expected output is 1, as the ship will sink after the Kraken's attack.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000000000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of ships is extremely large and the number of attacks is also extremely large. The expected output is 100000, as all ships will sink after the Kraken's attack.
