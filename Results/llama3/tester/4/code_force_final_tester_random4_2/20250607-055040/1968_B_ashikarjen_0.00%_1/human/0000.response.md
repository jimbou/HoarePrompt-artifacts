# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
10011
1110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The first two characters of string a ('10') are a subsequence of string b ('1110'), but the third character ('0') is not. Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the strings are of equal length. The first two characters of string a ('10') are a subsequence of string b ('110'), but the third character ('0') is not. Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3
1
111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string a is a single character. The single character '1' is a subsequence of string b ('111'). Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1011
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string a contains multiple '1's. The first character '1' is a subsequence of string b ('1111'), but the second character '0' is not. Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
100
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string b is longer than string a. The entire string a ('100') is a subsequence of string b ('11010'). Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 3.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
100
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string b does not contain any '1's. None of the characters in string a ('100') are a subsequence of string b ('0'). Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
 
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both strings are empty. There are no characters to compare, so the maximum possible number k is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
1
 
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string b is empty. There are no characters in string b to compare with string a ('1'), so the maximum possible number k is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
 
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string a is empty. There are no characters in string a to compare with string b ('1'), so the maximum possible number k is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
00
11
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when string a contains only '0's and string b contains only '1's. None of the characters in string a ('00') are a subsequence of string b ('11'). Therefore, the maximum possible number k is 0.
