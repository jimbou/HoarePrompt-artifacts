# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3
000
111
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
This test case checks the scenario where the initial state has no cats and the desired state has cats in all boxes. The function should return 3, which is the minimum number of operations required to place a cat in each box.

# Test 4

```
1
4
0101
1010
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
This test case checks the scenario where the initial state has cats in some boxes and the desired state has cats in different boxes. The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the cats to the correct boxes.

1
3
100
101
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

```
**Output**:
```
4
```
This test case checks the scenario where the initial state has cats in some boxes and the desired state has cats in all boxes. The function should return 4, which is the minimum number of operations required to place cats in the remaining boxes.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input is empty. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.
