**Output**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has only one node. The function should return 1 as the minimum number of operations needed to color all vertices black, and the operation should be to color the only node black with distance 0.

# Test 2

```
**Output**:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has two nodes connected by an edge. The function should return 2 as the minimum number of operations needed to color all vertices black, and the operations should be to color each node black with distance 1.
