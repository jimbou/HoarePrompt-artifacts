# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the lower bound (5) is greater than the upper bound (4), resulting in no possible integers k that satisfy the constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the lower and upper bounds are equal, resulting in only one possible integer k that satisfies the constraints.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 3
2 10
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple constraints, including a "not equal to" constraint, and verifies that the correct number of possible integers k is returned.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the bounds are very large numbers, and verifies that the correct number of possible integers k is returned.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple "not equal to" constraints that cover all possible integers between the lower and upper bounds, resulting in no possible integers k that satisfy the constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where there are multiple constraints, including overlapping bounds and "not equal to" constraints, resulting in no possible integers k that satisfy the constraints.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where there are multiple constraints, including very large numbers and overlapping bounds, and verifies that the correct number of possible integers k is returned.
