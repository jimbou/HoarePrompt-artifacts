# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen 2 vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 8, and Bessie has chosen 4 vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 8, and Bessie has chosen all 8 vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 6.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen 2 adjacent vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen 2 opposite vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
?
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is very large (1,000,000), and Bessie has chosen a large number of vertices (200,000). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is unknown and requires a robust solution.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen only 1 vertex (which is invalid). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen a vertex with an invalid index (0). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen a vertex with an invalid index (5). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
0 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is invalid (0), and Bessie has chosen 2 vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
4 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has not chosen any vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is 0.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
?
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, and she can choose 1 more vertex. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out is unknown and requires a robust solution.
