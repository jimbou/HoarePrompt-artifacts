# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The strings "a" and "b" match the template "C" (since 'a' and 'b' are different from 'c'), while the string "c" does not match.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
bb
aa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have the same character at a position, but the string "c" has the same character at that position. In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at some positions, and the string "c" has different characters at those positions. In this case, a template can be constructed to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have the same character at some positions, and the string "c" has different characters at those positions. In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all three strings are the same. In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" are different, and the string "c" is the same as "a". In this case, a template can be constructed to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuv
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at some positions, and the string "c" has the same characters at those positions. In this case, a template can be constructed to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all three strings are the same. In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuv
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" are the same, and the string "c" is different from "a". In this case, a template can be constructed to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuv
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" are different, and the string "c" is the same as "a". In this case, a template can be constructed to distinguish between "a" and "c".
