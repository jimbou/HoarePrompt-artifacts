# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
sinktheyacht
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
sinktheyacht
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The input string "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so the code should output "YES" and the same string as the partition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
lllllllll
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string consists of the same character repeated multiple times. In this case, any substring of the string is a palindrome, so the code should output "NO".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
uwuowouwu
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
3
uw uow ouwu
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a string that can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. The code should output "YES" and a valid partition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string is a single character. Since a single character is always a palindrome, the code should output "NO".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
ab
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a string that is not a palindrome. The code should output "YES" and the same string as the partition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
abcba
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string is a palindrome. Since any substring of a palindrome is also a palindrome, the code should output "NO".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
abcdefghij
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
abcdefghij
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a long string that is not a palindrome. The code should output "YES" and the same string as the partition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
aaaaaaaaaa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the input string consists of the same character repeated multiple times. In this case, any substring of the string is a palindrome, so the code should output "NO".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
abcdefghija
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
abcdefghija
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a long string that is not a palindrome. The code should output "YES" and the same string as the partition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
abcdefghijab
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
abcdefghijab
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code with a long string that is not a palindrome. The code should output "YES" and the same string as the partition.
