# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. With one 1, one 2, and one 3, the XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one number to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins once.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, there is one 1, one 3, and two 4s. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins once.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple pairs of numbers with the same value. With two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s, the XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins. Eve can remove one number from each pair to make the XOR non-zero, and Alice wins three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, there are three 1s, three 2s, and two 3s. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one number from each pair to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins three times.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are many numbers with the same value. With nine 2s, nine 3s, and nine 4s, the XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins. Eve can remove one number from each group to make the XOR non-zero, and Alice wins twelve times.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge scenario where there are no numbers in the sequence. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins zero times.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, there are 200 ones and no other numbers. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one number at a time to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins 100 times.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are 200 twos and no other numbers. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins. Eve can remove one number at a time to make the XOR non-zero, and Alice wins 100 times.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, there are 200 threes and no other numbers. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero, so Alice wins. Eve can remove one number at a time to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins 100 times.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are 200 fours and no other numbers. The XOR of all numbers is zero, so Bob wins. Eve can remove one number at a time to make the XOR non-zero, and Alice wins 100 times.
