```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the game lasts for a longer duration (8 turns). Sasha's starting position is 10, and Bodya's starting position is 2. After 8 turns, Sasha's score is higher, so Sasha wins.

```
**Output**: 
```
Bodya
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the permutation array has repeated elements. Bodya's starting position is 4, and Sasha's starting position is 1. After 10 turns, Bodya's score is higher, so Bodya wins.

```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the game lasts for a short duration (2 turns). Both players' starting positions are 3 and 1, respectively. After 2 turns, both players' scores are equal, resulting in a draw.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1 3 5 2 4
6 9 8 9 5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the array has large values. Sasha's starting position is 1, and Bodya's starting position is 3. After 1 turn, Sasha's score is higher, so Sasha wins.

# Test 7

```
1
4 8 4 2
2 3 4 1
5 2 8 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the game lasts for a moderate duration (8 turns). Sasha's starting position is 4, and Bodya's starting position is 2. After 8 turns, Sasha's score is higher, so Sasha wins.
