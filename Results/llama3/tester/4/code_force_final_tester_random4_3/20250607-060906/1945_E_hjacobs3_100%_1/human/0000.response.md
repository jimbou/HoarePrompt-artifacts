# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is already sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is not sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 1, indicating one operation is needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is not sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 2, indicating two operations are needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is not sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 2, indicating two operations are needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is not sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 1, indicating one operation is needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only one element, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only two elements, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 1, indicating one operation is needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only two elements, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is already sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array is not sorted, and the target element is present in the array. The function should return 1, indicating one operation is needed, and provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.
