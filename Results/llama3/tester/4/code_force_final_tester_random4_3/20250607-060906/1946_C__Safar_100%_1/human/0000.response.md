**Description**: This test case checks the functionality of the function with a larger tree and more edges to be removed. The tree has 6 vertices and 2 edges to be removed. The expected output is 2, which means the size of each remaining connected component is at least 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of vertices is 1 and 0 edges are to be removed. The expected output is 1, which means the size of each remaining connected component is at least 1.

# Test 8
