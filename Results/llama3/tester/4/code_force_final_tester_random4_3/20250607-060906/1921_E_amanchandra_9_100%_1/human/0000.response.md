# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (2, 2) and Bob's chip is at (5, 3). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Alice can win by moving her chip to (5, 3).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (2, 1) and Bob's chip is at (4, 1). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Bob can win by moving his chip to (2, 1).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has only one row. Alice's chip is at (1, 3) and Bob's chip is at (1, 1). Since the board has only one row, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip. The game ends in a draw.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has an odd number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at (1, 4) and Bob's chip is at (5, 2). Since the board has an odd number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip to the other's position. The game ends in a draw.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has an even number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at (1, 1) and Bob's chip is at (4, 4). Since the board has an even number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip to the other's position. The game ends in a draw.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (1, 6) and Bob's chip is at (10, 8). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Alice can win by moving her chip to (10, 8).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at (2, 6) and Bob's chip is at (10, 7). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip to the other's position. The game ends in a draw.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at (9, 1) and Bob's chip is at (8, 1). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip to the other's position. The game ends in a draw.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (8, 1) and Bob's chip is at (10, 2). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Bob can win by moving his chip to (8, 1).

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (1, 1) and Bob's chip is at (2, 1). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Alice can win by moving her chip to (2, 1).

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Description**: Basic test case to verify the fundamental functionality of the function. Alice's chip is at (1, 3) and Bob's chip is at (4, 1). Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right. Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right. Alice can win by moving her chip to (4, 1).

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Draw
```
**Description**: Edge test case to verify the function's behavior when the board has a large number of rows and columns. Alice's chip is at (3, 1) and Bob's chip is at (1, 1). Since the board has a large number of rows and columns, neither Alice nor Bob can move their chip to the other's position. The game ends in a draw.
