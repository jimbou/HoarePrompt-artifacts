# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
4
3
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with two test cases. The first test case has n = 4, and the function should return a permutation that satisfies the condition. The second test case has n = 3, and the function should return a permutation that satisfies the condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000 1 2 3 ... 99999
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a large input value (n = 100000). The function should return a permutation that satisfies the condition.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3
3
4
5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
4 1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with multiple test cases. The first test case has n = 3, the second test case has n = 4, and the third test case has n = 5. The function should return permutations that satisfy the condition for each test case.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the minimum possible input value (n = 3). The function should return a permutation that satisfies the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
3
4
5
6
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
4 1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with multiple test cases. The first test case has n = 3, the second test case has n = 4, the third test case has n = 5, the fourth test case has n = 6, and the fifth test case has n = 7. The function should return permutations that satisfy the condition for each test case.
