```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input numbers are the same. The input numbers are 1111 and 1111, and the expected output is 1111 and 1111, which is the maximum product that can be obtained by swapping the digits.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1234
4321
```
**Output**: 
```
4231
1324
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
9999
1111
```
**Output**: 
```
9911
1199
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input numbers are at the extreme ends of the range (i.e., 9999 and 1111). The input numbers are 9999 and 1111, and the expected output is 9911 and 1199, which is the maximum product that can be obtained by swapping the digits.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
1000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input numbers are at the boundary of the range (i.e., 1000). The input numbers are 1000 and 1000, and the expected output is 1000 and 1000, which is the maximum product that can be obtained by swapping the digits.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
123456789
987654321
```
**Output**: 
```
987654321
123456789
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input numbers are large. The input numbers are 123456789 and 987654321, and the expected output is 987654321 and 123456789, which is the maximum product that can be obtained by swapping the digits.
