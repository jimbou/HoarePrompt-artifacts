1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a simple case where the number of cards is 5 and the exchange rate is 3. The expected output is 2, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 1 and the exchange rate is 10. In this case, no operations can be performed, so the expected output is 1.

```
1
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 7 and the exchange rate is 2. In this case, the function should return 1, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 10 and the exchange rate is 4. In this case, the function should return 5, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 5 and the exchange rate is 2. In this case, the function should return 1, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 6 and the exchange rate is 2. In this case, the function should return 6, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 6 and the exchange rate is 3. In this case, the function should return 6, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 0 and the exchange rate is 3. In this case, the function should return 0, which is the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Exchange rate cannot be 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 5 and the exchange rate is 0. In this case, the function should return an error message, as the exchange rate cannot be 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 -3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Exchange rate cannot be negative
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cards is 5 and the exchange rate is -3. In this case, the function should return an error message, as the exchange rate cannot be negative.
