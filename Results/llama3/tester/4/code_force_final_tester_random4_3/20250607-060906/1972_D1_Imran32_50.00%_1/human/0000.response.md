```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n and m are very large. The valid pairs are not listed here due to their extremely large number.

# Test 7

```
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 1 and m is very large. The only valid pair is (1,1).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n is very large and m is 1. The only valid pair is (1,1).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 2 and m is very large. The valid pairs are (1,1) and (2,1).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```

**Input**: 
```
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are very large. The valid pairs are not listed here due to their extremely large number.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when n is 1 and m is 2. The valid pairs are (1,1) and (1,2).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 2 and m is 1. The valid pairs are (1,1) and (2,1).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when both n and m are very large and differ by 1. The valid pairs are not listed here due to their extremely large number.
