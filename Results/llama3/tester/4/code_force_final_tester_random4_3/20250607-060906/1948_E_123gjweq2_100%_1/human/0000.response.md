# Test 1
**Input**:
```
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With n = 2 and k = 3, the code should assign the integers 2 and 1 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5 4
```
**Output**:
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle a larger graph. With n = 5 and k = 4, the code should assign the integers 3, 1, 5, 2, and 4 to the vertices, resulting in two cliques.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
8 16
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when k is large enough to connect all vertices. With n = 8 and k = 16, the code should assign the integers 1 to 8 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when k is small. With n = 2 and k = 1, the code should assign the integers 1 and 2 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 3 2
1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a small graph with k = 2. With n = 3 and k = 2, the code should assign the integers 1, 3, and 2 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
4 3
```
**Output**:
```
1 4 2 3
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when k is moderate. With n = 4 and k = 3, the code should assign the integers 1, 4, 2, and 3 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when n = 1. With n = 1 and k = 1, the code should assign the integer 1 to the vertex, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
40 40
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 ... 40
1
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when n is large. With n = 40 and k = 40, the code should assign the integers 1 to 40 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when k is moderate. With n = 2 and k = 2, the code should assign the integers 1 and 2 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1 3 2
1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle a small graph with k = 3. With n = 3 and k = 3, the code should assign the integers 1, 3, and 2 to the vertices, resulting in a single clique.
