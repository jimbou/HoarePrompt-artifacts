# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with two rows and one column, where the top row is white and the bottom row is black. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to change the color of any square with an operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 6x6 grid with a mix of white and black squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x1 grid with a single white square. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already the same color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 2x2 grid with all black squares. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already the same color.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 3x4 grid with alternating white and black squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 4x2 grid with two columns of black squares followed by two columns of white squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 4x4 grid with a mix of white and black squares. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x5 grid with alternating white and black squares. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles an empty grid. The expected output is "YES" because an empty grid is considered to be the same color.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
500 500
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a large grid with 500 rows and 500 columns. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 500
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with one row and 500 columns. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
500 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with 500 rows and one column. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing a sequence of operations.
