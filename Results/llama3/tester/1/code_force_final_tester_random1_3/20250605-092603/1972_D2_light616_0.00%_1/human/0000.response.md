# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when both n and m are 1. The expected output is 0 because there are no ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is 2 and m is 3. The expected output is 1 because there is one ordered pair (2, 2) that satisfies the given conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is 3 and m is 5. The expected output is 1 because there is one ordered pair (3, 3) that satisfies the given conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is 10 and m is 8. The expected output is 6 because there are six ordered pairs (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8) that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is 100 and m is 1233. The expected output is 423 because there are 423 ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n is 1000000 and m is 1145141. The expected output is 5933961 because there are 5933961 ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is 1 and m is a large number (1000000). The expected output is 0 because there are no ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is a large number (1000000) and m is 1. The expected output is 0 because there are no ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when both n and m are large numbers (1000000). The expected output is 5933961 because there are 5933961 ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is 2 and m is a large number (2000000). The expected output is 1 because there is one ordered pair (2, 2) that satisfies the given conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when n is a large number (2000000) and m is 2. The expected output is 1 because there is one ordered pair (2, 2) that satisfies the given conditions.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when both n and m are large numbers (2000000). The expected output is 5933961 because there are 5933961 ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.
