# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The phone's charge is 3 units, and it needs to send a message at moment 3. If the phone is not turned off, it will lose 3 units of charge, dropping to 0, and Stepan will not be able to send the message. If the phone is turned off and on, it will lose 5 units of charge, which is also not enough to send the message.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple messages. The phone's charge is 21 units, and it needs to send messages at moments 4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, and 26. The function should be able to calculate the optimal way to turn the phone on and off to conserve charge and send all the messages.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle consecutive messages. The phone's charge is 10 units, and it needs to send messages at moments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The function should be able to calculate the optimal way to turn the phone on and off to conserve charge and send all the messages.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large inputs. The phone's charge is 1 billion units, and it needs to send a message at moment 1 billion. If the phone is not turned off, it will lose 1 billion units of charge, dropping to 0, and Stepan will not be able to send the message. If the phone is turned off and on, it will lose 1 billion units of charge, which is also not enough to send the message.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle edge cases. The phone's charge is 11 units, and it needs to send messages at moments 6, 8, and 10. The function should be able to calculate the optimal way to turn the phone on and off to conserve charge, but in this case, it is not possible to send all the messages.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large inputs and multiple messages. The phone's charge is 621526648 units, and it needs to send messages at moments 51789, 61859, 71998, 73401, 247675, 298086, 606959, 663464, 735972, 806043, 806459, and 919683. The function should be able to calculate the optimal way to turn the phone on and off to conserve charge and send all the messages.
