# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only one element. The expected output is 1, as there are no operations to be performed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the function's behavior for a small input array. The expected output is 4, as demonstrated in the problem description.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for a slightly larger input array. The expected output is 4, as the largest divisor of 5 (which is not 5 itself) is 1, and swapping elements at indices 1 and 5 does not affect the position of 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
120240229
```
**Output**: 
```
67108864
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for a large input array. The expected output is 67108864, which is the result of performing the swap operations as described in the problem.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only two elements. The expected output is 2, as the swap operation will move the element 1 to the second position.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for the maximum possible input value. The expected output is 536870912, which is the result of performing the swap operations as described in the problem.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only one element. The expected output is 1, as there are no operations to be performed.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input value should be a positive integer.
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for an invalid input value (0). The expected output is an error message, as the input value should be a positive integer.

# Test 9 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input value should be a positive integer.
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior for an invalid input value (-1). The expected output is an error message, as the input value should be a positive integer.

# Test 10 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input value should be an integer.
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior for an invalid input value (1.5). The expected output is an error message, as the input value should be an integer.
