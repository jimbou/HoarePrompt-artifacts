# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array has two elements, and the function should return 2 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has duplicate elements. The function should return 2 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has elements that are close to each other. The function should return 3 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has elements that are far apart. The function should return 2 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has elements that are very far apart. The function should return 1 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only two elements. The function should return 1 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has large elements. The function should return 2 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only one element. The function should return 1 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array is empty. The function should return 0 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has negative elements. The function should return 1 as the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.
