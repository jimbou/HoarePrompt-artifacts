# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to change the color of any square with an operation when there are two rows and one column, and the colors are different.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color after two operations, as shown in the diagram.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that a single square is already the same color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that all squares are already the same color.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color in two operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
500 500
<500x500 grid with alternating BW>
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks the function's performance with a large grid size.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 500
<1x500 grid with alternating BW>
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case verifies the function's behavior with a large number of columns.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
500 1
<500x1 grid with alternating BW>
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks the function's behavior with a large number of rows.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case verifies the function's behavior with an empty grid.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
This test case checks the function's behavior with invalid input (negative grid size).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
Invalid character
```
**Output**: 
```
Error or Exception
```
This test case verifies the function's behavior with invalid input (non-'W' or 'B' character).
