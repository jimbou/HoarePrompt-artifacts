Here are the comprehensive test cases for the problem:

**Basic Test Cases**

# Test 1: Single character string
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: A single character string is already sorted, so only 1 piece is needed.

# Test 2: Already sorted string
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is already sorted, so only 1 piece is needed.

# Test 3: Simple unsorted string
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string needs to be cut into 2 pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.

# Test 4: String with multiple cuts needed
**Input**: 
```
1
11010
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The string needs to be cut into 3 pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.

**Edge Test Cases**

# Test 5: Empty string
**Input**: 
```
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: An empty string is considered sorted, so only 1 piece is needed.

# Test 6: String with only 0s
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: A string with only 0s is already sorted, so only 1 piece is needed.

# Test 7: String with only 1s
**Input**: 
```
1
11111111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: A string with only 1s is already sorted, so only 1 piece is needed.

# Test 8: String with alternating 0s and 1s
**Input**: 
```
1
01010101
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string needs to be cut into 2 pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.

# Test 9: String with multiple consecutive 0s and 1s
**Input**: 
```
1
000111000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The string needs to be cut into 3 pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.

# Test 10: Long string with multiple cuts needed
**Input**: 
```
1
110100110100110100
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The string needs to be cut into 6 pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.

These test cases cover various scenarios, including basic cases, edge cases, and longer strings that require multiple cuts.
