YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The first and third disks can be decreased by 0.5, and the second disk can be increased by 0.5, resulting in a decrease in the sum of all radii.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where it is not possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. There is no way to decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining the tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one disk. Since there are no other disks to compare with, it is not possible to change the radii in the desired manner.

# Test 4

```
2
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two disks that are tangent to each other. Since the sum of their radii cannot be decreased, it is not possible to change the radii in the desired manner.
