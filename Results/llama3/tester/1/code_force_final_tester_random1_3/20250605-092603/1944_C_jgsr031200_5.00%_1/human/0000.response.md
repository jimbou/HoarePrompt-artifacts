# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the game. The first test case has two 0s and two 1s, the second test case has a sequence of numbers from 0 to 3, and the third test case has two 1s. The expected output is the MEX of the array c after the game ends.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has only one element, which is 0. The expected output is 1, because the MEX of an array with only one element is always the next integer.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has two elements, both of which are 0. The expected output is 1, because the MEX of an array with two 0s is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a sequence of numbers from 0 to 2. The expected output is 0, because the MEX of an array with a sequence of numbers is always 0.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a mix of numbers, including duplicates. The expected output is 3, because the MEX of an array with a mix of numbers is the next integer after the largest number in the array.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
200000
0 0 0 ... 0 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a large number of elements, all of which are 0. The expected output is 1, because the MEX of an array with a large number of 0s is always 1.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
200000
0 1 2 ... 199999 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a large number of elements, all of which are a sequence of numbers from 0 to 199999. The expected output is 200000, because the MEX of an array with a large sequence of numbers is always the next integer after the largest number in the array.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
200000
199999 199999 ... 199999 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the scenario where the input array has a large number of elements, all of which are the same large number. The expected output is 200000, because the MEX of an array with a large number of the same large number is always the next integer after the largest number in the array.
