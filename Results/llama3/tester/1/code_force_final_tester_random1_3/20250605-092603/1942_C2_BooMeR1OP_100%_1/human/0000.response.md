# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It verifies that the function can correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is less than the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is equal to the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is equal to the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle large inputs.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 200000 1000000
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle cases where the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is equal to the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs, such as duplicate vertices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs, such as vertices with values less than 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle invalid inputs, such as vertices with values greater than the number of sides of the polygon.
