# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is one occurrence of each number (1, 2, 3) and no occurrence of 4. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is one occurrence of 1, no occurrence of 2, one occurrence of 3, and two occurrences of 4. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of 1, 3, and two 4's is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3) and no occurrence of 4. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of two 1's, two 2's, and two 3's is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are three occurrences of 1 and 2, two occurrences of 3, and no occurrence of 4. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of three 1's, three 2's, and two 3's is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**:
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no occurrences of 1, and nine occurrences of each of 2, 3, and 4. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of nine 2's, nine 3's, and nine 4's is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no occurrences of any number. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of no numbers is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**:
```
200
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are 200 occurrences of each number. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of 200 1's, 200 2's, 200 3's, and 200 4's is 0, so Bob wins.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is one occurrence of each number. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero. In this case, the XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 0, so Bob wins.
