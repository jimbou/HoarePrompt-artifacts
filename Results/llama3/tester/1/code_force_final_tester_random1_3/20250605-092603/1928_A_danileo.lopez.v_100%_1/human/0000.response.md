# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a square (1x1), and it should return "No" because it cannot be cut into two rectangles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x1 rectangle, and it should return "No" because it can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x6 rectangle, and it should return "Yes" because it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 3x2 rectangle, and it should return "Yes" because it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x2 rectangle, and it should return "Yes" because it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 2x4 rectangle, and it should return "Yes" because it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a 6x3 rectangle, and it should return "No" because it can only be cut into two 6x1 or 3x2 rectangles, which are considered the same.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle has a very large width (1x1000000000), and it should return "No" because it can only be cut into two 1x500000000 rectangles, which are considered the same.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle has a very large height (1000000000x1), and it should return "No" because it can only be cut into two 500000000x1 rectangles, which are considered the same.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
This test case checks the scenario where the input rectangle is a very large square (1000000000x1000000000), and it should return "Yes" because it can be cut into two 500000000x1000000000 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 1000000000x500000000 rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.
