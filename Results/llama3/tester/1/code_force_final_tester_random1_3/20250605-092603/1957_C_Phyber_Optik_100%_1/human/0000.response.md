# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**: 
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle larger chessboards and more moves.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**: 
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a large chessboard and multiple moves.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the chessboard size is 1 and no moves have been played.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle a 2x2 chessboard with one move played.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's performance with a moderate-sized chessboard and multiple moves.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3628800
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle a larger chessboard with no moves played.
