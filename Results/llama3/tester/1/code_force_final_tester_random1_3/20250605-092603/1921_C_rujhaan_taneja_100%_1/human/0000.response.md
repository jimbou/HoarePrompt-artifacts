# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3 1 5
3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With an initial charge of 3, a consumption rate of 1 per unit of time, and a consumption of 5 when turning off and on, the phone's charge will drop to 0 when trying to send a message at moment 3, making it impossible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the code can handle a sequence of messages with varying time intervals. The phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a sequence of consecutive messages. The phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when dealing with extremely large numbers. The phone's charge is insufficient to send the message at moment 1000000000.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle a sequence of messages with varying time intervals and a high consumption rate. The phone's charge is insufficient to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when dealing with a large number of messages and a high consumption rate. The phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the phone's initial charge is equal to the consumption rate. The phone's charge will drop to 0 when trying to send the message at moment 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when the phone's initial charge is 0. The phone is unable to send any messages.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
-1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the phone's initial charge is negative. The phone is unable to send any messages.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when the phone's initial charge is extremely large. The phone's charge is still insufficient to send the message at moment 1000000000.
