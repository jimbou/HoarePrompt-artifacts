**Description**: Test case with a single message at moment 3. The phone's charge is 3 units, and it loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. If Stepan doesn't turn off the phone, it will lose 3 units of charge by the time it sends the message, dropping the charge to 0. If Stepan turns off and on the phone, it will lose 5 units of charge, which is also not enough to send the message.
