2 3 4 5 6 5
1 3 8 10 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

**Input**:
```
1
2 5 4
1 4
7 3 4 4 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
6 4 4
1 5 2
3 2 2 1 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0 5 6
1 3 4 10 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where one of the arrays is empty. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
6 0 6
2 3 8 5 6 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where one of the arrays is empty. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 0
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where k is 0. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 1
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where k is 1. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 7
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where k is odd. It verifies that the function can correctly identify when it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to k is included.
