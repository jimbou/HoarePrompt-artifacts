# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 2
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It should return 4 because all subsegments of array a are good.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when k is increased. It should return 3 because only subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 4 4
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when k is equal to m. It should return 2 because only subsegments starting at positions 1 and 2 are good.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
11 5 3
9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3
6 9 7 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a larger input size. It should return 4 because subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are good.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
4 1 5 6
6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when m is equal to 1. It should return 1 because only the subsegment starting at position 1 is good.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the smallest possible input size. It should return 1 because the only subsegment is good.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000 1
[1] * 200000
[1] * 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the largest possible input size. It should return 200000 because all subsegments are good.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1 1
[1] * 200000
[1]
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when m is equal to 1 and k is equal to 1. It should return 200000 because all subsegments are good.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000 200000
[1] * 200000
[1] * 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when k is equal to m and m is equal to n. It should return 1 because only the subsegment starting at position 1 is good.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1 200000
[1] * 200000
[1]
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when k is greater than m. It should return 0 because no subsegments are good.
