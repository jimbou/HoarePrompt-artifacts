# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
No
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It checks if the function can correctly determine whether it's possible to obtain a tower with m cubes after n moves.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n and m are both 1. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 1 move.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 2 and m is 1. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 2 moves (put 1 cube, then remove 1 cube).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 1 and m is 2. The function should return "No" because it's not possible to obtain a tower with 2 cubes after 1 move.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n and m are both 100. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 100 cubes after 100 moves.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 100 and m is 1. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 100 moves (put 1 cube, then remove 99 cubes).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 1 and m is 100. The function should return "No" because it's not possible to obtain a tower with 100 cubes after 1 move.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n and m are both 0. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 0 cubes after 0 moves.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 0 and m is 1. The function should return "No" because it's not possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 0 moves.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 1 and m is 0. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 0 cubes after 1 move (remove 1 cube).
