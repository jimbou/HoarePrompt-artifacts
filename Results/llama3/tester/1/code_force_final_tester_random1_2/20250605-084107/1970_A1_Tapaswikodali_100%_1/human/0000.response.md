# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
(())
```
**Output**: 
```
(())
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple balanced parentheses sequence with two pairs of parentheses. The expected output is the same as the input since the sequence is already balanced.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
(()(()))
```
**Output**: 
```
()(()())
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a more complex balanced parentheses sequence with multiple pairs of parentheses. The expected output is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
((()))
```
**Output**: 
```
((()))
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a balanced parentheses sequence with multiple opening parentheses followed by multiple closing parentheses. The expected output is the same as the input since the sequence is already balanced.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
())
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input is not a balanced parentheses sequence
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an unbalanced parentheses sequence with more closing parentheses than opening parentheses. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is not a balanced parentheses sequence.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
(()
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input is not a balanced parentheses sequence
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an unbalanced parentheses sequence with more opening parentheses than closing parentheses. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is not a balanced parentheses sequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
()
```
**Output**: 
```
()
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple balanced parentheses sequence with a single pair of parentheses. The expected output is the same as the input since the sequence is already balanced.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
(((((((((((())))))))))))
```
**Output**: 
```
(((((((((((())))))))))))
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a large balanced parentheses sequence with many pairs of parentheses. The expected output is the same as the input since the sequence is already balanced.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
)(()
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input is not a balanced parentheses sequence
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an unbalanced parentheses sequence with a closing parenthesis followed by an opening parenthesis. The expected output is an error message indicating that the input is not a balanced parentheses sequence.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
(()())(())
```
**Output**: 
```
()(()())(())
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a balanced parentheses sequence with multiple pairs of parentheses separated by another pair of parentheses. The expected output is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
((((()))))
```
**Output**: 
```
((((()))))
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a balanced parentheses sequence with multiple pairs of parentheses nested inside each other. The expected output is the same as the input since the sequence is already balanced.
