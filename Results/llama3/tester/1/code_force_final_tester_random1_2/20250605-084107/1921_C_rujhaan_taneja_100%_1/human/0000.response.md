# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the phone's charge is not enough to send all messages.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function works correctly when the phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the phone's charge consumption per unit of time is 1 and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially is 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the phone's charge is very large, but the charge consumption per unit of time and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially are also very large.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the phone's charge is not enough to send all messages, and the charge consumption per unit of time is greater than the consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
