# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
5
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4) and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
?
```
**Description**: This test case pushes the function to its limits by using the maximum allowed values for the number of sides of the polygon and the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4) and Bessie has chosen two adjacent vertices.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1 999999999
1
```
**Output**: 
```
?
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when Bessie has chosen only one vertex and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is very large.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is odd and Bessie has chosen three consecutive vertices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even and Bessie has chosen four vertices that are evenly spaced.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum allowed (4) and Bessie has chosen two vertices that are opposite each other.
