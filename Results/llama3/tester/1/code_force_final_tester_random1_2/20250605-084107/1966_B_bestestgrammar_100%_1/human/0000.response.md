# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to change the color of any square with an operation when there are two rows and one column, and the colors are different.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function can handle a larger grid and correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color after a sequence of operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with only one cell and one color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that all squares are already the same color when the grid has two rows and two columns, and all cells are the same color.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with alternating colors and identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies that it's possible to make all squares the same color when the grid has four rows and two columns, and the colors are alternating.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color when the grid has four rows and four columns, and the colors are arranged in a specific pattern.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case verifies that the function correctly handles a grid with one row and five columns, and identifies that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
