# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. The input array has 5 elements, and the function should return 5, indicating that all elements can be made equal by adding a permutation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function handles arrays with duplicate elements correctly. The input array has 3 identical elements, and the function should return 3.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with large numbers. The input array has two elements with a large difference, and the function should return 1, indicating that only one element can be made equal by adding a permutation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 3 7
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple elements that can be made equal. The input array has two elements that can be made equal (3 and 7), and the function should return 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with larger arrays. The input array has 6 elements, and the function should return 6, indicating that all elements can be made equal by adding a permutation.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function handles arrays with a single element correctly. The input array has only one element, and the function should return 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an empty array. The input array has no elements, and the function should return 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input array should have non-negative integers.
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's error handling for invalid input. The input array has a negative integer, which is not allowed, and the function should return an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input array should have integers.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's error handling for invalid input. The input array has a non-integer value, which is not allowed, and the function should return an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Input array should have integers.
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's error handling for invalid input. The input array has a non-integer value, which is not allowed, and the function should return an error message.
