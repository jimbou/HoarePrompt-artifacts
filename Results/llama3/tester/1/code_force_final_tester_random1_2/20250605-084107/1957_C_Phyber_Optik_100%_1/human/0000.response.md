# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With a 4x4 chessboard and one move already played (1, 2), there are three possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**: 
```
331
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's performance with a larger chessboard (8x8) and one move already played (7, 6).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**: 
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the code's scalability with a large chessboard (1000x1000) and four moves already played.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the chessboard size is 1x1 and no moves have been played.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when all possible moves have been played on a 3x3 chessboard.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the chessboard size is 2x2 and one move has been played.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the code's performance with a 5x5 chessboard and two moves already played.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3628800
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's scalability with a 10x10 chessboard and no moves played.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
16
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's behavior with a 7x7 chessboard and three moves already played.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
40320
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the code's performance with a 9x9 chessboard and one move already played.
