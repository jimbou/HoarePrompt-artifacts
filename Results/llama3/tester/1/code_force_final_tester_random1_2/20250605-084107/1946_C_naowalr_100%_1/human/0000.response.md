5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The tree has 5 vertices and 4 edges. Removing 1 edge should result in 2 connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 2 vertices and 1 edge. Removing 1 edge should result in 2 connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a long chain of vertices. Removing 1 edge should result in 2 connected components with at least 3 vertices each.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 3 vertices and 2 edges. Removing 1 edge should result in 2 connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a large number of vertices and edges. Removing 2 edges should result in 3 connected components with at least 1 vertex each.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the tree has a complex structure. Removing 2 edges should result in 3 connected components with at least 2 vertices each.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has only 1 vertex and 0 edges. Removing 0 edges should result in 1 connected component with 1 vertex.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the tree has 0 vertices and 0 edges. Removing 0 edges should result in 0 connected components.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of edges to be removed is equal to the number of edges in the tree. Removing all edges should result in 5 connected components with 1 vertex each.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 0
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of edges to be removed is 0. Removing 0 edges should result in 1 connected component with 5 vertices.
