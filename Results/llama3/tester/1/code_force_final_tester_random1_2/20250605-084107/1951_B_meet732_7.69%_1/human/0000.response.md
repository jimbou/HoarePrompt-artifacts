2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cows is 2 and the cow's index is 1. The expected output is 0 because the cow will lose the match.

1
100000 100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of cows is large (100000) and the cow's index is 100000. The expected output is 0 because the cow will not participate in any matches.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
