# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. The phone's charge is 3 units, and it loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. The first message needs to be sent at moment 3, which would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 units of charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send all messages.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle multiple messages. The phone's charge is 21 units, and it loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. The messages need to be sent at moments 4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, and 26. By turning off and on the phone at appropriate moments, it is possible to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle consecutive messages. The phone's charge is 10 units, and it loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time. The messages need to be sent at consecutive moments from 1 to 5. By turning off and on the phone at appropriate moments, it is possible to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large inputs. The phone's charge is 1 billion units, and it loses 1 billion units of charge per unit of time. The message needs to be sent at moment 1 billion, which would consume 1 billion units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 units of charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large inputs and multiple messages. The phone's charge is 11 units, and it loses 9 units of charge per unit of time. The messages need to be sent at moments 6, 8, and 10. By turning off and on the phone at appropriate moments, it is not possible to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's ability to handle large inputs and multiple messages. The phone's charge is 621526648 units, and it loses 2585904 units of charge per unit of time. The messages need to be sent at the given moments. By turning off and on the phone at appropriate moments, it is possible to send all messages without running out of charge.
