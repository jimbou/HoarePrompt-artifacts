# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are 1. Since there are no pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions, the output should be 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 2 and m is 3. The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2), so the output should be 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 3 and m is 5. The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (3, 3), so the output should be 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 10 and m is 8. The pairs that satisfy the conditions are (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), and (8, 8), so the output should be 6.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
423
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 100 and m is 1233. The output should be 423, which is the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 1000000 and m is 1145141. The output should be 5933961, which is the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 1 and m is 1000000. Since there are no pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions, the output should be 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 1000000 and m is 1. Since there are no pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions, the output should be 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are 1000000. The output should be 5933961, which is the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 2 and m is 2000000. The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2), so the output should be 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 2000000 and m is 2. The only pair that satisfies the conditions is (2, 2), so the output should be 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5933961
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are 2000000. The output should be 5933961, which is the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
