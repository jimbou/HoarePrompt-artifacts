# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
5
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum possible value (4), and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is the maximum possible value (10^9), and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5). The maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is an odd number (7), and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices (3).

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is an even number (8), and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (4).

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is a small odd number (5), and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 3
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**:
```
8
```
**Description**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is a larger even number (10), and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices (5).

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
9 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is a larger odd number (9), and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices (4).
