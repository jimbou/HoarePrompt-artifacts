# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when there is only one node in the tree. The expected output is 1 operation, which colors the only node black.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when there are two nodes in the tree. The expected output is 2 operations, each coloring one node black.

**Output**: 
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when there are four nodes in the tree, with one node connected to the other three. The expected output is 2 operations, each coloring two nodes black.

7 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when there are seven nodes in the tree, with a more complex connection structure. The expected output is 3 operations, each coloring multiple nodes black.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when there is only one node in the tree, which is already colored black. The expected output is 1 operation, which does not change the color of the node.

```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when there are seven nodes in the tree, with a more complex connection structure and some nodes already colored black. The expected output is 3 operations, each coloring multiple nodes black.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when there is only one node in the tree, which is not colored black. The expected output is 1 operation, which colors the node black.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when there are two nodes in the tree, with neither node colored black. The expected output is 2 operations, each coloring one node black.
