# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3 1 5
3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. With an initial charge of 3, a consumption rate of 1 per unit of time, and a consumption of 5 when turned off and on, the phone cannot send a message at moment 3 without running out of charge.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the code can handle a scenario where the phone has enough charge to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that the code can handle a scenario where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times to conserve charge.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when dealing with extremely large numbers, ensuring that it can handle overflow scenarios.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that the code can handle a scenario where the phone's consumption rate is high, and the messages are sent at close intervals.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
12 621526648 2585904 3566299
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the code can handle a large number of messages and a complex sequence of turning the phone on and off to conserve charge.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that the code can handle a scenario where the phone's initial charge is 1, and it needs to send a message at moment 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's behavior when dealing with extremely large numbers and a simple message sending scenario.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that the code can handle a scenario where multiple messages are sent at the same moment.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the code can handle a scenario where the phone's initial charge is 1, and it needs to send multiple messages at the same moment.
