# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function with a small input. The polygon has 8 sides, Bessie has chosen 4 vertices, and we can choose up to 2 more vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a slightly larger input. The polygon has 7 sides, Bessie has chosen 3 vertices, and we can choose up to 1 more vertex.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a small input where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is equal to the number of sides of the polygon minus 2.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a larger input where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is half of the number of sides of the polygon.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a large input where the number of vertices Bessie has chosen is 200000 and we cannot choose any more vertices.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a small input where we cannot choose any more vertices.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 4
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with an input where the number of vertices we can choose is larger than the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with an input where the number of vertices we can choose is larger than the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000 200000 1000000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with a large input where the number of vertices we can choose is equal to the number of sides of the polygon minus the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 -1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with an invalid input where the number of vertices we can choose is negative.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with an invalid input where the vertices Bessie has chosen are not distinct.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function with an invalid input where the vertices Bessie has chosen are not within the range of the number of sides of the polygon.
