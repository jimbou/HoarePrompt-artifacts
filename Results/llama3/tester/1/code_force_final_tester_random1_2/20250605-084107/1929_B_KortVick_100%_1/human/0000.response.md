**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function with a variety of inputs.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input grid size is the minimum possible (2x2) and the number of diagonals to color is also the minimum possible (3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999999
```
**Output**: 
```
99999999
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with a very large grid size (100,000,000x100,000,000) and a number of diagonals to color that is close to the maximum possible (399,999,999).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the number of diagonals to color is greater than the number of cells in the grid.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with a moderate grid size (4x4) and a number of diagonals to color that is less than the maximum possible (7).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the grid size is odd (7x7) and the number of diagonals to color is less than the maximum possible (11).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's performance with the minimum possible grid size (2x2) and the maximum possible number of diagonals to color (4).
