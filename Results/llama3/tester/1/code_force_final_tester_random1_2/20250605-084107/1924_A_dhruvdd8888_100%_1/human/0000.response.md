# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb". The second line of the output is the string "aa" which is not a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', and 'c') occur as a subsequence of the string "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab". The second line of the output is the string "ccc" which is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string "a" is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
a
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of an empty string. The expected output is "NO" because there is no string to check. The second line of the output is the string "a" which is not a subsequence of an empty string.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets repeated twice. The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings are subsequences of the given string.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 25
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
NO
zz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets. The expected output is "NO" because the string "zz" is not a subsequence of the given string. The second line of the output is the string "zz" which is not a subsequence of the given string.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 1 10
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of a string containing the first 10 alphabets. The expected output is "YES" because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 0 10
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
NO
a
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using no lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing the first 10 alphabets. The expected output is "NO" because there are no alphabets to form a string. The second line of the output is the string "a" which is not a subsequence of the given string.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
-1 1 10
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function handles invalid input (negative length). The expected output is "Invalid input" because the length of the string cannot be negative.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1 -1 10
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function handles invalid input (negative number of alphabets). The expected output is "Invalid input" because the number of alphabets cannot be negative.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 -1
abcdefghij
```
**Output**:
```
Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function handles invalid input (negative length of the string). The expected output is "Invalid input" because the length of the string cannot be negative.
