# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abba". The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**:
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ('a' and 'b') occur as a subsequence of the string "abb". The expected output is "NO" because the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb". The second line of the output is "aa", which is a string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "abb".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', and 'c') occur as a subsequence of the string "aabbccabab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab". The second line of the output is "ccc", which is a string of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the string "a". The expected output is "YES" because the only possible string ("a") is a subsequence of "a".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1 2
ab
```
**Output**:
```
NO
b
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ('a') occur as a subsequence of the string "ab". The expected output is "NO" because the string "b" is not a subsequence of "ab" when considering only the alphabet 'a'. The second line of the output is "b", which is a string of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet and does not occur as a subsequence of "ab".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets repeated. The expected output is "YES" because all possible strings are subsequences of the given string.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 25
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
NO
zz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets but missing the last character to repeat. The expected output is "NO" because the string "zz" is not a subsequence of the given string. The second line of the output is "zz", which is a string of length 2 that can be formed using the last alphabet and does not occur as a subsequence of the given string.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
0 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 0 that can be formed using all 26 lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets. The expected output is "YES" because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
26 0 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if all possible strings of length 26 that can be formed using no lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a string containing all 26 alphabets. The expected output is "YES" because there are no possible strings to form with 0 alphabets, making the condition trivially true.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
-1 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of invalid input where the length of the string to form is negative. The expected output is an error message indicating invalid input.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
26 -1 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of invalid input where the number of alphabets to use is negative. The expected output is an error message indicating invalid input.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 -1
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of invalid input where the length of the string is negative. The expected output is an error message indicating invalid input.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Missing input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of missing input where the string is not provided. The expected output is an error message indicating missing input.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Extra input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of extra input where more than one string is provided. The expected output is an error message indicating extra input.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
extra
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Extra input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the handling of extra input where additional data is provided after the string. The expected output is an error message indicating extra input.
