1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has a mix of increasing and decreasing elements. The expected output is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only two elements that are equal. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only two elements that are in decreasing order. The expected output is 1, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only three elements that are equal. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has three elements that are in increasing order. The expected output is 2, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has four elements that are in increasing order. The expected output is 3, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has five elements that are in increasing order. The expected output is 4, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1 2 3 ... 100
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements that are in increasing order. The expected output is 99, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100
100 99 98 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements that are in decreasing order. The expected output is 99, as rearranging the elements can increase the beauty of the array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements that are equal. The expected output is 0, as there is no way to rearrange the elements to increase the beauty of the array.
