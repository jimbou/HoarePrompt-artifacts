# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2

0
```
This test case covers the basic functionality of the game. The first test case has two 0s and two 1s, and the optimal strategy for Alice is to choose 1 first, resulting in a MEX of 2. The second test case has a sequence of numbers from 0 to 3, and the optimal strategy for Alice is to choose 0 first, resulting in a MEX of 1. The third test case has two 1s, and the optimal strategy for Alice is to choose 1 first, resulting in a MEX of 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has only one element, which is 0. In this case, Alice will choose 0, and the MEX will be 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has two elements, both of which are 0. In this case, Alice will choose 0, and the MEX will be 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has three elements, two of which are 1. In this case, Alice will choose 1 first, and then Bob will choose 1, resulting in a MEX of 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 1 2 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has a large number of elements, specifically 200000. In this case, Alice will choose 0, and the MEX will be 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
199999 199998 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has a large number of elements, specifically 200000, and the elements are in reverse order. In this case, Alice will choose 0, and the MEX will be 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has a large number of elements, specifically 200000, and all elements are 0. In this case, Alice will choose 0, and the MEX will be 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers the edge case where the input array has a large number of elements, specifically 200000, and all elements are 1. In this case, Alice will not be able to choose 0, and the MEX will be 0.
