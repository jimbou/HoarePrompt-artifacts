# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The string "abba" contains all possible subsequences of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets. The function should output "NO" and a string of length 2 that does not occur as a subsequence of the input string.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
ccc
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. The function should output "NO" and a string of length 3 that does not occur as a subsequence of the input string.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the subsequence is 1. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the subsequence is equal to the number of lowercase English alphabets. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 26.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the subsequence is 1 and the number of lowercase English alphabets is 26. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
26 1 1000
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the subsequence is equal to the number of lowercase English alphabets and the number of lowercase English alphabets is 1. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 26.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 26 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the subsequence is 0. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
26 0 1000
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the number of lowercase English alphabets is 0. The function should output "YES" since the input string contains all possible subsequences of length 26.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the length of the input string is 0. The function should output "NO" and a string of length 26 that does not occur as a subsequence of the input string.
