# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the `has_close_elements` function. The input array has 5 elements, and the function should return "YES" because it is possible to make all elements equal to zero using the described operations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when it is not possible to make all elements equal to zero. The input array has 5 elements, and the function should return "NO" because there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains zeros. The input array has 5 elements, and the function should return "YES" because it is possible to make all elements equal to zero using the described operations.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
5 6 0 2 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array contains multiple zeros. The input array has 6 elements, and the function should return "NO" because there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 7 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has a large difference between adjacent elements. The input array has 4 elements, and the function should return "NO" because there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
7 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only 3 elements. The input array has 3 elements, and the function should return "NO" because there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has all elements equal to 1. The input array has 4 elements, and the function should return "NO" because there is no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array already has all elements equal to zero. The input array has 3 elements, and the function should return "YES" because no operations are needed to make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array has only 1 element. The input array has 1 element, and the function should return "YES" because no operations are needed to make all elements equal to zero.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input array is empty. The input array has 0 elements, and the function should return "YES" because no operations are needed to make all elements equal to zero.
