1
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of mushrooms is 1, and the magic power is 1. The permutation is 1. The expected output is 1 1, which means the maximum strength of the elixir is 1, and the minimum number of mushrooms needed is 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
