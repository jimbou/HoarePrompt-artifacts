# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has only one node. The expected output is a single operation that colors the only node black.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has two nodes connected by an edge. The expected output is two operations that color each node black.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has four nodes, with three nodes connected to a central node. The expected output is two operations that color all nodes black.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
7
2 7
3 2
6 4
5 7
1 6
6 7
```
**Output**:
```
3
6 1
7 1
2 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has seven nodes, with a more complex structure. The expected output is three operations that color all nodes black.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
2000
```
**Output**:
```
( expected output with 2000 operations )
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has the maximum number of nodes (2000). The expected output is a sequence of operations that color all nodes black.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has two nodes, but they are connected by a self-loop. The expected output is a single operation that colors both nodes black.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the tree has only one node, and it is connected to itself by a self-loop. The expected output is a single operation that colors the node black.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
( error message or empty output )
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input is invalid (number of nodes is 0). The expected output is an error message or empty output.

# Test 9 (Edge Case)
**Input**:
```
-1
```
**Output**:
```
( error message or empty output )
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input is invalid (number of nodes is negative). The expected output is an error message or empty output.
