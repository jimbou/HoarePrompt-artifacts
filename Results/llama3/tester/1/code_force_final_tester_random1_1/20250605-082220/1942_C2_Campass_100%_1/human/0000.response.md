# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Bessie has chosen 4 vertices and we can choose up to 2 additional vertices. The output should be 6, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Bessie has chosen 3 vertices and we can choose up to 1 additional vertex. The output should be 5, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where Bessie has chosen 2 vertices and we can choose up to 2 additional vertices. The output should be 2, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 4 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where Bessie has chosen 2 vertices and we cannot choose any additional vertices. The output should be 1, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 5 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where Bessie has chosen 5 vertices and we cannot choose any additional vertices. The output should be 10, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where Bessie has chosen 200000 vertices and we cannot choose any additional vertices. The output should be 1000000, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input ( duplicate vertex)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, but one of the vertices is duplicate. The output should be an error message indicating that the input is invalid.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input (vertex out of range)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, but one of the vertices is out of range (greater than the number of sides of the polygon). The output should be an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
