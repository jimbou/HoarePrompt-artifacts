**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes four different grid sizes (4, 2, 4, and 6) with varying arrow configurations. The expected output is "YES" for the first, second, and fourth test cases, indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n), and "NO" for the third test case, indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a simple scenario where the grid size is 2x2, and all arrows point to the right. The expected output is "YES", indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, 2).

# Test 3

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 2x2, and all arrows point to the left. The expected output is "NO", indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 2).

# Test 4
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 4x2, and the arrows are arranged in a alternating pattern. The expected output is "YES", indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, 4).

# Test 5
**Input**:

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 4x2, and the arrows are arranged in a alternating pattern, but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4). The expected output is "NO".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```

```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 6x2, and the arrows are arranged in a complex pattern. The expected output is "YES", indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, 6).

# Test 7
**Input**:

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 6x2, and the arrows are arranged in a complex pattern, but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 6). The expected output is "NO".

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
200000
>><<...><
><>>><...><
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 200000x2, and the arrows are arranged in a repeating pattern. The expected output is "YES", indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, 200000).

# Test 9

```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the grid size is 200000x2, and the arrows are arranged in a repeating pattern, but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 200000). The expected output is "NO".
