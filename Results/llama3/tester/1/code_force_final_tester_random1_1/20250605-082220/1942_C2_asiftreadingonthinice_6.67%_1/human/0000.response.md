**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen are all within the given constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is at its minimum (4) and Bessie has chosen only 2 vertices.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 200000 0
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's performance when the number of sides of the polygon is at its maximum (10^9) and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is odd and Bessie has chosen an odd number of vertices.

**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior when the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen is 0.

5 2 3
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Description**: This test case assesses the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is at its minimum (5) and Bessie has chosen only 2 vertices, with the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen being 3.

**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 0
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Description**: This test case examines the function's behavior when the number of sides of the polygon is even and Bessie has chosen an even number of vertices, with the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen being 0.
