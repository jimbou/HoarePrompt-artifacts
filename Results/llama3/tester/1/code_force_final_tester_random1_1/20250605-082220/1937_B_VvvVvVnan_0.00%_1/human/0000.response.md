# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
00
00
```
**Output**: 
```
000
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the lexicographically smallest string is "000" and there are two paths that yield this string.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1101
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
11000
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the lexicographically smallest string is "11000" and there is only one path that yields this string.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
00100111
11101101
```
**Output**: 
```
001001101
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the lexicographically smallest string is "001001101" and there are four paths that yield this string.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
11
```
**Output**: 
```
111
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid contains only ones, and the lexicographically smallest string is "111" with only one path.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
00
11
```
**Output**: 
```
001
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid contains only zeros in the first row and only ones in the second row, and the lexicographically smallest string is "001" with only one path.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
00
```
**Output**: 
```
110
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid contains only ones in the first row and only zeros in the second row, and the lexicographically smallest string is "110" with only one path.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
0
```
**Output**: 
```
00
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid has only one column, and the lexicographically smallest string is "00" with only one path.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid has only one column and contains only ones, and the lexicographically smallest string is "11" with only one path.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**: 
```
 
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input grid is empty, and the lexicographically smallest string is an empty string with only one path.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
2
00
00
2
11
11
```
**Output**: 
```
000
2
111
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are multiple test cases, and the function should handle each test case independently.
