# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when all piles have the same number of stones. Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which will empty all of the piles at once.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are only two piles with different numbers of stones. Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there is a pile of size 1, so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple piles with different numbers of stones. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave at least one pile non-empty.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are only three piles with different numbers of stones. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave at least one pile non-empty.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple piles with different numbers of stones. Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there is a pile of size 1, so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple piles with different numbers of stones. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn, which will leave at least one pile non-empty.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there is only one pile with a very large number of stones. Alice can win by choosing k=1000000000 on her first turn, which will empty the pile at once.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Number of piles cannot be zero.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when the number of piles is zero. The function should return an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Number of piles cannot be negative.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when the number of piles is negative. The function should return an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Number of stones in a pile cannot be negative.
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when the number of stones in a pile is negative. The function should return an error message.

# Test 11
