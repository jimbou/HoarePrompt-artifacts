# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
**Output**:
```
36
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input contains 6 signs with periodicities 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18. The function should return the year in which all 6 signs will occur, which is 36.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all signs have consecutive periodicities. The input contains 5 signs with periodicities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The function should return the year in which all 5 signs will occur, which is 5.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all signs have the same periodicity. The input contains 5 signs with periodicities 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. The function should return the year in which all 5 signs will occur, which is 5.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**:
```
2012
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with large input values. The input contains 6 signs with periodicities 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, and 1006. The function should return the year in which all 6 signs will occur, which is 2012.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with a single sign. The input contains 1 sign with periodicity 1. The function should return the year in which the sign will occur, which is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an empty input. The input contains 0 signs. The function should return 0, indicating that there are no signs to occur.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
-1
-2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with negative input values. The input contains 4 signs with periodicities -2, -3, -4, and -5. The function should return an error message, indicating that the input values are invalid.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with non-integer input values. The input contains 5 signs with periodicities 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5. The function should return an error message, indicating that the input values are invalid.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Input exceeds maximum limit
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with an input that exceeds the maximum limit. The input contains 20 signs with periodicities 1 to 20. The function should return an error message, indicating that the input exceeds the maximum limit.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
3
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior with multiple test cases. The input contains two test cases: the first test case has 3 signs with periodicities 1, 2, and 3, and the second test case has 4 signs with periodicities 4, 5, 6, and 7. The function should return the years in which all signs will occur for each test case, which are 3 and 7, respectively.
