# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Description**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the square's corners are given in a random order. The expected output is the area of the square, which is 9.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the square's corners are given in a random order, with negative coordinates. The expected output is the area of the square, which is 4.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```
**Output**: 
```
784
```
**Description**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the square's corners are given in a random order, with large coordinates. The expected output is the area of the square, which is 784.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the same coordinates (0, 0). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 -1000
-1000 -1000
-1000 -1000
-1000 -1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the minimum allowed coordinates (-1000, -1000). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1000
1000 1000
1000 1000
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the maximum allowed coordinates (1000, 1000). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the same coordinates (1, 1). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the same coordinates (-1, -1). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
0 1
0 1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all corners of the square are at the same coordinates (0, 1). The expected output is 0, as the area of a square with zero length sides is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
