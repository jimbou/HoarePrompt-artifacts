# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function with different inputs. It checks if the function can correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there is only one stick, which is not enough to form a triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are only two sticks, which is not enough to form a triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are three sticks of the same length, which can form a degenerate triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are three sticks of different lengths, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... 1 (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
(300000 choose 3)
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are a large number of sticks of the same length, which can form a large number of non-degenerate triangles.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 3 ... 300000 (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are a large number of sticks of different lengths, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
10000
3
1 1 1
3
1 1 1
...
3
1 1 1 (10000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
...
1 (10000 times)
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where there are a large number of test cases with the same input, which can form a large number of non-degenerate triangles.
