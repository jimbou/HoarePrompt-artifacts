# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input is a small number (2). The expected output is an array of length 1 with a single element 0, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a slightly larger number (5). The expected output is an array of length 3 with elements 0, 1, and 0, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a moderate-sized number (13). The expected output is an array of length 5 with elements 2, 2, 3, 4, and 2, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a larger number (37). The expected output is an array of length 7 with elements -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, and -1, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 1, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 0 increasing subsequences.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
?
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the maximum allowed value (10^18). The expected output is unknown, but it should be an array of length at most 200 with exactly 10^18 increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2^64
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a value larger than the maximum allowed value (2^64). The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 2^64 increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a negative number (-1), which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly -1 increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a non-integer value (1.5), which is not a valid input according to the problem statement. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1.5 increasing subsequences.
