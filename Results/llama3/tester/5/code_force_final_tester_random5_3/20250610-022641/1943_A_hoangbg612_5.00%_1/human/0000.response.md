# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Alice and Bob play the game with different arrays. The first test case has an array with two 0s and two 1s, the second test case has an array with consecutive integers from 0 to 3, and the third test case has an array with two 1s.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has only one element, which is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has two elements, but one of them is not consecutive (i.e., 0 and 2).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has three elements, but one of them is not consecutive (i.e., 0, 1, and 3).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 1 2 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has a large number of elements (200000), and all elements are consecutive integers from 0 to 199999.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has a large number of elements (200000), and all elements are 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
199999 199999 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has a large number of elements (200000), and all elements are the maximum possible value (199999).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array has an invalid element (-1), which is not a non-negative integer.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the array is empty.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of test cases is invalid (-1).
