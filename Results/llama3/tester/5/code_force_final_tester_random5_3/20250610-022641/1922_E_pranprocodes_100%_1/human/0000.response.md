# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
2
5
13
37
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
3
0 1 0
5
2 2 3 4 2
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes four test cases with different values of X, ranging from 2 to 37. The expected output is the length of the array and the array itself, which has exactly X increasing subsequences.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 1. The expected output is an array of length 1 with a single element 0, which has exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 2. The expected output is an array of length 1 with a single element 0, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing only 0).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 3. The expected output is an array of length 2 with elements 0 and 1, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, the subsequence containing only 0, and the subsequence containing only 1).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 4. The expected output is an array of length 3 with elements 0, 1, and 0, which has exactly 4 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, the subsequence containing only 0, the subsequence containing only 1, and the subsequence containing 0 and 1).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 5. The expected output is an array of length 3 with elements 0, 1, and 1, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, the subsequence containing only 0, the subsequence containing only 1, the subsequence containing 0 and 1, and the subsequence containing 1 and 1).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0 1 2 0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 10. The expected output is an array of length 4 with elements 0, 1, 2, and 0, which has exactly 10 increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 100. The expected output is an array of length 7 with elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 0, which has exactly 100 increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is 1000. The expected output is an array of length 10 with elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 0, which has exactly 1000 increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case checks if the function handles the case when X is a large number (1 followed by 18 zeros). The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
