# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
+
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality of the code when the input string consists of a single "+" character. The expected output is 1, as the penalty for a single array with a sum of 1 is 1.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5
-----
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when the input string consists of only "-" characters. The expected output is 5, as the penalty for an array with a sum of -5 is 5.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle alternating "+" and "-" characters. The expected output is 0, as the penalties for the subarrays cancel each other out.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the input string contains a mix of "+" and "-" characters. The expected output is 4, as the penalties for the subarrays result in a total penalty of 4.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
20
+---++++-+++++---++-
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when the input string contains a large number of characters with a mix of "+" and "-" characters. The expected output is 4, as the penalties for the subarrays result in a total penalty of 4.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the input string is empty. The expected output is 0, as there are no characters to process.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
-
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's behavior when the input string consists of a single "-" character. The expected output is 1, as the penalty for a single array with a sum of -1 is 1.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
5000
+---++++-+++++---++-
```
**Output**:
```
?
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the code's performance when the input string contains a large number of characters. The expected output is unknown, as it depends on the implementation of the code.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1000
+---++++-+++++---++-
```
**Output**:
```
?
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the input string contains a large number of characters. The expected output is unknown, as it depends on the implementation of the code.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
10000
+---++++-+++++---++-
```
**Output**:
```
?
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's performance when the input string contains an extremely large number of characters. The expected output is unknown, as it depends on the implementation of the code.
