# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
This test case covers the basic scenario where there are constraints of type 1, 2, and 3. The expected output is 7, which corresponds to the integers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 that satisfy all the constraints.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers the edge scenario where the constraints are contradictory (k ≥ 5 and k ≤ 4). The expected output is 0, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy both constraints.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
This test case covers a more complex scenario with multiple constraints of type 1, 2, and 3. The expected output is 90, which corresponds to the integers that satisfy all the constraints.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers another edge scenario where the constraints are contradictory (k ≥ 9 and k ≤ 2). The expected output is 0, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy both constraints.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case covers a scenario where the constraints are very restrictive, with multiple constraints of type 3. The expected output is 0, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy all the constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
**Output**: 
```
800000000
```
This test case covers a scenario with very large numbers and multiple constraints of type 1, 2, and 3. The expected output is 800000000, which corresponds to the integers that satisfy all the constraints.
