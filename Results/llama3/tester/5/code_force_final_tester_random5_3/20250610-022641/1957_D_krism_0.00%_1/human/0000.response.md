# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
3
6 2 4
1
3
5
7 3 7 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
0
16
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has a mix of small and large numbers. The expected output is the number of tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only one element. The expected output is 0, as there are no tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has two identical elements. The expected output is 0, as there are no tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has three identical elements. The expected output is 0, as there are no tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
large number
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements. The expected output is a large number, as there are many tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
large number
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements in descending order. The expected output is a large number, as there are many tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of identical elements. The expected output is 0, as there are no tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of zeros. The expected output is 0, as there are no tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 0 1 0 1 0 ... 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
large number
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of alternating 1s and 0s. The expected output is a large number, as there are many tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100000
0 1 0 1 0 1 ... 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
large number
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of alternating 0s and 1s. The expected output is a large number, as there are many tuples that satisfy the given conditions.
