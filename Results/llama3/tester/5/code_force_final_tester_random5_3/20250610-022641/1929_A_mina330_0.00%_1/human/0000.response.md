# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the basic functionality of the function. The input array is [2, 1, 3], and the expected output is 2, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
69 69 69
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when all elements in the array are the same. The expected output is 0, as there is no need to rearrange the elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**: 
```
57
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle larger arrays with varying elements. The expected output is 57, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's behavior when there are duplicate elements in the array. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case examines the function's behavior with a small array size. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the array contains only two identical elements. The expected output is 0, as there is no need to rearrange the elements.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
100
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle large arrays with a wide range of values. The expected output is 99, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained.

# Test 8 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's behavior with extremely large numbers. The expected output is 999999999, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained.
