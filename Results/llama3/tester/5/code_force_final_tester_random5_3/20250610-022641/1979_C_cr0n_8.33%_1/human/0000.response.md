# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the number of outcomes is 3 and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of outcomes is 2 and both multipliers are 3. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where all multipliers are the same (5). In this case, it is impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of outcomes is 6 and the multipliers are 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, and 13. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the multipliers are 6, 3, and 2. In this case, it is impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the number of outcomes is 5 and the multipliers are 9, 4, 6, 8, and 3. The expected output is a distribution of coins that ensures a profit in any winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where there is only one outcome. In this case, the expected output is a single coin bet on that outcome.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of outcomes is 50 and all multipliers are 2. In this case, it is impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the number of outcomes is 50 and all multipliers are 20. In this case, it is impossible to distribute coins in a way that ensures a profit in any winning outcome, so the expected output is -1.
