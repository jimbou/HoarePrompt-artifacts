# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
10
.@@*@.**@@
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. It ensures that the function can correctly count the maximum number of coins that can be collected in a path with a mix of empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5
.@@@@
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
This test case verifies that the function can handle a path with only empty cells and cells with coins, without any thorns.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
15
.@@..@***..@@@*
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
This test case checks the function's ability to handle a longer path with a mix of empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
.
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
This test case is an edge case that checks the function's behavior when the path has only one cell, which is empty.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1
@
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
This test case is another edge case that checks the function's behavior when the path has only one cell, which contains a coin.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1
*
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
This test case is an edge case that checks the function's behavior when the path has only one cell, which contains thorns.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2
.*
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the path has only two cells, one of which contains thorns.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2
.@
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the path has only two cells, one of which contains a coin.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
50
.@@*@.**@@.@@*@.**@@.@@*@.**@@.@@*@.**@@
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
This test case checks the function's ability to handle a long path with a mix of empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
50
*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*@.*
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the path is filled with alternating cells of thorns and coins, making it impossible to collect any coins.
