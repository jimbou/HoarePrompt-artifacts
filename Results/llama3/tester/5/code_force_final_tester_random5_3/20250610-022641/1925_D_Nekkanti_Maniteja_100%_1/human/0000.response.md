# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
55
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The teacher goes on 10 excursions, and each time the pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected sum of friendship values is 1+2+3+...+10 = 55.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**:
```
40000020
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two pairs of friends with different initial friendship values. The teacher goes on 4 excursions, and the expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no pairs of friends. The teacher goes on 24 excursions, but since there are no friends, the expected sum of friendship values is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1, and the teacher goes on only 1 excursion. The expected sum of friendship values is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10^5 10^5 2*10^5
```
**Output**:
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions are at their maximum limits. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10^9
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of excursions is at its maximum limit, and there is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10^5 0 2*10^5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are no pairs of friends, and the teacher goes on the maximum number of excursions. The expected sum of friendship values is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 10^9
```
**Output**:
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one pair of friends with a very large initial friendship value, and the teacher goes on only 1 excursion. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10^5 10^5 1
```
**Output**:
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions are at their maximum limits, and the teacher goes on only 1 excursion. The expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10^5
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
(p*q^-1) mod (10^9+7)
```
