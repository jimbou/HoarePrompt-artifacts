# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there is only one stick available, which is not enough to form any polygon.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that two sticks of the same length are not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple sticks of the same length, allowing for the formation of a square.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that multiple polygons can be formed simultaneously using sticks of different lengths.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all sticks have the same length, but there are not enough sticks to form a polygon.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that sticks of different lengths cannot be used to form a polygon.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
8
2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are multiple sticks of the same length, allowing for the formation of multiple polygons.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
12
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that multiple polygons can be formed simultaneously using sticks of different lengths.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
15
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all sticks have the same length, but there are not enough sticks to form a polygon.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
20
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that multiple polygons can be formed simultaneously using sticks of different lengths.

These test cases cover various scenarios, including:

* Basic test cases: Test 1-4
* Edge test cases: Test 5-10

The edge test cases cover scenarios such as:

* All sticks having the same length (Test 5 and 9)
* Sticks of different lengths (Test 6)
* Multiple sticks of the same length (Test 3, 7, and 10)
* Multiple polygons being formed simultaneously (Test 4, 8, and 10)
