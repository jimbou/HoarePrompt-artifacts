**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It includes five test cases with different permutations and target numbers. The first test case has the target number already in the correct position, so no swaps are needed. The second test case requires one swap to move the target number to the correct position. The third test case requires two swaps to move the target number to the correct position. The fourth test case has the target number already in the correct position, but the permutation is not sorted. The fifth test case requires one swap to move the target number to the correct position.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has only one element, and the target number is the same as the only element in the permutation. No swaps are needed in this case.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has only two elements, and the target number is the second element. One swap is needed to move the target number to the correct position.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
2 3
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has three elements, and the target number is the first element. Two swaps are needed to move the target number to the correct position.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
200000 199999 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
199999 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements (200000), and the target number is the last element. One swap is needed to move the target number to the correct position.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
1 2 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 200000
2 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements (200000), and the target number is the first element. Two swaps are needed to move the target number to the correct position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
100000 99999 ... 1 200000 200001 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
99999 200000
100000 200000
```
**Test Case Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the permutation has a large number of elements (200000), and the target number is in the middle of the permutation. Two swaps are needed to move the target number to the correct position.
