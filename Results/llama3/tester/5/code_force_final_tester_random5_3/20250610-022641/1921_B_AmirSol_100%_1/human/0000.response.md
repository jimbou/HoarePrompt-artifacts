# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10010
00001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The initial state of the boxes is "10010" and the desired state is "00001". The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is the same as the desired state. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
000
111
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is all zeros and the desired state is all ones. The function should return 3, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0101
1010
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is different from the desired state, but the number of ones is the same. The function should return 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
100
101
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is different from the desired state, but the number of ones is the same. The function should return 1, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
10011001
11111110
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is different from the desired state, and the number of ones is different. The function should return 4, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of boxes is 0. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is the same as the desired state, and the number of boxes is large. The function should return 0, indicating that no operations are required.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is all ones and the desired state is all zeros, and the number of boxes is large. The function should return the number of boxes, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
000000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the initial state is all zeros and the desired state is all ones, and the number of boxes is large. The function should return the number of boxes, which is the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired state from the initial state.
