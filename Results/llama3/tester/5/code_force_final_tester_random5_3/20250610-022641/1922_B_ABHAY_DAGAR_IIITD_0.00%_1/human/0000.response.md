# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when all sticks have the same length. The expected output is the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7, which is 35.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there are two distinct lengths of sticks. The expected output is the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle, which is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there are three distinct lengths of sticks, but no combination can form a triangle. The expected output is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there is only one stick. The expected output is 0, as it is not possible to form a triangle with only one stick.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
3
1 1 1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there are multiple test cases. The expected output is the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle for each test case.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... (300000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when the input size is large. The expected output is a very large number, which is the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 300000.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when all sticks have length 0. The expected output is 1, as there is only one way to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there are two distinct lengths of sticks, and one of them is 1. The expected output is 1, as there is only one way to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when all sticks have the same length, and the length is not 1. The expected output is 1, as there is only one way to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the functionality when there are three distinct lengths of sticks, and no combination can form a triangle. The expected output is 0.
