Here are the comprehensive test cases for the problem:

**1. Basic Test Cases**

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has 3 elements. The expected output is 2, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**:
```
57
```
**Description**: This test case covers a larger input array with 5 elements. The expected output is 57, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers an input array with duplicate elements. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

**2. Edge Test Cases**

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the minimum possible input array size (2 elements). The expected output is 1, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
100
1 1 1 ... 1 (100 times)
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an input array with all elements being the same. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an input array with two identical elements. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers an input array with a single element. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Description**: This test case covers an invalid input (empty array). The expected output is an error message indicating invalid input.

Note that these test cases cover various scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error cases. They ensure that the function behaves correctly under different conditions.
