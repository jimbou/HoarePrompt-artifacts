BBBWBW
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 6x6 grid with a mix of white and black cells. The expected output is "YES" because it's possible to make all squares white after two operations.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x1 grid with a single white cell. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already all white.

```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 3x4 grid with alternating white and black cells. The expected output is "YES" because it's possible to make all squares white after two operations.

WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 4x4 grid with a mix of white and black cells. The expected output is "NO" because it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x5 grid with alternating white and black cells. The expected output is "NO" because it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
500 500
<500x500 grid with all white cells>
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function correctly handles a large 500x500 grid with all white cells. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already all white.
