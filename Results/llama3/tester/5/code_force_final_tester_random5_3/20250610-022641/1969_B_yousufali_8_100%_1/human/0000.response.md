# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input string "10" is not sorted in non-descending order, and the minimum cost to make it sorted is 2 (by choosing the whole string and performing a cyclic shift).
