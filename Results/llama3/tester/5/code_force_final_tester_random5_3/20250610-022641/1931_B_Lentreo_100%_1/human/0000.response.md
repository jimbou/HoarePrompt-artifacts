# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there is only one container. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, there is only one container).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are two containers. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple containers. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple containers. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple containers. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 6

```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are multiple containers. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there is only one container and it is empty. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, there is only one container and it is already empty).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there are two containers and both are empty. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, both containers are already empty).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there are two containers and one is empty. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there is only one container and it has the maximum possible amount of water. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same (in this case, there is only one container).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2147483647 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there are two containers and one has the maximum possible amount of water. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case when there are two containers and one has the maximum possible amount of water. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
