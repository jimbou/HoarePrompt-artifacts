# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array contains duplicate elements. The expected output is the MEX of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains all non-negative integers up to n-1. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only one element, which is 0. The expected output is 1, as the MEX of the array c is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only one element, which is 1. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains all non-negative integers up to n-1, where n is a large number. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 199999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains all non-negative integers up to n-1, where n is the maximum allowed value. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only zeros. The expected output is 1, as the MEX of the array c is 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only ones. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains all non-negative integers up to n, where n is the maximum allowed value. The expected output is 0, as the MEX of the array c is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... 0 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array contains only zeros and one large number. The expected output is 1, as the MEX of the array c is 1.
