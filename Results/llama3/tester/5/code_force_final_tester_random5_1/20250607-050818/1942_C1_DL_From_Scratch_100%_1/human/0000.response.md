1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is the minimum possible value (4), and Bessie has chosen the minimum number of vertices (2).

```
**Output**: 
```
999999990
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is the maximum possible value (10^9), and Bessie has chosen the maximum number of vertices (2 \* 10^5).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 0
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen two vertices that are not adjacent.

**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 0
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 8, and Bessie has chosen four vertices that are evenly spaced.

1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is the maximum possible value (10^9), and Bessie has chosen only one vertex.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 4, and Bessie has chosen all 4 vertices.

8 2 0
1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of sides of the polygon is 8, and Bessie has chosen two vertices that are diametrically opposite.
