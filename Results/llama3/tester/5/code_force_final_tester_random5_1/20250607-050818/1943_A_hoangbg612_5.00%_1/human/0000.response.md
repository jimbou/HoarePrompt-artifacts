# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, and Bob chooses the element 1. The final array c is [1, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, Alice and Bob play optimally, but the array a contains consecutive integers from 0 to 3. Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 2, and Bob chooses the element 3. The final array c is [0, 2], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array a contains only one element, which is 1. Alice chooses the element 1, and Bob has no choice but to choose the same element 1. The final array c is [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the array a contains only one element, which is 0. Alice chooses the element 0, and the game ends. The final array c is [0], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array a contains multiple occurrences of the same element. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the array a contains consecutive integers from 0 to 5. Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 2, Bob chooses the element 3, Alice chooses the element 4, and Bob chooses the element 5. The final array c is [0, 2, 4], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array a contains multiple occurrences of the same element. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the array a contains consecutive integers from 0 to 7. Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 2, Bob chooses the element 3, Alice chooses the element 4, Bob chooses the element 5, Alice chooses the element 6, and Bob chooses the element 7. The final array c is [0, 2, 4, 6], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the array a contains multiple occurrences of the same element. Alice chooses the element 1, Bob chooses the element 0, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, and Alice chooses the element 0. The final array c is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the array a contains consecutive integers from 0 to 9. Alice chooses the element 0, Bob chooses the element 1, Alice chooses the element 2, Bob chooses the element 3, Alice chooses the element 4, Bob chooses the element 5, Alice chooses the element 6, Bob chooses the element 7, Alice chooses the element 8, and Bob chooses the element 9. The final array c is [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], which has a MEX of 1.
