```
1
3 1
1 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray has three elements and the sum of the elements is 4. According to the conditions, a subarray with three elements can be good if the sum of the elements is greater than 3.

```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray has three elements and all elements are 1. According to the conditions, a subarray with three elements cannot be good if all elements are 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray is the entire array. According to the conditions, the entire array can be good if the sum of the elements is greater than the number of elements.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray starts from the second element. According to the conditions, a subarray can be good if the sum of the elements is greater than the number of elements.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray starts from the third element. According to the conditions, a subarray can be good if the sum of the elements is greater than the number of elements.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the edge case where the subarray starts from the fourth element. According to the conditions, a subarray can be good if the sum of the elements is greater than the number of elements.
