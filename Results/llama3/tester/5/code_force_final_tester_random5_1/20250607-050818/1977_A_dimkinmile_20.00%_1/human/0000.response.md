# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
No
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem. It checks if the function can correctly determine whether it's possible to obtain a tower with m cubes after n moves.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m). The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 1 move.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves (n) is greater than the number of cubes (m). The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 2 moves (put 1 cube, then remove 1 cube).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Description**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves (n) is less than the number of cubes (m). The function should return "No" because it's not possible to obtain a tower with 2 cubes after 1 move.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge scenario where both the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) are 0. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 0 cubes after 0 moves.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge scenario where both the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) are at their maximum value (100). The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 100 cubes after 100 moves.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the number of moves (n) is at its maximum value (100) and the number of cubes (m) is 1. The function should return "Yes" because it's possible to obtain a tower with 1 cube after 100 moves.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Description**: This test case checks the edge scenario where the number of moves (n) is 1 and the number of cubes (m) is at its maximum value (100). The function should return "No" because it's not possible to obtain a tower with 100 cubes after 1 move.
