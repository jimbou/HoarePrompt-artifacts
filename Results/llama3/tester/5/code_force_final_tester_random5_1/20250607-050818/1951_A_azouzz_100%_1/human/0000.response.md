# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
10101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle a simple case where the desired configuration is achievable by turning on two non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that the function correctly identifies a configuration that cannot be reached, as the two lamps that need to be turned on are adjacent.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when there is only one lamp, which cannot be turned on as the operation requires two non-adjacent lamps.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
11
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's response when there are only two lamps and both need to be turned on, which is not possible as they are adjacent.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
101
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's ability to handle a configuration where two non-adjacent lamps need to be turned on, and it is achievable.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's performance with a large number of lamps (the maximum allowed) and a configuration where no lamps need to be turned on.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with a large number of lamps and a configuration where all lamps need to be turned on, which is not achievable as it requires an even number of lamps to be turned on in pairs.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
5
10101
3
111
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases correctly, including both achievable and unachievable configurations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case assesses the function's response to invalid input (a non-positive number of lamps), which should result in an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
51
111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the function's behavior with an invalid number of lamps (exceeding the maximum allowed), which should result in an error message.
