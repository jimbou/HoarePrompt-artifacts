# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where all sticks have the same length, and any three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two distinct stick lengths, and only certain combinations of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are three distinct stick lengths, and no combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there is only one stick, and it is not possible to form a triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 1 1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are multiple test cases, and the function should return the correct output for each test case.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 ... 1 (300000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
(very large number)
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input size is large, and the function should be able to handle it efficiently.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the stick lengths are zero, and the function should still be able to handle it correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two distinct stick lengths, and only one combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where there are two distinct stick lengths, and only one combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where all sticks have the same length, and only one combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
