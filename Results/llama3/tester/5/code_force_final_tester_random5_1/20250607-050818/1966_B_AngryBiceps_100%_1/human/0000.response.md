# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
W
B
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has only two rows and one column, with the top cell being white and the bottom cell being black. Since there are no two cells of the same color that can be used to perform an operation, the function should return "NO".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has six rows and six columns, with a mix of white and black cells. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has only one row and one column, with the single cell being white. Since there is only one cell, the function should return "YES".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has two rows and two columns, with all cells being black. Since all cells are already the same color, the function should return "YES".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has three rows and four columns, with a mix of white and black cells. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW
WW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has four rows and two columns, with the top two rows being black and the bottom two rows being white. The function should return "YES" because it is possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has four rows and four columns, with a mix of white and black cells. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has only one row and five columns, with a mix of white and black cells. The function should return "NO" because it is not possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
500 500
... (grid with 500 rows and 500 columns, all cells being white)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has 500 rows and 500 columns, with all cells being white. Since all cells are already the same color, the function should return "YES".

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
500 500
... (grid with 500 rows and 500 columns, all cells being black)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has 500 rows and 500 columns, with all cells being black. Since all cells are already the same color, the function should return "YES".

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
500 500
... (grid with 500 rows and 500 columns, with a mix of white and black cells)
```
**Output**: 
```
... (function should return "YES" or "NO" depending on the specific grid)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the grid has 500 rows and 500 columns, with a mix of white and black cells. The function should return "YES" if it is possible to perform operations to make all cells the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

Note: The last three test cases are edge cases that test the function's behavior with large grids. The expected output for these test cases may vary depending on the specific implementation of the function.
