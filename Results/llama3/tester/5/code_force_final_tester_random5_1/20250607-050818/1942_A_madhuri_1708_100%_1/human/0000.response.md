# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the simplest case where n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is an array with two elements, both being 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
69420 69 420
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can generate an array with n = 3 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with three elements, where only one cyclic shift is sorted.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the case where n = 3 and k = 2. Since it's impossible to have two sorted cyclic shifts with n = 3, the expected output is -1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the edge case where n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with a single element, which is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle a larger input where n = 10 and k = 10. The expected output is an array with ten elements, all being 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the case where n = 5 and k = 3. Since it's impossible to have three sorted cyclic shifts with n = 5, the expected output is -1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the case where n = 8 and k = 4. Since it's impossible to have four sorted cyclic shifts with n = 8, the expected output is -1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the edge case where n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with two elements, where only one cyclic shift is sorted.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 2 1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the case where n = 4 and k = 2. The expected output is an array with four elements, where two cyclic shifts are sorted.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can handle the case where n = 6 and k = 3. Since it's impossible to have three sorted cyclic shifts with n = 6, the expected output is -1.
