# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the simplest scenario where the strings have only one character. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "C" that matches strings "a" and "b" but not "c".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
bb
aa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where the strings have the same characters at the same positions. The expected output is "NO" because there is no template that can match strings "aa" and "bb" but not "aa".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle longer strings. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "CODEforces" that matches strings "mathforces" and "luckforces" but not "adhoccoder".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle strings with different characters at the same positions. The expected output is "NO" because there is no template that can match strings "acc" and "abd" but not "abc".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where all strings are the same. The expected output is "NO" because there is no template that can match strings "a" and "a" but not "a".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where the first two strings are different but the third string is the same as the first string. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "B" that matches strings "a" and "b" but not "a".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the maximum length of strings. The expected output is "NO" because there is no template that can match strings "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" and "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" but not "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
b
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where the first two strings are the same but the third string is different. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "B" that matches strings "a" and "a" but not "b".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
b
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where the first two strings are different but the third string is the same as the second string. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "A" that matches strings "a" and "b" but not "b".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function can handle the scenario where the first two strings are the same but the third string is different. The expected output is "YES" because we can create a template "C" that matches strings "a" and "a" but not "c".
