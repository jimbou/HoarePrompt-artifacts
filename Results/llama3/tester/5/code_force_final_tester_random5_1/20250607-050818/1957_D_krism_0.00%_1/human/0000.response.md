# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3
6 2 4
1
3
5
7 3 7 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0
16
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic scenario where the input array has a mix of even and odd numbers, and the function should return the correct count of tuples that satisfy the given condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has only one element, and the function should return 0 as there are no tuples to consider.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has two identical elements, and the function should return 0 as there are no tuples that satisfy the given condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has two distinct elements, and the function should return 1 as there is one tuple that satisfies the given condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has three identical elements, and the function should return 0 as there are no tuples that satisfy the given condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has three distinct elements, and the function should return 2 as there are two tuples that satisfy the given condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
(none)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input array has a large number of elements, and the function should return the correct count of tuples that satisfy the given condition. Note that the output is not provided as it would be too large to display.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
10000
3
6 2 4
1
3
5
7 3 7 2 1
...
```
**Output**: 
```
(none)
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the input has a large number of test cases, and the function should return the correct count of tuples that satisfy the given condition for each test case. Note that the output is not provided as it would be too large to display.
