# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = 3. The expected output is 2, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of 3 sub-problems.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x and n are equal. The input is a single test case with x = 5 and n = 5. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 sub-problems.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
420 69
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is a large number and n is a relatively small number. The input is a single test case with x = 420 and n = 69. The expected output is 6, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 420 into a problemset of 69 sub-problems.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x and n are both 1. The input is a single test case with x = 1 and n = 1. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 1 into a problemset of 1 sub-problem.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 1. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = 1. The expected output is 10, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of 1 sub-problem.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x and n are equal and x is a large number. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = 10. The expected output is 1, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of 10 sub-problems.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is 0. The input is a single test case with x = 0 and n = 1. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 0 into a problemset of 1 sub-problem.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is 0. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = 0. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of 0 sub-problems.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
-10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where x is a negative number. The input is a single test case with x = -10 and n = 3. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty -10 into a problemset of 3 sub-problems.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 -3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where n is a negative number. The input is a single test case with x = 10 and n = -3. The expected output is 0, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved by breaking up the problem of difficulty 10 into a problemset of -3 sub-problems.
