# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when the input is 2. The expected output is an array of length 1 with a single element 0, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a larger input value of 5. The expected output is an array of length 3 with elements 0, 1, and 0, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle an even larger input value of 13. The expected output is an array of length 5 with elements 2, 2, 3, 4, and 2, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle a large input value of 37. The expected output is an array of length 7 with elements -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, and -1, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 1. Since an empty subsequence is also considered an increasing subsequence, the expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is 0. Since an empty subsequence is also considered an increasing subsequence, the expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 0 increasing subsequences.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is the maximum allowed value of 10^18. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 10^18 increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a negative number. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with a negative number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2^64
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a very large number that exceeds the maximum allowed value. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with exactly 2^64 increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1.5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior when the input is a non-integer value. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with a non-integer number of increasing subsequences.
