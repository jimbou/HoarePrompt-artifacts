```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code when the input array is already sorted and the target element is present in the array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the target element is not in its correct position and requires one swap to be in the correct position.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle cases where the target element is not in its correct position and requires one swap to be in the correct position.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the target element is already in its correct position.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle cases where the target element is already in its correct position.

```
1
3 2
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the code's functionality when the target element is not in its correct position and requires one swap to be in the correct position.

```
1
4 1
4 2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 4
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the code's ability to handle cases where the target element is not in its correct position and requires two swaps to be in the correct position.
