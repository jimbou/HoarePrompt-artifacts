# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that when there is only one stick, no polygon can be formed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that two sticks of the same length cannot form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case confirms that a square can be formed using four sticks of the same length.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that a pentagon and a square can be formed simultaneously using the given sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that no polygon can be formed when all sticks have different lengths.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case confirms that a polygon can be formed using multiple sticks of the same length.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that an equilateral triangle can be formed using three sticks of the same length.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
8
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks that two squares can be formed simultaneously using the given sticks.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case confirms that no polygon can be formed when all sticks have different lengths.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies that a polygon can be formed using multiple sticks of the same length.

These test cases cover various scenarios, including:

* Basic cases: single stick, two sticks of the same length, and multiple sticks of the same length.
* Edge cases: all sticks have different lengths, and multiple sticks of the same length.
* Polygon formation: square, pentagon, equilateral triangle, and multiple polygons simultaneously.

These test cases ensure that the function handles different input scenarios and produces the expected output.
