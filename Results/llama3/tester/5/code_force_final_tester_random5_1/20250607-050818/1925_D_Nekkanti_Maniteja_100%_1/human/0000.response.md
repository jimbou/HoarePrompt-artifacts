# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Description**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the code. There is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The teacher goes on 10 excursions, and each time the pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected sum of friendship values is 1+2+3+...+10 = 55.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
777777784
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle multiple pairs of friends with different initial friendship values. The teacher goes on 4 excursions, and the expected sum of friendship values is calculated based on the probabilities of choosing each pair.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when there are no pairs of friends. The expected sum of friendship values is 0, as there are no friendships to increase.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the code's functionality when there is only one pair of friends and the teacher goes on only one excursion. The expected sum of friendship values is 1, as the pair is chosen and their friendship value increases by 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10^5 10^5 2*10^5
```
**Output**: 
```
( expected output )
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's performance under extreme conditions, with a large number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. The expected output should be calculated based on the problem description.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10^9
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
( expected output )
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's behavior when the number of excursions is very large. The expected sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the problem description.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^5 0 2*10^5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the code's functionality when there are no pairs of friends and the teacher goes on a large number of excursions. The expected sum of friendship values is 0, as there are no friendships to increase.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 10^9
```
**Output**: 
```
( expected output )
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the code's ability to handle a very large initial friendship value. The expected sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the problem description.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10^5 10^5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
( expected output )
```
**Description**: This test case checks the code's performance under extreme conditions, with a large number of children, pairs of friends, and only one excursion. The expected output should be calculated based on the problem description.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10^5
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
( expected output )
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the code's functionality when the number of excursions is very large and there is only one pair of friends. The expected sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the problem description.
