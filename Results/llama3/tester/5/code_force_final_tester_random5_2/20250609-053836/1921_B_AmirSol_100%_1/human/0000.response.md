10010
00001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when there are more cats in the initial state than in the final state.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case verifies that the function returns 0 when the initial and final states are the same.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
000
111
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when there are no cats in the initial state and all boxes need to be filled in the final state.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0101
1010
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations when the initial and final states have the same number of cats but in different positions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
100
101
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when there is one more cat in the final state than in the initial state.

**Input**: 
```
1
8
10011001
11111110
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```

**Input**: 
```
1
0
 
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the input size is 0.

**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case verifies that the function returns 0 when the initial and final states are both empty.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
This test case checks the function's behavior when the initial and final states are the same and have a large number of cats.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
This test case verifies that the function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations when the initial state has a large number of cats and the final state is empty.
