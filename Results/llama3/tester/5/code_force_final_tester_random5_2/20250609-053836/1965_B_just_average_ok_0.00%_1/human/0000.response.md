# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is a sequence of size 1 with the element 1, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 2 and there is a subsequence with a sum of 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 6 and k = 1. The expected output is a sequence of size 5 with elements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 1 and there is a subsequence with a sum of each number from 2 to 6.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 8 and k = 8. The expected output is a sequence of size 7 with elements 1 repeated 7 times, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 8 and there is a subsequence with a sum of each number from 1 to 7.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 9 and k = 3. The expected output is a sequence of size 4 with elements 7, 1, 4, and 1, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 3 and there is a subsequence with a sum of each number from 1 to 9 except 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 10 and k = 7. The expected output is a sequence of size 4 with elements 1, 2, 8, and 3, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 7 and there is a subsequence with a sum of each number from 1 to 10 except 7.

# Test 6 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1, which is an edge case. The expected output is an empty sequence, as there is no subsequence that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 7 (Edge Case)
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1000000 and k = 1000000, which is an edge case. The expected output is a sequence of size 25 with elements 1 repeated 25 times, which satisfies the conditions that there is no subsequence with a sum of 1000000 and there is a subsequence with a sum of each number from 1 to 999999.
