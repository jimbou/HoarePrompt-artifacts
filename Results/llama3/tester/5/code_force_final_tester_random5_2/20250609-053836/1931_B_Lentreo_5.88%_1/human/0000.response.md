# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there is only one container. Since the amount of water in the container is already equal to the average, the function should return "YES".

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are two containers with different amounts of water. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in both containers equal by pouring water from one container to the other, the function should return "NO".

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since it is possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, the function should return "YES".

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, the function should return "NO".

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since it is possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, the function should return "YES".

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with different amounts of water. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, the function should return "NO".

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there is only one container with zero amount of water. Since the amount of water in the container is already equal to the average, the function should return "YES".

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are two containers with zero amount of water. Since the amounts of water in both containers are already equal, the function should return "YES".

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with zero amount of water. Since the amounts of water in all containers are already equal, the function should return "YES".

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there is only one container with a large amount of water. Since the amount of water in the container is already equal to the average, the function should return "YES".

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
2
2147483647 0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are two containers with a large amount of water in one container and zero amount of water in the other container. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in both containers equal by pouring water from one container to the other, the function should return "NO".

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
5
2147483647 0 0 0 0

**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are multiple containers with a large amount of water in one container and zero amount of water in the other containers. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, the function should return "NO".
