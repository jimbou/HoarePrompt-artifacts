# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a basic scenario where the array has a mix of different elements. The expected output is 4, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where all elements in the array are already equal. The expected output is 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has a majority of equal elements, but with a small section of different elements. The expected output is 2, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has only one element. The expected output is 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has only two elements. The expected output is 1, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has three distinct elements. The expected output is 2, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has a mix of different elements, with some elements appearing multiple times. The expected output is 6, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers a scenario where the array has a mix of different elements, with some elements appearing multiple times. The expected output is 7, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the array has the maximum allowed size (200000) and contains a sequence of distinct elements. The expected output is 199999, which is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the array has the maximum allowed size (200000) and contains only one element. The expected output is 0, indicating no burles are needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
10000
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
...
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0
...
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers an edge scenario where the input contains the maximum allowed number of test cases (10000). The expected output is a sequence of minimum burles needed for each test case.

Note: The above test cases cover a range of scenarios, including basic cases, edge cases, and extreme cases. They ensure that the function is thoroughly tested and can handle various inputs.
