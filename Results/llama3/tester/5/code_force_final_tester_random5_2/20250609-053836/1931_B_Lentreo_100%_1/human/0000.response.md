```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there is only one container with a large amount of water. Since the amount of water in the container is already equal to the average, the function should return "YES".

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```

2
2147483647 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks if the function works correctly when there are two containers with a large amount of water in one container and zero amount of water in the other. Since it is not possible to make the amounts of water in both containers equal by pouring water from one container to the other, the function should return "NO".
