```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a grid with two rows and one column, where the top square is white and the bottom square is black. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to change the color of any square with an operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 6
WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 6x6 grid with a mix of white and black squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares white after two operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x1 grid with a single white square. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already all white.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 2x2 grid with all black squares. The expected output is "YES" because the grid is already all black.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 3x4 grid with alternating white and black squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares white after two operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
BB
BB
WW

```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 4x2 grid with two black squares followed by two white squares. The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to make all squares white after one operation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
WWBW
BBWB
WWBB
BBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 4x4 grid with a mix of white and black squares. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
WBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
This test case checks if the function correctly handles a 1x5 grid with alternating white and black squares. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
