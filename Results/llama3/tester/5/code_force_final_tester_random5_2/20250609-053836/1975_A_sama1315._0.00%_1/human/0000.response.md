# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No

Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function. It includes three test cases with different array lengths and elements. The first test case has an array that cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping, the second test case has an array that can be sorted, and the third test case has an array that is already sorted.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only two elements. The function should return "Yes" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has only one element. The function should return "Yes" because the array is already sorted.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array is in descending order. The function should return "No" because the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. The function should return "Yes" because the array is already sorted.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array is in descending order and has a large number of elements. The function should return "No" because the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the array has a large number of elements and all elements are the same. The function should return "Yes" because the array is already sorted.

# Test 8
