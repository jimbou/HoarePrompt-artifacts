```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where there is only one problem, and the difficulty of the proposed problem is lower than the expected difficulty. The function should return 0, indicating that no new problems need to be proposed.

# Test 6

[1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of problems is 100, and the difficulties of the proposed problems are equal to the expected difficulties. The function should return 0, indicating that no new problems need to be proposed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```

[1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
[2, 3, 4, ..., 101]
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of problems is 100, and the difficulties of the proposed problems are lower than the expected difficulties. The function should return 1, indicating that one new problem needs to be proposed to meet the expected difficulties.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1

[2, 3, 4, ..., 101]
[1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the edge scenario where the number of problems is 100, and the difficulties of the proposed problems are higher than the expected difficulties. The function should return 0, indicating that no new problems need to be proposed.
