# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
2
5
13
37
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
3
0 1 0
5
2 2 3 4 2
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the function with different inputs. It checks if the function can correctly generate arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is 1. The expected output is an array with a single element, which has only one increasing subsequence.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2^64
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that exceeds the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is 0. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with zero increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a negative number. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with a negative number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2^64 - 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that is one less than the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that is equal to the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10^18 + 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that exceeds the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2^63
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that is equal to half of the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2^63 - 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can handle the edge case where the input is a large number that is one less than half of the maximum limit. The expected output is -1, indicating that it is impossible to find an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.
