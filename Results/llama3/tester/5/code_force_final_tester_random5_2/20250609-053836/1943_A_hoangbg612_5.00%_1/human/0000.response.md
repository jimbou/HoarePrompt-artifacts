# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array has two 0s and two 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, and Bob should choose 1. The final array c will be [1, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has consecutive integers from 0 to n-1. Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, Alice should choose 2, and Bob should choose 3. The final array c will be [0, 2], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has only one element, which is 1. Alice should choose 1, and Bob should choose the remaining 1. The final array c will be [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has only one element, which is 0. Alice should choose 0, and the game will end. The final array c will be [0], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has multiple 0s and 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, and Alice should choose the remaining 0. The final array c will be [1, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has multiple 0s and 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, Alice should choose 0, and Bob should choose the remaining 0. The final array c will be [1, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has multiple 0s and 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 0, and Alice should choose the remaining 0. The final array c will be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has multiple 0s and 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, and Bob should choose the remaining 0. The final array c will be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the input array has multiple 0s and 1s. Alice should choose 1, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 1, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 0, Alice should choose 0, Bob should choose 0, and Alice should choose the remaining 0. The final array c will be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a MEX of 2.
