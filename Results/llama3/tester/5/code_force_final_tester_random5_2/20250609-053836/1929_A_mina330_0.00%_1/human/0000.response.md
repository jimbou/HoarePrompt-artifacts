# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The input array is [2, 1, 3]. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2, 3]. The beauty of this array is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
69 69 69
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all elements in the array are the same. In this case, the beauty of the array is 0, as there is no difference between any two elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**: 
```
57
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains a mix of small and large numbers. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty of this array is (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains duplicate elements. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [3, 3, 3, 4]. The beauty of this array is (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains only two elements. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2]. The beauty of this array is (2 - 1) = 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains only two identical elements. The beauty of this array is 0, as there is no difference between the two elements.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains only one element. The beauty of this array is 0, as there are no pairs of elements to calculate the difference.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array is empty. The beauty of this array is 0, as there are no elements to calculate the difference.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the array contains a large number of elements. The maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]. The beauty of this array is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + ... + (100 - 99) = 99.
