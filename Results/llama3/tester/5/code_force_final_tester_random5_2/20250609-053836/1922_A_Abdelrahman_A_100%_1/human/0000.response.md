# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function. The strings "a" and "b" match the template "C" (since 'a' and 'b' are different from 'c'), while the string "c" does not match.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
bb
aa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have the same character at the same position, but the string "c" has the same character at the same position as "a". In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at the same position, and the string "c" has different characters at the same position as "a" and "b". In this case, a template can be created to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at the same position, but the string "c" has the same character at the same position as "a" or "b". In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all strings have the same character at the same position. In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
a
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at the same position, and the string "c" has the same character at the same position as "a". In this case, a template can be created to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where all strings have the same characters at the same position, and the length of the strings is the maximum allowed (20). In this case, there is no template that can distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
a
b
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have different characters at the same position, and the string "c" has the same character at the same position as "a". In this case, a template can be created to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
aaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaab
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have the same characters at the same position, but the string "c" has a different character at the same position as "a" and "b". In this case, a template can be created to distinguish between "a" and "c".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
20
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the strings "a" and "b" have the same characters at the same position, but the string "c" has a different character at the same position as "a" and "b", and the length of the strings is the maximum allowed (20). In this case, a template can be created to distinguish between "a" and "c".
