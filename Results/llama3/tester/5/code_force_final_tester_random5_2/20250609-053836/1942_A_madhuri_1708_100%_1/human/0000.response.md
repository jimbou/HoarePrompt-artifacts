# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is an array with two elements, both of which are 1, because this array has two sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
69420 69 420
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 3 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with three elements, where the first element is larger than the second and third elements, because this array has only one sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 3 and k = 2. The expected output is -1, because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with one element, which is 1, because this array has one sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 ... 1 (1000 times)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1000 and k = 1000. The expected output is an array with 1000 elements, all of which are 1, because this array has 1000 sorted cyclic shifts.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 ... 1000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1000 and k = 1. The expected output is an array with 1000 elements, where each element is larger than the previous one, because this array has only one sorted cyclic shift.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 10 and k = 5. The expected output is -1, because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 5 and k = 3. The expected output is -1, because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 8 and k = 4. The expected output is -1, because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
15 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 15 and k = 10. The expected output is -1, because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.
