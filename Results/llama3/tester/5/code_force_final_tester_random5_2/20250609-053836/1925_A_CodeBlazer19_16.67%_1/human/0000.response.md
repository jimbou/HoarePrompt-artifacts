# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 1. The expected output is a single character 'a' since there is only one possible string of length 1 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 1. The expected output is 'aa' since there is only one possible string of length 2 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 2. The expected output is 'baab' since there are four possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first two lowercase English alphabets, and 'baab' is one of the possible outputs.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abcbac
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 2 and k = 3. The expected output is 'abcbac' since there are nine possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first three lowercase English alphabets, and 'abcbac' is one of the possible outputs.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 26. The expected output is the string containing all 26 lowercase English alphabets.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
26 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 26 and k = 1. The expected output is a string of 26 'a's since there is only one possible string of length 26 that can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (26 times)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 26 and k = 26. The expected output is a string containing all 26 lowercase English alphabets repeated 26 times.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(empty string)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 0 and k = 1. The expected output is an empty string since there are no possible strings of length 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
(error or exception)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 0. The expected output is an error or exception since k cannot be 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(error or exception)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = -1 and k = 1. The expected output is an error or exception since n cannot be negative.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
(error or exception)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = -1. The expected output is an error or exception since k cannot be negative.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
27 1
```
**Output**: 
```
(error or exception)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 27 and k = 1. The expected output is an error or exception since n cannot be greater than 26.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1 27
```
**Output**: 
```
(error or exception)
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n = 1 and k = 27. The expected output is an error or exception since k cannot be greater than 26.
