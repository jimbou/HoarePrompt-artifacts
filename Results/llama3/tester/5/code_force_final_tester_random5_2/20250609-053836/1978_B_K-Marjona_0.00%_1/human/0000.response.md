```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle cases where the number of buns is small and the price of the first bun is higher than the usual price.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's performance with extremely large inputs, ensuring it can handle cases where the number of buns and prices are at their maximum allowed values.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
**Description**: This test case verifies the function's behavior when the number of buns is extremely large, and the price of the first bun is at its minimum allowed value.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
**Description**: This test case evaluates the function's ability to handle cases where the number of buns is moderate, and the price of the first bun is significantly higher than the usual price.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks the function's behavior with the smallest possible inputs, ensuring it can handle the minimum allowed values for the number of buns and prices.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
