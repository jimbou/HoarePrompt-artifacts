# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input permutation is already sorted, and the target number is at its correct position. The expected output is 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, but can be reached by swapping two elements. The expected output is 1, indicating one operation is needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, and two operations are needed to reach it. The expected output is 2, indicating two operations are needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped in each operation.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, and two operations are needed to reach it. The expected output is 2, indicating two operations are needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped in each operation.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, but can be reached by swapping two elements. The expected output is 1, indicating one operation is needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input permutation has only one element, and the target number is that element. The expected output is 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, but can be reached by swapping two elements. The expected output is 1, indicating one operation is needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input permutation is already sorted, and the target number is at its correct position. The expected output is 0, indicating no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the input permutation is already sorted, and the target number is at its correct position. The expected output is 0, indicating no operations are needed. This test case also covers the maximum possible input size.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
200000 1
200000 199999 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
1 200000
1 2
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the scenario where the target number is not at its correct position, and two operations are needed to reach it. The expected output is 2, indicating two operations are needed, followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped in each operation. This test case also covers the maximum possible input size.
