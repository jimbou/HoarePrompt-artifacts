**Description**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the program. It includes a single test case with 5 cities and 5 queries. The queries cover different scenarios, such as traveling from the first city to the last city, traveling between two adjacent cities, and traveling from the last city to the first city.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 10
1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where there are only two cities. The program should correctly calculate the distance between the two cities.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1
1 10
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the cities are consecutive integers. The program should correctly calculate the distance between the first and last cities.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 1000000000 2000000000 3000000000 4000000000
1
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
3000000000
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the cities are very far apart. The program should correctly calculate the distance between the first and last cities.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
1
1 5
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the cities are very close together. The program should correctly calculate the distance between the first and last cities.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
5 1
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the query is in reverse order (i.e., from the last city to the first city). The program should correctly calculate the distance.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the query is for the same city. The program should correctly return 0 as the distance.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
6 1
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid city index
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the query includes an invalid city index. The program should correctly return an error message.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
1 6
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid city index
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the query includes an invalid city index. The program should correctly return an error message.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
0
```
**Output**:
```
Error: Invalid number of test cases
```
**Description**: This test case covers the edge case where the input is empty. The program should correctly return an error message.
