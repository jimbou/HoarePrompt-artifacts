# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the basic functionality of the function when both n and m are 1. The only valid pair is (1,1).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are small. The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are relatively small. The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,3).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are moderate. The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), and (10,2).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
153
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are large. The valid pairs are too numerous to list, but the function should return the correct count.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n and m are very large. The valid pairs are too numerous to list, but the function should return the correct count.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is 1 and m is very large. The only valid pair is (1,1).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is very large and m is 1. The only valid pair is (1,1).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when both n and m are very large. The valid pairs are too numerous to list, but the function should return the correct count.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is small and m is very large. The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's behavior when n is very large and m is small. The valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2).
