# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function handles a single stick correctly, which is not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function handles two sticks of the same length correctly, which is still not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function can form a polygon with the given sticks. In this case, a square can be formed with the four sticks of length 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function can form multiple polygons with the given sticks. In this case, a pentagon can be formed with the five sticks of length 2, and a square can be formed with the four sticks of length 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function handles a large number of sticks of the same length correctly, which is still not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function handles a small number of sticks of different lengths correctly, which is not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
20
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function handles a large number of sticks of the same length correctly, which is still not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
15
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case verifies if the function handles a large number of sticks of different lengths correctly, which is not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
25
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Description**: This test case checks if the function handles a very large number of sticks of the same length correctly, which is still not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 10
