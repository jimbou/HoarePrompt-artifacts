#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The count of zeros in the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the number of cells, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) indicating the presence of chips in the cells. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of remaining zeros. For each test case, it prints the count of zeros.
